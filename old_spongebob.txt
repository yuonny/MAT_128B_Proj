[Following the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song, the brief opening titles show the names of creator Stephen Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, and others. The episode opens with a bubble transition, and we see a coral reef under the sea. The camera zooms to initiate parallax scrolling, which reveals the city of Bikini Bottom. It continues zooming to show a brown rock, a Moai head, and a pineapple, which each contain inhabitants.]
French Narrator: Ah, the sea... so fascinating. So wonderful. Here, we see Bikini Bottom, teeming with life. [Shows from left to right Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses. Zooms in on SpongeBob's house.] Home to one of my favorite creatures, SpongeBob SquarePants. Yes, of course he lives in a pineapple, you silly. [Scene cuts to the house's bedroom. A sea snail is seen sleeping near a pile of newspapers on the floor, a scallop is seen in a birdcage, and a young, optimistic sea sponge is seen sleeping in his bed, snoring as his foghorn alarm clock ticks. SpongeBob's alarm then sounds. He wakes, but is unaffected by the annoying sound, and with a smile on his face, turns it off. He climbs from his bed to a ladder, leading to his diving board.]
SpongeBob SquarePants: Today's the big day, Gary!
Gary the Snail: Meow.
SpongeBob: [jumps on the diving board] Look at me, I'm... [jumps up, and leaves his underwear behind] ...naked! [Lands inside pants, walks over to exercise room. His head pops out of the top of his pants.] Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [He goes inside his small gym room that has a sign that reads "l Love Pain." Taking deep breaths, he prepares to lift a barbell that is balanced by two lightweight stuffed animals. He sticks out his chest, but almost passes out because he can barely lift it. He drops it, and it makes a "squeak" noise] I'm ready!!! [runs outside] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! [A dimwitted sea star's rock tilts upwards with him stuck to its underside.]
Patrick Star: Go, SpongeBob! [Patrick falls] Whoa! [crash sound effect]
 SpongeBob (1997 Version): I'm ready! I'm ready! [SpongeBob jumps in the air as the scene freezes and a title reads SpongeBob SquarePants]
 Narrator (1997 Version)&#160;: SpongeBob SquarePants! [It shows SpongeBob running through various landscapes, as it shows a frozen scene of SpongeBob standing in front of the Krusty Krab the scene unfreezes and then the episode continues as normal]
SpongeBob: [runs down the street to the Krusty Krab] There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating: The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty... with a Help Wanted sign in the window. For years I've been dreaming of this moment. I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'im straight in the eye [breaks the fourth wall and looks the audience in the eye], lay it on the line and... I can't do this! [He starts to run home, but Patrick stops him.] Hey, Patrick-
Patrick: Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob: I was just...
Patrick: No, you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get! That! Job!
SpongeBob: I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Whose first words were "May I take your order?"?
SpongeBob: Mine were.
Patrick: Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
SpongeBob: I did.
Patrick: [grimaces and contorts twice while trying to come up with a good third line] Who's a, uh, who's uhh, oh! And who's the big yellow cube with holes?
SpongeBob: I am!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?!
SpongeBob: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. An octopus is seen cleaning graffiti on the restaurant's windows.]
Squidward Tentacles: [cleaning graffiti of himself with the word "loser," sees SpongeBob, and sighs] Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
SpongeBob: [in background, at first while Squidward was talking] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, self! [Squidward looks at the Help Wanted sign, screams, and runs inside.]
Squidward: [While SpongeBob says, "I'm ready," one more time in the background] Mr. Krabs! [cuts to the ordering window, where a greedy crab is seen happily sniffing a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him.] Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you- [interrupted by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard, captain. [deep voice] I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew [normal voice] and now I'm ready. [SpongeBob trips on a nail stuck in the floorboard. Mr. Krabs and Squidward look at each other. His fall causes him to bounce against the ceiling. SpongeBob shouts and blurts incomprehensibly while his bounces and ricochets around the building accelerate. He then rolls to a stop at the feet of Squidward and Mr. Krabs.] So, uh, when do I start?
Eugene H. Krabs: Well, lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward quickly walk away from SpongeBob]
Squidward: [deep breath] No. [Mr. Krabs winks. They head back to SpongeBob, who looks completely puzzled at what he's hearing]
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad, we'll give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew. Go out and fetch me... [SpongeBob takes out a notepad] a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula... [SpongeBob quickly jots down what he says] with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments, [more scribbling] and, uh... turbo drive. [more scribbling] And don't come back ‘til you get one. [Mr. Krabs puts a Krusty Krab crew hat on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob sees how he looks in a mirror, there are sparkles on his hat, and he has a huge, satisfied smile]
SpongeBob: [saluting Krabs] Aye aye, captain! [reading] One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, Sir!
Mr. Krabs: Carry on! [SpongeBob leaves] We'll never see that lubber again.
Squidward: You're terrible. A hydro-what? [Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh. While Squidward laughs, his nose moves distinctly while he inhales and exhales. Krabs laugh sounds like a pirate. As they laugh, SpongeBob is shown leaving the Krusty Krab. As SpongeBob fades out of sight, five buses drive toward the Krusty Krab from the opposite direction.]
Bus driver: Hey! Hey! Please! Passengers are to stay seated and not put their fins out the window! [The buses surround the Krusty Krab and the doors open; Mr. Krabs stops laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] That sounded like hatch doors! [sniffs repeatedly] Do you smell it? That smell... A kind of smelly smell... A smelly smell that smells... smelly... [his eyes widen] Anchovies.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: Anchovies!! [Anchovies get out of the buses and rush inside the Krusty Krab, crowding, repeating the word "meep" over and over again]
Squidward: Please, please, quiet! [Anchovies stop talking] Is this any way to behave, hmmm?
Anchovy: Meep.
Squidward: Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register? [The anchovies stare for a moment, then pick up the boat, as their cries of "meep!" become more intense. Cut to Barg'N-Mart as SpongeBob enters.]
SpongeBob: [singing to himself] ♪ Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs. ♪  [cuts back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are still in the boat register, and being tossed around like a ship in a storm.]
Mr. Krabs: All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
Squidward: One single file line was all I asked!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! [Mr. Krabs and Squidward are thrown up in the air]  Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again; the boat is in splinters] We're taking on water, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again, with Krabs clutching Squidward] I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! [cuts to Barg'N-Mart]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments. ♪ [cuts back to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Help!
Mr. Krabs: Man overboard! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! [They climb the mast, while the anchovies try to get them down. The anchovies then form a big wave.]
Anchovies: Meep! Meep!
Mr. Krabs: This is the end! Goodbye, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! [They cry, then SpongeBob comes in with red lights flashing and flying with the spatula, singing a heroic tune]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stuttering in shock at SpongeBob getting the hydrodynamic spatula]
SpongeBob: That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with [two spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one] port-and-starboard attachments! And let's not forget the turbo drive! [the two extending spatulas twirl around and smack Squidward and Mr. Krabs in the face] Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! [to the anchovies] Who's hungry?! [Tiny Tim's "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" plays while SpongeBob serves up Krabby Patty after Krabby Patty. Numerous Krabby Patties are launched through the opening window to the hungry anchovies. Eventually, all of the anchovies are served and they leave on the buses. SpongeBob blows the spatula. Cuts to later.]
Mr. Krabs: That was the finest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants. Welcome aboard. [Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob a name tag]
Squidward: B-but, but, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
Squidward: [weakly] Hooray, Mr.-
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray. Mr. Krabs-
Mr. Krabs: I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty. [He wheels a wheelbarrow piled with an enormous stack of cash to his office. Patrick enters]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Squidward: What would you like to order, Patrick?
Patrick: One Krabby Patty, please. [The instrumental to "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" starts playing. SpongeBob flies back to the kitchen, using his spatula, and a score of Krabby Patties is immediately fired through the servery, which collide with Patrick and send him flying out of the Krusty Krab. Cuts to Krusty Krab exterior; crashing noises.]
Patrick: [screams]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [singsong] Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee...!


[The episode opens up with SpongeBob's, Patrick's, and Squidward's houses.]
[Squidward opens his door, sees that a flower does not stand up straight and then fixes it.]
[The scene pans to show that everything on his lawn is clean, except for a seashell on the left side of it.]
[The camera shows Squidward angry. He walks over to the seashell, looks around and kicks it onto SpongeBob's lawn while whistling casually.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's house. The window opens, and SpongeBob's face is shown. He exits through his window and sits on its rim. He notices the seashell on his lawn, he gets an idea and starts sliding to the back of his house to his garage to get a reef blower. The giant backpack-like container, with a blower hose, which looks like a jet engine, a power switch, and a pull starter.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward resting on his hammock.]
[Squidward hears the reef blower's motor throbbing. He sees SpongeBob exiting out of his garage with the reef blower. Squidward grumbles and puts in his ear plugs so that he can continue to rest.]
[SpongeBob gets to the seashell and tries to blow it away from his lawn by using the reef blower. He does this twice. He then blows extra hard, and a huge amount of sand is thrown in the air.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward eating some vegetables when the huge amount of sand falls from the sky and buries him. SpongeBob runs towards Squidward and blows the sand away.]
[Squidward looks at a leaf on his plate with grains of sand on it.]
[SpongeBob cleans the leaf in front of Squidward's head, tearing apart half of the leaf and causing grains of sand to get into Squidward's eyes. SpongeBob cleans Squidward's eyes with another blow.]
[The scene changes to show a large pile of sand on SpongeBob's lawn.]
[SpongeBob points his finger to it and mouths a word and the caption says "You!". He walks to the pile of sand, sets the reef blower to reverse and uses it suck up the sand from his lawn.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's lawn clean, but then reef blower starts breaking apart, throwing out sand and parts of the machinery.]
[SpongeBob takes off the reef blower. He unzips the pack. He goes over to pick up the thrown out contents. The reef blower coughs while he is absent. He returns with large hands carrying the thrown out contents. He zips it back up and pulls the pull starter in an attempt to try to start it. The motor starts and then dies.]
[The camera shows him becoming angry or just determined. The scene changes and he pulls the handle very far.]
[SpongeBob lets go of the handle, which stays still. SpongeBob wipes his hands together. He grabs the handle again. The handle pulls him away, leaving a bubble silhouette of SpongeBob that quickly dissolves. SpongeBob passes an intersection where two fish in two different cars going opposite directions stop. He passes some houses and finally returns to the reef blower, where he gets strapped in.]
[The reef blower starts, sucking up all the water in the sea, causing Squidward, who is sitting on his front doorstep, to gasp due to the inability to breathe air. His eyes also change into X's.]
[The scene changes to show the reef blower massive, and then it explodes, causing water to cover the screen. When the water stops, the screen shows big piles of sand everywhere, but SpongeBob's lawn is relatively clean.]
[SpongeBob exits one of the piles, wipes his hands together, and happily enters his house.]
[Episode ends with Squidward at his doorstep, with a pile of sand covering him except for his head. The seashell falls on Squidward's nose. Squidward narrows his eyelids.]


SpongeBob: [Stands in Jellyfish Fields. A blue jellyfish floats by SpongeBob. SpongeBob creeps from behind a bush and stares at the jellyfish through a telescope. Cuts to his view with the telescope] Wow, four stingers. [Puts away the telescope and puts on his glasses. Cuts to the jellyfish, where SpongeBob floats over it with his net. Cuts to the jellyfish alone, where SpongeBob's foot stretches out from off-screen and then the rest of his body appears. He attempts to grab the jellyfish in his net, but he catches himself in the net, then the jellyfish flies away. In the background, a young girl's voice is heard struggling. SpongeBob looks down a cliff and sees the land creature trying to fight a giant clam attempting. SpongeBob gasps.] Where have I seen this before? [takes out his Field Guide book and skims through the pages] Here it is. [cut to picture of a squirrel] Land squirrel. [He closes the book] That little squirrel is in trouble. [cuts to the squirrel, who is pushing the clam into the ground]
Sandy Cheeks: Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners! [she walks away] You're about as ugly as homemade soup.
SpongeBob: Hooray, land squirrel! [cuts back to the land squirrel, who is oblivious to the clam resurfacing and jumping right at her. Cuts to SpongeBob, who is shocked, his glasses shoot up] Look out! [scene cuts to the clam with Sandy trying to escape the clam] Hold on, little squirrel! [He does a karate yell in front of the clam, then does the same while bouncing to different sides. He jumps high in the air, and lands on top of the clam; he poses on top of the giant clam.] You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai! [tries to pry open the clam; he stops] Hey, I'm actually doing it. [SpongeBob continues, Sandy finishes prying the clam open from inside it and SpongeBob goes flying into a sea plant.] Your shell is mine! 
[SpongeBob pulls up his pants and starts to charge at the clam. He jumps into the clam's mouth and starts to strangle its tongue. SpongeBob sees that Sandy has already escaped and the clam swallows him now.] 
Sandy: Hold on there, little square dude! [She then gets SpongeBob out and kicks the clam around some more and finally kicks it across the sea. The clam whimpers. Sandy leans down to see if SpongeBob is okay.] 
SpongeBob: Hey, you like karate too. [SpongeBob does some karate poses, then he stops and falls flat on his head] So, uhh, what's your name? 
Sandy: Sandy. [makes athletic moves] So what do y'all call yourself? 
SpongeBob: [runs up a big rock] I'm SpongeBob! [jumps down, SpongeBob soon lands on one of his corners] 
Sandy: Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this. [she walks next to a huge rock and slaps it with her hand, making a gong sound effect which precedes the rock breaking into pieces] 
SpongeBob: Oh. [Sandy grins and blinks] Oh yeah? Watch this [He prepares to do a karate move, but all he does is make an armpit fart noise. Sandy walks on-screen giggling] 
Sandy: I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah![Karate chops SpongeBob’s head.] 
SpongeBob: Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah! [Karate chops her helmet, but realizes it hurts.] Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head? 
Sandy: Why, that's my air helmet. 
SpongeBob: May I try it on? 
Sandy: Heck no. I need it to breathe. I gotta have my air. 
SpongeBob: Me too. I love air. Air is good. 
Sandy: No kidding? 
SpongeBob: Why, "air" is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air. 
Sandy: Shee-oot. How about comin' over tomorrow for tea and cookies then? [shows a map leading to Sandy's house] Don't be late. 
SpongeBob: Okay, see you tomorrow. [runs to Patrick's house. Patrick is sun tanning on his rock] Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air? 
Patrick: Huh? 
SpongeBob: I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air. 
Patrick: Do you mean she puts on "airs"? 
SpongeBob: I guess so. 
Patrick: That's just fancy talk. If you wanna be fancy, hold your pinky up like this. The higher you hold it, the fancier you are. 
SpongeBob: [holds his pinky up] How's that? 
Patrick: Higher. 
SpongeBob: Like that? 
Patrick: Now that's fancy. They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants. [cuts to Sandy's treedome] Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching. [Opens the door as SpongeBob walks in with his pinky raised high and flowers in his right hand.] 
SpongeBob: Thanks, pal. [rings the doorbell with a bouquet in his hand] 
Sandy: Hello? 
SpongeBob: Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob. 
Sandy: Hold on a sec, I'll let you in. 
SpongeBob: [whistles then all the water goes down the drain. SpongeBob bangs on the door] Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy! [Sandy opens the door and SpongeBob jiggles on the ground] Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in... [looks around] ...here. 
Sandy: ‘Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air. 
SpongeBob: [waves his hand around and smells the air] No water? 
Sandy: That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah! 
SpongeBob: Problem? [laughing] Hi-yah! That's how I like my air! [takes a deep breath as Sandy walks off. As soon as she leaves, he lets it all out, and gets black circles around his eyes] With no water. 
Sandy: [cartwheeling] Well, alright. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah! [SpongeBob is walking an inch forward and it makes weak squeaking sounds with every step] That's not in. In. [SpongeBob walks another inch and there is more squeaking. Sandy runs, gets SpongeBob, takes his hand, and runs off] You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour. [fades to the blazing sun and pan down where Sandy and SpongeBob are standing] So this is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest... [SpongeBob gasps] ...purest... [SpongeBob gasps again] ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath. [Cuts to the birdbath, where a red robin is splashing and chirping] And that's my oak tree. [SpongeBob seems enticed by the water in the birdbath. He tries to sneak away, but stays until Sandy lets her guard down] It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bees knees? [SpongeBob nods] Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I... [SpongeBob finally escapes and wallows in the birdbath, absorbing all the water. He then jumps back to his original spot, and the bird is quite angry. SpongeBob gets back before Sandy notices] ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Let’s have that tea now. [Does in-air karate moves and moves off-screen. SpongeBob gasps. He hears some knocking from outside. It's Patrick, pointing at his pinky] 
Patrick: Pinky. Pinky. 
SpongeBob: [blinks, weakly holds up his pinky, and gasps again. Fade to him sitting at a picnic bench. He now has little wrinkles around his eyes and his mouth is all puckered up. He holds up his bouquet] I brought you some flowers. 
Sandy: [walks over] For me? How sweet. [Sandy grabs the flowers, but SpongeBob refuses to let go. She finally pries them loose and part of SpongeBob's pinky falls off. He closes his hand] You okay? 
SpongeBob: [the black circles around his eyes are gone. His voice is now hoarse] Yes, I'm okay. 
Sandy: You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit. 
SpongeBob: I can’t imagine why. 
Sandy: Can I get you anything? 
SpongeBob: Water would be nice. 
Sandy: I'm gonna to put these in a vase. 
SpongeBob: Take your time. [Sandy goes in her tree and closes the door off-screen. SpongeBob hears it, he then gasps and stumbles toward the door and struggles to open it] I gotta get out of here! [screams and then thinks] 
Sandy: [in SpongeBob's head] I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree. 
[SpongeBob struggles even more] 
Patrick: [in SpongeBob's head] When in doubt, pinky out. 
SpongeBob: [lifts his pinky up. He then gets confidence and victorious music plays.] I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... [he then sits down, loses confidence again and the music stops] 
Sandy: Why, these flowers are just beautiful! [sniffs] They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice cold water. [puts the vase down. SpongeBob is totally enticed by the water. Sandy sits down across from him] So tell me about yourself. [Sandy puts her hands under head feeling fascinated about SpongeBob sharing himself] It must be fascinating bein' a sea critter. [SpongeBob watches a drop of water drop down the side of the glass] SpongeBob? [a timer goes off] Oh, there's the cookies. [walks back into the tree] Be right back. 
SpongeBob: [thinking] I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face. He's really shriveled now] I don't need it. [close-up of vase, then another one of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [close-up of vase] I don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [long pause, finally yelling ] I need it! [He shoots up into the air, bounces off the ceiling and holds the vase.] 
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!
SpongeBob: [holds up his pinky and starts guzzling down the whole vase of water] I'm a quitter! [screams and runs around] 
Patrick: [enters into the dome and slams the door shut] You can't leave now. You'll blow it.
SpongeBob: [hanging on the door] Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good.
Patrick: [grabs SpongeBob off the door] You're just being shy. [carries SpongeBob to the picnic table] Don't worry, buddy. You're doi'’ fine. [starts getting weak] I won't let you blow... this. [drops SpongeBob and crawls on the floor, panting. He coughs and sputters, then stands up] What kind of place is this?! [runs toward the door and tries to open it] There's no water in here!
SpongeBob: [joins in on the door-opening struggle] I tried to tell you!
Patrick: We've gotta get out of here!
SpongeBob: You're... doing it... wrong...
Patrick: Wait, no! We've got... to get... out. [The two pass out.]
[fades to the sun]
Sandy: [walks out of the tree with tea and cookies] Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this...
[She screams and drops her tray. On the grass is a live-action sponge and starfish. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick leaning against a ladder with two goldfish helmets on. Sandy, on top of the ladder, uses a hose to fill those helmets with water.] 
Sandy: There, that oughta do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked. [Sandy carries over a tray with three tea glasses. Everyone takes one] I propose a toast, to new friends. [She drinks it. SpongeBob and Patrick lift their drinks up and they clink the glasses on the helmets, causing them to spill] Hold on a second. [She places a tea bag in each helmet, allowing the two to drink the tea water] I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up. [Patrick nudges SpongeBob and they both put their pinkies up. They sip the tea.] 
All: Ahhh... 
[Screen cuts to black.]


[Pan across Goo Lagoon]
Narrator: Ah, Goo. Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me, but to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful, stinky mud puddle. [SpongeBob and Sandy sit enjoying the beach. SpongeBob sighs]
SpongeBob: What a great day. [he runs off] Hey, Sandy... look! [he is now covered in a mound of sand] I'm Sandy!!
Sandy: Hahahahaha!
SpongeBob: [Sandy laughs. SpongeBob forms sand around his head and nose to look like Squidward and imitates his voice] Hey Sandy, who am I? [Sandy still laughs. SpongeBob picks up a sand phone] Hello, SpongeBob? Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. [Sandy continues laughing]
Sandy: SpongeBob! [a doorbell rings, SpongeBob walks in carrying sand pizza boxes and wearing a Krusty Krab sand hat]
SpongeBob: Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? [SpongeBob and Sandy laugh together. Larry walks up]
Larry the Lobster: Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.
Sandy: Hey, Larry.
Larry: You guys wanna go lift some weights?
Sandy: Sure. [she and Larry walk off] Well, come on, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob's sand pizzas and hat fall flat as he walks on dejectedly]
SpongeBob: [disappointingly] Coming. [Cut to a group of weightlifters, each grunting as they work out. Larry turns to Sandy]
Larry: Give it a try, Sandy. [Sandy stands in front of a weight. She picks it up, grunting as she does so. The crowd cheers for her, and she throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? [SpongeBob tries to walk off]
Larry: How about a little more weight? [Larry bends down to pick up a weight heavier than Sandy's] Observe. [Larry grunts as he picks it up, his eyes bulging, and veins stick out from his neck. The crowd cheers, and Larry throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: All right! Stand back, everyone! [SpongeBob picks up a single twig from the ground. The crowd is silent. He sinks into the sand. Sandy walks to a weight]
Sandy: Y'all watch this! [Sandy picks up an anchor weight. The crowd cheers for her, but stop when they realize Larry has lifted the spectator stands] Way to go, Larry! [SpongeBob burrows into the sand, and tunnels over to a fish picnicking next to a marshmallow sack]
SpongeBob: Could I borrow a couple of these?
Darwin: [through his marshmallow-filled mouth] Mm-hmm. [crams another marshmallow into his mouth.]
SpongeBob: [takes two marshmallows and places them on the twig] And now, with the addition of two, COUNT 'EM, two marshmallows! [SpongeBob preps himself for his lift, inhales deeply, takes hold of the twig, and is unable to lift it. The crowd isn't moved. He tries again. And again. After a huge effort, SpongeBob hears a rip. He looks down and notices that he's ripped his pants. The crowd gasps, then laughs at SpongeBob. SpongeBob scuttles off, embarrassed. Scooter walks over, laughing]
Scooter: That was too funny. [he slaps SpongeBob on the back] You are hilarious!
Sandy: Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw? [SpongeBob grins widely. Cut to Larry]
Larry: Anybody up for some volleyball? [the ball volleys back and forth, until Larry spikes it into some fish and the crowd cheers for him. SpongeBob looks at him in contempt. A fish serves the ball and as Larry is about to hit it, SpongeBob interferes]
SpongeBob: I got it! [the ball falls and SpongeBob tries to serve it] Incoming! [the serve misses and the crowd boos. He bends down to pick the ball up and rips his pants] Oops... I guess I ripped my pants again! [the crowd laughs. Scooter walks in laughing again]
Scooter: Once again, dude, [he slaps SpongeBob on the back] YOU have split my sides! [he continues to laugh. Cut to a Frisbee. Larry catches it and throws it to Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?
Sandy: Okay, here it comes! [SpongeBob stands still and lets the Frisbee hit him on the head, knocking him over]
SpongeBob: I could use a hand here! [he laughs. Sandy walks over and helps him up]
Sandy: You okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess so... [he does a handstand, revealing his pants] ...except I ripped my pants! [the crowd laughs, and Scooter walks up to SpongeBob once again]
Scooter: You still got it, dude! [he slaps SpongeBob on the back again. Cut to SpongeBob and Sandy walking to an ice cream vendor]
Lou Vendor: May I help you?
SpongeBob: I'll take a banana split.
Lou: Uh, we don't have that.
SpongeBob: That's okay, I already "split" my pants! Get it??? [Sandy giggles]
Lou: [annoyed] Tee-hee. Anything else?
SpongeBob: How about, ripple? [he does so, Sandy giggles again] No, thanks, already got one. [Sandy drops laughing, Lou is unamused, and SpongeBob happily bounces off to a snack bar. SpongeBob runs up to Harold, knocking his drink over] Is that a burger you're eating?
Harold: Why, yes, it is.
SpongeBob: You know what would go good with that?
Harold: No, what?
SpongeBob: [whispers] Ripped... pants... [SpongeBob smiles widely and shows the annoyed Harold his ripped pants. SpongeBob then runs around the snack bar, laughing. He comes up in-between two fish] Ripped pants a la mode! [he rips his pants, the fish are annoyed. Cut to SpongeBob being in the kitchen of the snack bar, next to the fry cook] Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? [SpongeBob shoves his behind through the box, revealing his ripped pants. He laughs and the box is revealed to have no lower part. The fry cook groans disgustedly. Cut to a broadcasting booth over looking the lagoon]
Perch Perkins: Surf's up in the Goo Lagoon. [fish are surfing. Close-up of Perch Perkins] And here comes Larry, doing his trademark lay-back. [cut to Larry lying on his surfboard] There goes Sandy, hanging ten... fingers, that is. [cut to Sandy doing a handstand on her surfboard] There goes SpongeBob... [rip] ripping his pants again. [Perch Perkins is annoyed, then cut to SpongeBob ripping his pants on his surfboard. A wave knocks SpongeBob off his surfboard and washes him up on the beach]
Lifeguard: Hey, look! A cardboard box washed up on the beach! [he takes a closer look through his telescope] HOLY FISH PASTE! IT'S A GUY!!! [he sprints over to SpongeBob and flips him over] WHY?! WWWUUHHHYYY-HY-HY-HY?!! WWWUUHHHHAAAAAA-HY-HYY-HYYY-HYYYYGH?????!!!!! [a crowd gathers around SpongeBob and the lifeguard]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [to lifeguard] Come closer... [a divine light shines on him] I need... I need...
Lifeguard: What do you need?! [tears come to the lifeguard's and Sandy's eyes]
SpongeBob: [pats the lifeguard on the shoulder. Close up of SpongeBob's mouth] A tailor. [the light turns off, accompanied by a light switch] Because I ripped my pants!! [he laughs. The lifeguard makes an annoyed expression, drops SpongeBob, and the crowd surrounding him walks off with annoyance. SpongeBob is left alone and Sandy walks up to him angry]
Sandy: That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick! [she walks off. Scooter walks towards SpongeBob and looks at him sadly]
Scooter: [he shakes his head] Dude... [he walks off. Cut to a dressing tent, with SpongeBob inside]
SpongeBob: [thinking] Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think. Your public's waiting. [speaking] Let's see... [checking them off a list] "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown," [he uses his pencil to write the word "NO" and circle it] Noooooooo. Come on, think. I got it! Hey, everybody! [he runs out of the dressing tent] Not ripped pants! [he tears his pants off] Pants ripped off! Huh? Someone call the police, there's a pants thief on the loose! [the wind howls, SpongeBob standing alone on the beach. A tumbleweed rolls by. SpongeBob turns and hears party music at a distance, and sees Larry and Sandy playing volleyball] Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. [lies on the beach as he continues saying, no] We blew it, pants. [throws his pants aside]
Pants: What do you mean, "we?" [the pants walk off, leaving SpongeBob alone]
SpongeBob: Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! [Millie walks up to SpongeBob, shining red]
Jennifer: No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen. [she places a fin on herself, and it leaves a sounding mark, which vanishes]
SpongeBob: Ouch. [a fish walks up to the two]
Dexter: No, I am. I got sand in my buns. [he shows them two sandy hamburger buns. There is a rumbling coming from the sand and a whale pops his head out of the sand]
Frank: No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.
All: What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I lost my best friend.
All: How? [SpongeBob grabs a sand guitar and sings]
SpongeBob: When I ripped... [his underwear starts ripping] my pants. [he starts to sing] I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I [rips his underwear again] ripped my pants. [the other three "losers of the beach" assemble on a sand stage with sand instruments and sing]
All: ♪When big Larry came round just to put him down, SpongeBob turned into a clown, and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and [Jennifer turns around and suddenly, her bottom then rips, splitting open, revealing her white underwear] ripped his pants!♪
SpongeBob: [singing voice, a crowd begins to gather] ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪
All: ♪Or sand in your buns!♪ [instrumental break. The sandy bun fish scrapes the two buns together to make a rhythm then the curtain shows waves crashing about]
SpongeBob: ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ [the whole group comes together one by one in sync with the music and they rip their pants. By now, a huge crowd has gathered and is cheering the group onstage. A blimp flies by with SpongeBob's name on it. It's revealed that SpongeBob and his band were having a concert.]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sandy! [she gets onstage and hugs SpongeBob. He returns the embrace]
Sandy: Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself. [Larry walks up]
Larry: [impressed with SpongeBob's singing during the big concert] SpongeBob, that was so righteous. [hands SpongeBob a pencil]  Would you... sign my pants??
SpongeBob: Absolutely, buddy. [SpongeBob bends down to sign Larry's pants. His underwear then rips off completely, leaving SpongeBob "au naturel." Someone off-screen whistles. SpongeBob covers his crotch, grins, and blushes sheepishly]


[View of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [from inside] One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day. [cut to inside of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [speaking in French accent] Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. [flips it up in the air and it falls into one of his holes. He holds up the other ingredients]
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Next, les ingredients. [throws them in the air] Ah, oui! [he catches them in his holes and his pants] Les mustard. [he squirts some mustard out and it lands in his eye]
Squidward: [speaking in French accent] Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Les hold on a second! [SpongeBob takes his head and shakes it all up. When he puts it back on his body, his eyes roll around] And voila! [He goes up to Squidward and pulls a Krabby Patty from under his nose; speaking in normal voice] It's under your nose! [Laughs and puts it on a plate. Squidward pretends to laugh]
Squidward: [speaking in normal voice] You're killing me, SpongeBob! Ha ha ha... you really are. [Close-up on the patty].
SpongeBob: Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty..
Squidward: Okay, give it to me. [The Krabby Patty flies off of the plate and starts bouncing all over the place] Come on SpongeBob, stop it!
SpongeBob: I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! [The patty slithers out the door and heads for the exit. Mr. Krabs spears it with his leg. A tiny thing comes out from it and Krabs inspects it with a magnifying glass.]
Mr. Krabs: Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is... [view of in the magnifying glass, of a tiny jelly bean-shaped green creature with one eye] Plankton! Stealing me booty!
Plankton: Hear me, Krabs! When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I'll run you out of business! I went to college! [Krabs picks up the puny pest] Hey! Let me go!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer! [laughs. He splats Plankton on a plate and spins him back across the street, to the Chum Bucket] Back to the Chum Bucket with you!
Plankton: You'll pay for this, Krabs! [slams through the doors]
SpongeBob: Uh... Plankton, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years, but you haven't got it yet, have ye, bug? [laughs. SpongeBob joins in, braying with laughter. Krabs stops, but SpongeBob keeps laughing] Okay. [SpongeBob keeps laughing] Enough, lad, it wasn't that funny. [SpongeBob keeps laughing] Get back to work! [SpongeBob stops laughing. Cut to nighttime at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [from inside] Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs: Good night, me boy! [SpongeBob walks out and walks past the Chum Bucket contently]
Plankton: [unseen] Psst... young man. [SpongeBob looks around to see where this voice came from] Yes, over here. Come on, boy, a little closer. [SpongeBob walks forward] Closer... [SpongeBob walks] Not that close! [a crunching sound is heard. SpongeBob lifts up his shoe revealing a squished Plankton] You blasted barnacle head! I mean... hi. [SpongeBob peels Plankton off his shoe and onto his hand]
SpongeBob: Plankton? What do you want?
Plankton: I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?
SpongeBob: Um... no.
Plankton: Acquaintances?
SpongeBob: No.
Plankton: Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?
SpongeBob: I... guess so.
Plankton: You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment. [rummages through his back pocket and takes out a golden spatula] Ching! [in unison with the sparkling of the spatula] Sparkle, sparkle.
SpongeBob: Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it.
Plankton: It's a gift! A gift from a friend. [hugs SpongeBob's thumb] Friends give each other gifts, and tomorrow is my birthday. [puts a birthday hat on his head and SpongeBob's thumb and then blows a noisemaker. He then takes out a cake] And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? [blows out the candles].
SpongeBob: A booster seat? [Plankton takes off the hat and throws out the cake]
Plankton: Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you, my friend, is one of those [starts to drool] tender... delicious... Krabby Patties! [SpongeBob drops Plankton and gasps]
SpongeBob: You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow!
Plankton: Gee, and I thought you were stupid.
SpongeBob: You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me! [walks off, then stops] Even if we are friends! [runs off] Never, never, never, never!
Plankton: Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool! [takes out a gramophone that plays evil music and laughs evilly to it. Cut to SpongeBob's bedroom, where SpongeBob goes to sleep]
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [Gary meows. SpongeBob goes to sleep. Just then, one of the flowers on SpongeBob's bed pattern pops up. It's Plankton in disguise, wearing a backpack that looks more like an antenna-like machine.]
Plankton: [chuckling] SpongeBob, you will be mine! [pulls out the record player and laughs evilly to it, but it actually plays a children's song of the A-B-C's.]
Woman in the recording: ♪Letters of the alphabet, A-B-C...♪
[Plankton immediately realizes this and flips the record around on the other side. It plays the evil music like last time and he laughs. Then he walks through one of SpongeBob's holes and begins his journey. Plankton reads a map that looks like a regular road map, except with a giant brain in the middle of it.]
Plankton: It should be in here... but where? [pan out to reveal he's standing on the brain] Where? Oh... [takes off the antenna thing on his back] This will be the beginning of the end! [outside, SpongeBob rolls to his left in his sleep. The brain falls to the right inside and Plankton falls off] Ouch! Stupid brain... [gives chase] Come back here, you swine! [SpongeBob then rolls to his right. Inside, the brain squishes Plankton. SpongeBob then sleeps on his back and the brain stops rolling. Plankton holds up a roll of duct tape] That's it, brain, you're going down! [Plankton uses tape to hold it down] Yes, yes, that's grand. [takes out blueprints] And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan. [the blueprints reveal a picture of the antenna thing labeled "Control" and an arrow pointing to a picture of a brain labeled "Brain." Plankton follows these instructions by jamming the control in the brain] And now, it's time for a little wakey-uppy. [his hands on the control levers, he uses his foot to press the "Total Control" button. Outside, SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Morning already? [Plankton jams the controls causing SpongeBob's legs to jam out to his side. He rumbles and falls down. Plankton laughs evilly] I... I feel a little funny today. [using the controls, he makes SpongeBob walk. Plankton laughs]
Plankton: I have you now! [outside, SpongeBob keeps walking towards the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Time for a well-balanced breakfast. [he rams through the wall and through his refrigerator, emerging with bread, a bottle of milk, and an egg carton on his head] This isn't what I had in mind. [he walks towards the straps with his pants attached] Let me just grab my pants. [he walks toward them and they spring him. He eventually gives free and keeps walking] I guess I'm not wearing any pants today. [he crashes through the side of the wall] I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess. [Gary meows] You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help! [inside Squidward's house, he tries to sleep. Off-screen] Squidward! Help!
Squidward: Be quiet, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob bursts through the wall of Squidward's bedroom]
SpongeBob: Help!
Squidward: SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad? [SpongeBob crashes through the opposite wall. He stops walking and his head turns around 180 degrees]
Plankton: [through SpongeBob] Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.
Squidward: Mediocre? [from inside, Plankton speaks through a microphone]
Plankton: You pretentious, little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste! [SpongeBob snaps out of it]
SpongeBob: Something must be wrong with my brain! [SpongeBob's eyes roll into the back of his head and he sees Plankton. Gasps] Plankton! [Plankton raises his eyebrow] What kind of friend are you?
Plankton: Nonsense. You never liked me, anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party! [from outside]
SpongeBob: Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!
Plankton: Never! Never! [laughs and SpongeBob walks out backwards. Squidward faints. SpongeBob crashes through Patrick's rock and reemerges with Patrick sleeping on his head. SpongeBob throws him off and he's pinned into the ground. SpongeBob walks toward the Krusty Krab. Inside SpongeBob] Toot toot! How about a little take-out?
SpongeBob: No! No, never! [he crashes through it, reemerging with a Krabby Patty. Plankton laughs evilly] You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty formula! [SpongeBob walks into the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!
SpongeBob: No, no, no! [they're inside and walk through a door] There's no one here.
Plankton: Don't remind me. Brace yourself, SpongeBob. This is my lab! [the room he's walked into has a screen with a live-action Labrador Retriever. The dog barks. They walk into the next room, a real lab] And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player? [He pulls it out again and it plays dramatic music. Plankton laughs]
SpongeBob: I must fight! [He mumbles nonsensically, stretches his head out, and bites against the side of the door. His body keeps trying to walk.]
Plankton: No, no, no, no. [He pushes the levers forward, which causes SpongeBob to lose grip and slam against the wall and wobble over to a giant funnel thing] There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it. [A robot arm clenching some seaweed comes in and drops it in the giant funnel analyzer. It has zapped and some beeping is heard from the giant computer screen. The screen, then reads what the computer says.]
Karen Plankton: Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed. [a picture of the seaweed appears]
Plankton: Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula. [laughs. pulls the lever forward, letting two of SpongeBob's fingers off the patty. He's holding it with both hands, so one finger from each hand] And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty. [two more fingers loose grip] This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants? [SpongeBob tries to resist, but stops]
SpongeBob: I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down. [His eyes fill up with tears and leak down his cheeks] I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, [One of his teary eyes twinkle] you delicate little Krabby Patty.
Plankton: Mmm...
SpongeBob: [tearing up even more] With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness. [inside, Plankton starts to get hungry]
Plankton: Steamy... [a live-action patty gets assembled on screen as SpongeBob states the ingredients]
SpongeBob: I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. [inside, Plankton starts to drool excessively]
Plankton: Yes... yes... yes! [he jumps out of one of SpongeBob's holes to the patty] Come to papa! [he bounces off the patty and lands in the analyzer] Oh, boy... [he is zapped and the computer reads out the analysis]
Karen: Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas. [Plankton appears on the screen]
Plankton: Well, this stinks.
SpongeBob: Well, patty, I guess we can go home now. [walks out]
Plankton: SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty! [SpongeBob walks out the swivel doors and they go back and forth] Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty! [the doors come to a close] Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries.


Squidward: Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created. [blows kiss] Congratulations, chef! [gets dressed, takes a shower, gargles, and brushes his teeth. He re-enters the scene in a tuxedo and sits down at the table. He hears laughter from outside. He goes to the window and notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with bubbles. SpongeBob whispers into a bubble and it floats over to Patrick and pops.]
SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick.
[Patrick giggles as he was about to blow a bubble. He eats the bubble and whispers into another bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob where it pops.]
Patrick Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward, now annoyed, notices a liquid coming from his soufflé, pours it into a bowl and starts rapidly stirring the liquid with a fork until it becomes bubbly. Meanwhile, outside, Spongebob whispers into another bubble]
SpongeBob: [whispering into bubble] Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
[The scene cuts to Squidward's back window as he finishes stirring the liquid, and blows a bubble with it through the fork. Squidward's bubble is approached by SpongeBob's bubble, grows a leg, and kicks SpongeBob's bubble, thus popping it. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops.]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.
[Patrick frowns and blows a bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [whispering into the bubble] Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. [the bubble floats over to Patrick and pops, followed by another bubble floating back over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly. [another bubble comes over and pops] Yellow is ugly! [two other bubbles, but smaller, float over and pops, both containing raspberry noises for SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [talks into the bubble, puzzled] Patrick, what are you talking about?
[The bubble floats over to Patrick. Another bubble of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you. [SpongeBob gasps] You give bottom dwellers a bad name.
[Squidward creates several other bubbles and they float over to SpongeBob]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!
[Squidward laughs. Another bubble floats over to Patrick]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!
Patrick: [stands up and yells at SpongeBob] Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
SpongeBob: [stands up and yells at Patrick] Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
Patrick: Right, you're a turkey!
SpongeBob: What's that? [Squidward arrives outside with a lawn chair and his soufflé]
Patrick: It's what you are!
[Squidward begins to laugh hysterically at SpongeBob and Patrick's arguing.]
SpongeBob: Well, you're a bigger one!
Patrick: Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You are!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! [he goes inside through the back door and turns around] Aww, tartar sauce! [shuts door]
[Patrick angrily opens his rock, which closes and comes up sounding like an accordion. ]
Squidward: [Laughs at Patrick. Puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth.] [Continues laughing. Moves his tentacles around in laughter, then lies back in laughter accidentally swallowing the fork and choking on it. Chokes on the fork repeatedly and his skin turns to a deep shade of blue as the letters "K" and "O" appear in his right eye and left eye respectively and flashes appear. Squidward passes out and drools]
Patrick: Wow, Squidward, you're choking! [runs over to Squidward] Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well. [he takes a deep breath and performs CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick catches it] I win!
Squidward: Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Patrick: I did?
Squidward: Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend! [shakes Patrick's hands]
Patrick: Friend? [holds Squidward] Friend...
Squidward: [uneasily] Yeah, Patrick, we're friends... [steps back] just friends. [they both notice SpongeBob is gazing from his window with a blank stare]
Patrick: So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? [walks with Squidward over to the Easter Island head]
Squidward: Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Patrick: Clarinet? I love music!
[inside the pineapple, SpongeBob watches the two go inside Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? [Gary is sleeping inside his shell] Gary? [knocks on his shell]
[cut to Squidward's]
Squidward: Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Patrick: [sitting on a bench while clapping] Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! [Squidward takes a deep breath and plays a note, and Patrick immediately falls asleep, to the annoyance of Squidward. Scene cuts to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! [he holds up three fingers] Uhh... [he draws faces on each finger with a broken smile] The gang's all here... [he looks at the faces on his fingers, and his eyes well with tears] Ohhh!
[Squidward is dragging Patrick, who is still asleep, outside. Suddenly, after a few feet, his back gives out]
Squidward: Ow! Oh! My back! I threw out my back!
SpongeBob: [sees Squidward in pain] Oh, boy, now's my chance! [jumps out of the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
SpongeBob: [running] Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
Squidward: No, no, no, get away from me!
SpongeBob: Hang on! I'll save you! [rips off his suit revealing a speedo underneath]
Squidward: [tries to get to his door] No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
SpongeBob: [jumps off a diving board] Hold on!
Squidward: No, no! Get away! [screams as SpongeBob dives into his back cracking it back into place] Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend! [SpongeBob smiles big]
SpongeBob: Friend...
Squidward: N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. [Squidward and SpongeBob walk into the Easter Island head] So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
Squidward: You play?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! [he takes one from the wall] Give me an A, buddy! [Squidward plays a note and SpongeBob sings] Squidward is my best friend in the world. [grates strings with bow] Squidward is my best friend in the sea...
[The bow flies into what looks like Squidward's head and he screams. Fortunately, it turns out it's just a painting; the real Squidward pulls the bow out and growls as he snaps it in half with his knee]
SpongeBob: [now playing with his fingers like a guitar] Squidward...
Patrick: [pops in through the window] Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob. [SpongeBob slams the window in Patrick's face] Oh!
SpongeBob: [strums harder before slamming the bass to the floor] And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer! [smashes the bass] Umm, I can fix this. [Squidward is steaming red in fury]
Squidward: Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! [he kicks SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
Squidward: Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. [opens up the curtain and screams after he sees Patrick in his tub]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. [shows him a brush and soap]
Squidward: Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on! [SpongeBob peeks in through the upstairs window]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? [notices Patrick in the bath-tub] Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... [shown bath toys] ...rubber bath toys!
Patrick: [simultaneously] Oh, yeah?! Well, he was my friend first!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously] You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of...
Squidward: [screams] This can't be happening to me! [He runs away. SpongeBob and Patrick stop their arguing as they notice Squidward's gone]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
SpongeBob: Buddy!
Patrick: Squidward, where are you?!
SpongeBob: Where'd ya go, friend?
Patrick: Where are ya, ol' buddy?
Squidward: [hiding in a trash can] Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and outta my hair!
SpongeBob: [reading a magazine as the doorbell rings a letter is pushed under the door. Then he smells it] Squidward. [opens it] A dinner party? I'd love to! [SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door and Squidward opens it] Did you miss me?
Squidward: Come on in! You look stunning. [shuts door]
SpongeBob: I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy... [gasps when he sees Patrick] Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac!
Patrick: Me neither! This was a setup!
Squidward: I thought you two were my best friends.
SpongeBob and Patrick: I am your best friend!
Squidward: [takes out a bottle of soda] Well, how about some soda, guys? [SpongeBob shows him his glass]
SpongeBob: Yes, please! [Squidward gives him some soda] Thanks, friend. [flicks Squidward's nose] [drinks]
Patrick: How about some for your best friend? [SpongeBob puts his glass in front of Patrick's, so he gets the soda instead of Patrick]
SpongeBob: Thanks, best friend! [drinks]
Patrick: Can I have some now, buddy?
SpongeBob: Wait, I need some more! [pours SpongeBob another glass]
Patrick: I still didn't get any! [SpongeBob gives Patrick his soda]
SpongeBob: There ya go. More please! [Squidward fills his glass as SpongeBob drinks it really fast]
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward! [shows Squidward his glass again, but it's still full] Squidward!
Squidward: Patrick! Your glass is full!
Patrick: Oh, yeah...
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both show Squidward their glasses] Squidward!
Squidward: Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more. [walks away] Why don't you just stay here and chat? [closes door. Then we see SpongeBob and Patrick. They are extremely fat and not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door with a grocery bag. Then an explosion and crashing sounds are heard] I should just walk away right now. [opens door to find his house destroyed] What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? [pieces around the door break]
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? [both hug]
Patrick: Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
Squidward: Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
Squidward: No! Out! [both walk out]
SpongeBob: Psst, I think he's jealous.
Patrick: How pathetic. [Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around as a bubble comes and pops on the door which causes the door to fall on his back]
Squidward: Ohhhhh, my back.


[SpongeBob's foghorn alarm goes off]
SpongeBob: This is it, Gary!
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed bounces up and flings SpongeBob onto the calendar, where he lands on March 3rd with the words "boating exam today!" on it then drops to the floor]
SpongeBob: The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable! [A door opens from underneath him. He comes out of his house riding a unicycle] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Squidward! [SpongeBob rides his unicycle around Squidward's house]
Squidward: Ready to move?
SpongeBob: No, I'm ready to pass my boating test. [Rides his unicycle towards the school] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [stops his unicycle near a dumpster and jumps off of it] I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore. [throws the unicycle into the dumpster] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!
Gus: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license!
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Hey, I'm getting mine next.
Gus: Hey, I doubt it. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [jumps around the boardwalk]
Mrs. Puff: [sighs] I'm not ready. [opens the door]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!
Mrs. Puff: [with clipboard and pen in hand] We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must...
SpongeBob: First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
Mrs. Puff: I know. Okay, #1: What is the front of the boat?
SpongeBob: The bow. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: What is the back?
SpongeBob: Stern. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: #3: Right is...
SpongeBob: Starboard. [answers the remaining questions] Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924! [Mrs. Puff writes down his answers]
Mrs. Puff: You've passed the oral test. What a surprise! [gets in the boat and secures herself tightly] Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat.
SpongeBob: Oh, in this boat right here? [looks at his watch] Is it time already?
Mrs. Puff: Get in the boat, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, absolutely. [gets in and closes eyes with a smile]
Mrs. Puff: All you have to do is get on the track.
[SpongeBob's eyes spring open in awe; he looks ahead to the track that gets longer and longer in delusion]
Mrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Mrs. Puff: No, no. First thing is to... start the boat. [Mrs. Puff turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat.
SpongeBob: The boat?
Mrs. Puff: Okay, now what do you do next?
SpongeBob: Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: Yes... no, no! Don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Floor it?!
Mrs. Puff: No, no, don't, don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Okay, floor it!!!
Mrs. Puff: No! No! [SpongeBob pushes the accelerator down and starts driving backwards really fast by some spectators and drives into a lighthouse] NO! NO!!!
SpongeBob: Floor it! [After crashing, Mrs. Puff inflates and becomes big and round with a deep voice]
Mrs. Puff: OOHHH, SpongeBob, WHYYYYY?
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: [in his bed at night] I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, thirty-eight. [puts his pillow on his head]
Gary: [puts on SpongeBob's boots] Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, I'm not walking.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie in SpongeBob's bed] SpongeBob, this is star ranger, over.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] What is it, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] I got a surprise for you.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Get out of bed. [SpongeBob gets out of bed]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, now what, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Go to your closet for a surprise. [SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, I'm at the closet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] I don't know, Patrick. [SpongeBob opens the closet door and Patrick has one of SpongeBob's SquarePants on]
Patrick: Patrick SquarePants!
SpongeBob: [deadpan] Pat, don't do that. [sits in a chair] I've got too much to worry about.
Patrick: What's the problem?
SpongeBob: I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: ...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers... [Patrick's square pants rip off] ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
Patrick: Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. [takes SpongeBob's walkie-talkie]
SpongeBob: How are we going to do that? [Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob's head with the antenna coming out of the top]
Patrick: Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. [SpongeBob notices the antenna sticking out] Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? [Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. Next, we see a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob's upstairs window]
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge. Testing, testing. [looking through the telescope at SpongeBob] Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing. Testing! [loudly] TESTING!!! [screams] TEST, TEST, DO YOU READ?!
SpongeBob: Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Got your apple ready? [SpongeBob shows an apple] Lucky undergarments? Hold on... hold on... [Patrick focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word lucky on the top of it] BINGO!!! Underwear, apple, and me! You're ready to get that license! Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff. Act natural. [SpongeBob jumps out of the boat and on the ground and starts chewing grass]
SpongeBob: Mooooooooo.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, get in the boat! [SpongeBob jumps in the boat. A siren is heard as Mrs. Puff comes out an ambulance and into the boat] Give her the apple. [SpongeBob gives her the apple]
SpongeBob: Here you go, ma'am. [Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows]
Mrs. Puff: Let's get this over with. [takes a deep breath] What's the first thing you do? [puts hands and arms over head for protection]
SpongeBob: Uhh...
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Start the boat. [SpongeBob pushes a button that starts the boat causing Mrs. Puff to go crazy]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Whoa-ho! Huh? What?
SpongeBob: It's okay, it's only the boat.
Mrs. Puff: The boat? You started the boat?
SpongeBob: I... I think so.
Mrs. Puff: Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, put it in drive.
SpongeBob: Put it in drive?
Mrs. Puff: Yes, yes, yes! [SpongeBob pushes lever down to drive] Put it in drive! Then what?
SpongeBob: [lifts leg up] Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: NO! AHH, NO!!!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] FREEZE, MISTER. [SpongeBob stops] BIG. TOE. [SpongeBob's big toe pops out of his shoe and gently pushes the accelerator down]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, gracious. Oh, gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, you're coming to your first turn. [giant wall with the word wall on it is shown and a left curve]
Mrs. Puff: Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Left! [SpongeBob turns left]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Right! [SpongeBob turns right]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Oh my, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine.
Montage: [SpongeBob stops at a stop sign and looks both ways before starting to drive again. Then drives around with his left arm out making a signal. Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of SquarePants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob's diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating out of SpongeBob's fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down.]
Mrs. Puff: Splendid! Wonderful! [sign that reads finish line is just ahead] There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head? [everyone laughs] Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? [everyone laughs] And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? [everyone laughs] Oh, yes, but that would be cheating. [SpongeBob opens his eyes wide realizing he is cheating]
Patrick: HAHA! CHEATING!!! [hysterically] HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!
SpongeBob: I'M CHEATING! Mrs Puff?!
Mrs. Puff: Yes, my star pupil?
SpongeBob: I think I'm cheating...
Mrs. Puff: What's that, dear? [SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff]
SpongeBob: I think I am cheating!
Mrs. Puff: You've... you've let go of the wheel.
SpongeBob: I do have an antenna under my hat! [shows antennae under hat] There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true! [crying] I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
Patrick: WHAT!?! [Patrick runs out of SpongeBob's house and back under his rock, crying]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!
Mrs. Puff: [packing] The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel...
SpongeBob: Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
Mrs. Puff: No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat that way!
SpongeBob: No... I'm cheating...!
Mrs. Puff: At least, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: I'm cheating!
Mrs. Puff: Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!
Mrs. Puff: It's okay to cheat today!
SpongeBob: No...!
Mrs. Puff: That way! Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: Cheater...! [crashes off screen into the lighthouse again, Mrs. Puff inflates again]
Mrs. Puff: [manly voice] OOHHH, SpongeBob, WHYYYYY?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: It's okay, SpongeBob, you didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. [EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester. [Mrs. Puff cries as she is taken away by the ambulance] It'll be great! [walks away] Only now I don't even have my bike.
Gary: [with SpongeBob's bike] Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile! [rides away on his bike with Gary on his head] Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!


Squidward: [The scene starts at the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob cleaning a table] Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home!
[phone rings]
SpongeBob: I got it, I got it! Coming! [leaps for the phone, but Squidward answers it first. SpongeBob falls to the floor and exclaims]
Squidward: Hello. Sorry, sir. We're close... [Mr. Krabs snatches phone]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there! Krusty Krab, how could I help you? [customer explains order over phone] Pizza? [eyes turn into dollar signs] Ummm... of course we have pizza!
Squidward: Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Our delivery squid will bring it right over. [hangs up]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza. [Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby patties and turns it into pizza. Then he puts it in a box] We don't deliver!
Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver. [gives Squidward the pizza] But you do.
Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
Mr. Krabs: Great idea! Take him with you. [SpongeBob sneaks over smiling big]
Squidward: That's not what I had in mind!
SpongeBob: Front end... check. Antenna... [touches the boat antenna making it vibrate] check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker... [bumper sticker says "I Brake For Sea Urchins"] ...check. [uncaps the tire pressure and puts his mouth in it, causing him to inflate like a balloon, and talk in a squeaky, high pitched voice while he is now the size of a giant parade balloon] Tire pressure! [blows out the rest of the pressure in Squidward's face, returning him to his normal size and voice] ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever!
Squidward: Good, then you drive.[tosses his hat away]
SpongeBob: I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner.
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, but...
Squidward: Just do what you do in school.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.
Squidward: Back it up.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Squidward: Back... it up.
SpongeBob: Right, back... it up. [tries to move the stick shift down]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay!
Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse! Right... uhh...?!?!?! [SpongeBob imagines the words "FORWARD" and "BACKWARD" turning into Korean characters, 앞으로가 (FORWARD) and 뒤로가 (BACKWARD)]
Squidward: BACK IT UP!
SpongeBob: [shifts gears] BACKING UP! BACKING UUUUPPPPP! [boat backs up really fast]
Squidward: [tries to get the wheel] GIVE ME THE WHEEL, SPONGEBOB! GIVE ME THE WHEEEEEEEEL!
SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up! [they go over a bumpy area with rocks and then they spin around and around and around, screaming. The next morning, the boat goes over five hills] Backing up! Backing up! Backing up! Backing up... [boat stops with no fuel left] ...backing up.
Squidward: Well, you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? [echoing] We're in the middle of nowhere!
SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.
Squidward: And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?! [kicks boat and the boat's gasoline becomes full again and it drives away into the distance without them]
SpongeBob: Well... we can still deliver it on foot. [Squidward narrows his eyes. Later, both walk on the sand]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: [singing] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
Squidward: ...and my feet are killing me. Whoa! [trips over SpongeBob, who is lying on the ground] SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: [rubbing the ground] It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is no time for...
SpongeBob: Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: [pointing to the road] Truck! Sixteen wheels! Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked. [starts dancing in the road while wearing a hat] WheeeeEEEEEeeee... eeeEEEEEeee... [Squidward sits on a rock while playing with a wooden spoon]
Truck Driver: Crashin', frashin' break dancers! [honks his truck]
Squidward: He's stopping, he's stopping! [Squidward realizes he's not stopping and grabs SpongeBob out of the way where they are covered in sand thanks to the truck. Squidward narrows his eyes at the smiling SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Squidward are now in a place with heavy winds] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza [The wind blows on Squidward's nose making it touch his face so he puts it down, only for it to touch his face again so he puts it in his mouth.] is the pizza free delivery! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. [SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds]
Squidward: Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!
SpongeBob: [still being carried around in the air] I can't, it's for the customer!
Squidward: Who cares about the customer?!
SpongeBob: I do!
Squidward: Well, I don't!
SpongeBob: [wind stops and SpongeBob gasps] Squidward! [starts flying again]
Squidward: Let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! [runs over Squidward]
Squidward: Ow. [holding SpongeBob's legs] SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! It's for the customer!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [notices a tornado in front of them] Let go of the pizza! [lifts up into the tornado]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [looks down] Hang onto the pizza! [tornado spits them both out. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground] Hey! Hey! [crawls up to the screen] Where's the road? Wh-wh-wh-where's the road?! [a tumbleweed rolls by] We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go??? [SpongeBob lands] What are we gonna do now!? There's no road here!
SpongeBob: I think town's this way. [points]
Squidward: Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
SpongeBob: That's right. [points to a mossy rock] Moss always points to civilization.
Squidward: That way? That way there? [SpongeBob nods] So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
SpongeBob: [nods again] Yep.
Squidward: Well, then I'm going this way. [heads the other way]
SpongeBob: Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
Squidward: Trust me, I know where I'm going. [Pans out to show another city in the other direction]
SpongeBob: [sings] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally. [later] pizza... [starts beatboxing] pizza... [later, SpongeBob is walking backwards. SpongeBob's pants almost split into two and move up and down simultaneously while he continues to beatbox. Still later] Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and [falsetto] me-eeeeee-eee-ee-eeeeeeeeeee!! [later] Krab Pizza... for you... Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside... [Later, they are both lying face down in the sand]
Squidward: Sponge, we gotta eat something.
SpongeBob: I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. [Squidward eats some coral] No, maybe it wasn't coral... [Squidward spits out the coral] ...maybe it was sand... no, no, mud.
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
Squidward: Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No, we promised it's for the customer.
Squidward: [fancy music plays] You're right. It's for the customer.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.
SpongeBob: Well?
Squidward: Just a peek. [opens box]
SpongeBob: [he shuts it quickly] Okay, it's fine!
Squidward: No, I think I saw something. [opens box] Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine-looking pizza.
SpongeBob: [entranced] Yeah...
Squidward: What's that? Is that the cheese?
SpongeBob: Yeah...
Squidward: And the pepperoni?
SpongeBob: Yeah...
Squidward: [SpongeBob slurps] Ooh, looks good, huh?
SpongeBob: [snaps out of it] ...wait a second! I know what you're trying to do, Squidward! [closes box] I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Get away!
Squidward: Get back here, SpongeBob! [chases SpongeBob] Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Wait! [he becomes too tired to run]
SpongeBob: No! No! [runs into Squidward]
Squidward: I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
SpongeBob: Look, we're saved!
Squidward: Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
SpongeBob: No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants]
Squidward: Will you cut that out?!
SpongeBob: [to a conga beat] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again. SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
Squidward: That's just a stupid boulder!
SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder!! [sniff] It's a rock! [cries] A ro-ha-hock! A ra-ha-ha-ha-HA-hock! It's a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae. And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks. Hold on there, Jethro!
SpongeBob: [they stop outside the customer's house] I can't wait to see the look on our customer's face! [rings doorbell]
Orange fish: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir, your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
Orange fish: Wow, thanks. I've been dyin' for one of these. It... [brief pause] Where's my drink?
SpongeBob: [confused] What drink?
Orange fish: [in an angry tone] My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink!
SpongeBob: [checks through the order] But... you didn't order any drink.
Orange fish: [yelling] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!?
SpongeBob: But... but... [tears start rolling down his face]
Orange fish: Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy? WELL, I AIN'T BUYIN'. [slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry]
Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay... Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [Squidward gets angry, grabs the pizza, stomps towards the customer's house and pounds on the door]
Orange fish: [answers the door, still angry] Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't PAYIN' FOR THAT.
Squidward: [Orange fish's point of view] Well, this one's ON THE HOUSE! [slams the pizza box in the orange fish's face]
SpongeBob: [still crying] Did he change his mind?
Squidward: [smugly] He sure did, ate the whole thing in one bite.
SpongeBob: [stops crying] No drink?
Squidward: Nope. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock]
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work! [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Work...? Oh, my aching tentacles...!


Nematodes: Walking, walking, walking, walking. [continue to repeat "walking"]
Nematode #1: Hungry!
Nematodes: Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry. [continue to repeat "hungry." All eat a whole large piece of coral]
Nematode #1: Still hungry!
Nematodes: Still hungry, still hungry, still hungry, still hungry. [continue to repeat "still hungry." All eat a truck that drives by, leaving the driver floating]
Fred: Naw, dang nematodes!
Nematode #1: Thirsty!
Nematodes: Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty. [continue to repeat "thirsty." They all bounce to SpongeBob's house and take out some straws. Then start drinking up the pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are still sleeping as everything begins to shrink inside, even Gary's food bowl]
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed begins to shrink as he wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no! [squeezes through the door as he tries to get to the phone. Gary gets stuck in the door]
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Ow. Shell phone! I know. I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do.
Squidward: [on the other line] Hello?
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
SpongeBob: [as he talks to Squidward, his voice gets higher and higher and starts talking faster until the shellphone completely disappears] Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller, The walls are closing in on me, Squidward, Gary is terrified too! [the phone call is disconnected] Oh no!
Squidward: Yep, it is. [SpongeBob screams]
Patrick: [comes out from his rock] Is it time already to ruin Squid's day? [falls off rock onto his furniture, then jumps out with a tuxedo and tophat on] Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!
Nematodes: [continue sucking on SpongeBob's house, then they all burp and leave]
SpongeBob: Ohh... nematodes. [sees a seed on the ground, then picks it up] The only thing left of my house is this little pebble. [Patrick and Squidward walk up]
Squidward: What's going on here?
SpongeBob: I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! [sadly] It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
Squidward: [smiling] Yeah...
Patrick: [his eyes bulge excessively in surprise] Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!
Squidward: Well, what can I say? [begins to shake SpongeBob's hand] It's been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else. [walks back to his house] [sarcastically talks] I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo. [party favors fly out Squidward's windows as he parties] Boo-hoo! [starts to laugh]
Patrick: Squid's taking it real hard. So what are you gonna do now?
SpongeBob: I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad. [shown a picture of SpongeBob's parents smiling]
Patrick: No, wait a minute, no you don't. [shown picture of SpongeBob's parents frowning] We can build you a new house!
SpongeBob: We can't build a house!
Patrick: Well, sure, it's easy! I built my house all by myself! [antenna on Patrick's rock falls off]
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, lets get to work! [zoom in on SpongeBob and Patrick as construction workers] 
Patrick: [Patrick tries to hit a nail into a board, but hits his hand instead] Ow! Ow! Ow! [SpongeBob takes two buckets of paint, one red and one green. He pours the red paint on his backside and pours the green paint on his front side. He puts one side on a fence so that the paint gets on it, and then he does the other side the same way. He does this twice. As he tightens a loose bolt, the screen turns every time SpongeBob tightens the bolt sending Patrick sliding, falling upside down towards the sky, then back onto the ground right side up. SpongeBob nails pieces of wooden boards together in midair, and a piece falls off and lands on Patrick's hand, leading him to say "Ow!" each time. Patrick moves his board under the next board, which falls down on his hand. This happens several times. Next, shown SpongeBob's finished house, shown also with sparkles]
Patrick: [Patrick gives a big thumbs up with bandages wrapped around his thumb] We're done!
SpongeBob: Yeah! So what do you think?
Patrick: [SpongeBob's built house sparkles a bit] I wish I lived there.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: No. [SpongeBob puts the small pineapple on his head]
SpongeBob: One bedroom. [nose sticks out through the door and the pineapple breaks into pieces]
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
SpongeBob: [pets Gary] Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
Patrick: Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
SpongeBob: That'd be great!
Patrick: Yeah! We'll be rockmates! [SpongeBob and Patrick get ready to sleep under Patrick's rock] Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, rockmate.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [SpongeBob goes to sleep but then is awaken to Patrick's snoring] Oh...what the...? [Gary hides in his shell and SpongeBob puts a cork in each side of his head, and goes back to sleep. The wind blows and Patrick shivers, he then pulls the rock closer to him, SpongeBob shivers in the cold and pulls it back over himself. Gary sits on top of the rock as they keep pulling it back and forth until Patrick keeps the rock closer to him. SpongeBob gets cold and he covers himself with sand on and goes to sleep. Patrick starts drooling heavily, filling his mouth, and flows like a stream over to SpongeBob. As SpongeBob snores, he absorbs the drool coming from Patrick and becomes a fat sponge. He waddles over to Patrick and removes the corks, spilling Patrick's drool out of him and down-sizing him to normal size. Then he takes out a bigger cork and puts it in Patrick's mouth and goes back to sleep. Patrick struggles, then spits out the cork]
Patrick: [in his sleep] Oh! A spiders! Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Get 'em off, off me! Off, off, off! [lifts rock and starts smashing SpongeBob with it several times, he then goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, wake up! No, wake up! No, it's me! I'm SpongeBob! [moves away from the rock a few feet and goes back to sleep]
Patrick: Spiders! Spiders! [picks up his rock, runs over to SpongeBob, and smashes him repeatedly with the rock] Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, oh, oh, ow, ow, ow, ow! [Patrick goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: [in Squidward's house, he stands next to Squidward, holding Gary, as Squidward sleeps, he taps Squidward's nose as he whispers] Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] H-h-huh?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] Whoa. Huh? Wha-what?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever.
SpongeBob: Thanks. Thanks, Squidward. [gets in bed with Squidward] Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, oh, yeah, sure. [scoots over to the side]
SpongeBob: While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
Squidward: [sleepily] Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure. [Sleepily talks a bit, gets out of bed and walks off, then comes back with a glass of water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here. [Squidward hands SpongeBob the glass] Thanks, buddy.
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome. [SpongeBob drinks the water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I like sleepovers.
Squidward: [sleepily] Yeah. Me, too.
SpongeBob: Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
Squidward: [yawns] Good night, SpongeBob. [Squidward's eyes pop open. Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Gary walk out] [unhappy] Good night, SpongeBob. [night turns to day then rooster crows to wake everyone up. Squidward opens his eyes excitedly] Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late! [he flies into his closet, gets dressed, and goes outside] Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand outside, with bags] I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
Squidward: Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob. [changes his smile to a frown briefly] Please.
SpongeBob: Here come my parents. [Patrick beings to cry and the car horn sounds as SpongeBob's parents drive up]
Mrs. SquarePants: SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we're here!
Mr. SquarePants: Come on, SpongeBob, hurry, hurry, son, your mother has dinner waiting.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mom.
Squidward: Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags. [picks up the bags and carries them to the car]
SpongeBob: Just give me a minute. [walks back to where his house used to be] I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. [buries it into the ground in the middle of where his house used to be] You hold too many memories. [as he starts to cry, a tear falls from his nose and into the ground where the seed absorbs it, it then starts to glow. Then SpongeBob shakes Squidward's hand] Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. [walks away]
Squidward: Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye. [dances] Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye. [Patrick lies on the ground, bawling, as SpongeBob gets in the car]
Mrs. Squarepants: Come on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. [Patrick holds onto the back of the boat, lifting the front into the air, as he cries]
Squidward: [still dancing] SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving! [the seed shakes violently] La, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha! [the seed shakes even more violently] He leaving, ha ha! [seed still shakes, then it sprouts three roots] SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving! [Suddenly, the ground starts shaking. Squidward stops dancing, while SpongeBob, his parents and Patrick stare, bemused. A giant green stem grows out of the ground, SpongeBob's house grows from the plant and drops where his old house used to be and on Squidward. The stem then goes back into the ground]
SpongeBob: My house is back! [SpongeBob, his parents, and Patrick all happily run into the pineapple] Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be! [continues praising all of the returned belongings he possessed in his original house. SpongeBob returns to Squidward lying under the floor] Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
Squidward: [muffled] Forever?

TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Fleet and forceful. With the ability to assemble and charge the creatures of the deep.
Mermaid Man: By the power of Neptune!
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man, with his young associate Barnacle Boy, fights for all creatures who live in the sea, against the forces of evil.
Villain: [holds a baby's lollipop and he spots the whirlpool] Oh, no! The Raging Whirlpool! [the whirlpool catches him and the lollipop falls on the baby's tongue]
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man! Champion of the deep.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! Champion of the deep! Woo!
SpongeBob: [dressed up as Mermaid Man] Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
Patrick: [dressed up as Barnacle Boy] Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man! I'm right behind you!
[SpongeBob and Patrick outside and sneak behind Squidward, who's relaxing on a lounge chair wearing sunglasses.]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good.
Squidward: [takes off glasses to notice the twosome, then puts it back on] Fun, fun.
SpongeBob: You know what this means... [pulls out a box of donuts]
Patrick: Donuts!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oohhh...
SpongeBob: [using a donut like a ring] By the power of Neptune! [Patrick bites into the donut]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, UNITE!
SpongeBob: Creatures of the deep, assemble! [both go into deep thinking] Think... harder... Barnacle Boy... [jellyfish swims by] Here they come! [Squidward blows jellyfish away]
SpongeBob: Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful.
Squidward: [under a tent] What the? Ohh!
SpongeBob: If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak.
Patrick: Jumping jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!
[Cut to Squidward destroying the tent in a fury]
SpongeBob: Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave.
Patrick: Right, Mermaid Man.
Squidward: SpongeBob! [chases after SpongeBob and Patrick, who run inside; Squidward runs up to the door and he knocks it hard] SpongeBob, open up!
SpongeBob: [Squidward continues knocking the door] Reflecto has found our secret lab.
Patrick: What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask him yourself?
SpongeBob: Elaborate, you vile fiend!
Squidward: He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
SpongeBob: Hmm, they must be working undercover.
Squidward: Yeah... now please leave me alone.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick bites into the donut again] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, reunite! [At Shady Shoals Retirement Home]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?
Manager: Undercover? Yeah... well, I'll see if they can take time from their busy schedule to see you. [SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing as they walk in] There they are. Right over there. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
Manager: Try not to surprise them.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Can you believe it?
Patrick: [holding onto SpongeBob] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk in front of the TV]
Barnacle Boy: Hey, who are those guys?
Mermaid Man: Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?
Barnacle Boy: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: Well, we used to be. But now we're retired.
SpongeBob: [shocked] But you can't retire. There's evil afoot!
Mermaid Man: Wha?! Evil! EEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIILLLL!!! [hanging on a coral pot] Barnacle Boy! Come quick! I've got the evil!
SpongeBob: All I said was, "there's evil afoot."
Mermaid Man: EVIL! EVIL! E...
Barnacle Boy: Would you please stop saying that?
Mermaid Man: [hanging on a water fountain] EVIL! Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil! [water squirts at him] Death raaaaay! [the manager comes, grabs SpongeBob and Patrick and throws them out]
SpongeBob: Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Patrick: It's too bad they're old.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. [real life captain gives a thumbs up and triumphant music plays] The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement! [fireworks appear]
Patrick: Oohhh! Pretty lights!
[At Shady Shoals Retirement Home's cafeteria]
Mermaid Man: To the meatloaf! [Receives a slice of meatloaf into his bowl] To the broccoli! [Receives some broccoli into his bowl. Mermaid Man looks at the cafeterian.] Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
Cafeterian: Here you go, son. Haha.
Mermaid Man: To the table, awaaaay!
Barnacle Boy: Careful! Don't run!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
Barnacle Boy: What do you want from us?
SpongeBob: Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
Mermaid Man: Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
Barnacle Boy: Will you cut... will you stop calling me "boy"?
SpongeBob: Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. [jumps onto one of the cafeteria tables where somebody is eating] And he globs onto the undersea dome. [puts his mouth on the table] And he starts sucking on the glass. [an old fish moves his oatmeal away from SpongeBob in disgust]
Barnacle Boy: What's your point, kid?
SpongeBob: You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
Mermaid Man: Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
Manager: [enters the cafeteria] What is going on in here?!
Mermaid Man: [points to SpongeBob, who stops smiling] You may kiss the bride! [SpongeBob gets kicked out and rolls home]
Patrick: Did you re-unite our heroes?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm married. [Back at the retirement home]
Mermaid Man: [he and Barnacle Boy are in rocking chairs] Up, up, and awaaaay. Up, up, and awaaaay.
SpongeBob: [dressed up as a woman and speaking in a Southern accent] Oh, myah. This purse is so big and heavy.
Patrick: [dressed up as a robber] Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that! [grabs SpongeBob's purse]
SpongeBob: AHHHH! Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp! [Barnacle Boy stomps over to him]
Patrick: [peaking from a building] It's working!
SpongeBob: [to Barnacle Boy] Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
Barnacle Boy: [yells at SpongeBob, ruining his makeup] Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
SpongeBob: [approaches Mermaid Man, who is sleeping with his eyes open] Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open!
Barnacle Boy: Confound it, get away from him!
Mermaid Man: [wakes up] STOP SHOUTIN'! I'M NAPPIN!
Barnacle Boy: [close up to his face] It's not me, you ol' coot!
Retired Elderly #1: Yes.
Retired Elderly #2: That's me.
Retired Elderly #3: I'm over here!
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: What do you want?
Barnacle Boy: This better be good.
SpongeBob: This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile! [The invisible boatmobile is shown almost completely covered in black paint and we also see Patrick smiling while holding a paintbrush with black paint on it.]
Barnacle Boy: GAH! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: EVIL! ...Where is it!?
Barnacle Boy: There it is! [points at SpongeBob and Patrick] You know what this means!? [opens up a box with shiny rings]
Mermaid Man: Donuts!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, brother.
[Barnacle Boy puts the ring on Mermaid Man and then they try to put both of the rings together, but they miss. Superhero sequence fails. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy wave their arms around up and down to synchronize their positioning of their arms. So then they attempt to unite both of the rings together a second time. Both rings are successfully put together but the superhero sequence fails again.]
Barnacle Boy: Say the oath.
Mermaid Man: [in his young voice] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite! [unite sequence succeeds while their rings are united together] Throw a waterball at 'em!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Waterballs! Waterballs! [Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob, but nothing happens]
Patrick: Hehehehehe...
Barnacle Boy: Mumbling morays. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Dogpaddle away! [they swim around SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: It's the Raging Whirlpoo!. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer as the whirlpool consumes them]
Mermaid Man: Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
Barnacle Boy: Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Sea creatures, unite! [they summon the sea creatures, but they are retired, so they come slowly]
Barnacle Boy: Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
Mermaid Man: Sea creatures! ATTACK!!!
SpongeBob: Pinch me, I must be dreaming. [sea creatures, now carrying torches and pitchforks, pick up SpongeBob and Patrick] Mission accomplished, Patrick!
Patrick: Yeah, we did it! [sea creatures throw them out]
Mermaid Man: I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
Barnacle Boy: We did it, you ol' coot. [they shake hands]
Mermaid Man: [confused] Who are you? [Barnacle Boy becomes annoyed]
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy play checkers.]
[Mermaid Man places a black checker on the board. A "Pow!" pow-bubble appears. Barnacle Boy replies by placing a red checker on the board. "Clack!" appears. Mermaid Man sweats, then places a black checker to the end of the board. A "King Me!" appears. Suddenly the phone rings.]
Mermaid Man: It's the Aquaphone! [he holds the phone upside down] What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello?! [Hangs up phone. "HANG UP!" appears] The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed. ["SIT!" appears]
Barnacle Boy: Remind you of what?
Mermaid Man: Remind me of what?
TV Announcer: Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
SpongeBob: Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Patrick: It's all thanks to you. [SpongeBob gives us a thumbs-up and winks; "WINK!" appears]



Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Clay: Hmmm... uhh... oh, I'll have a... [Squidward takes out a pencil and a paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Maybe... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and  the paper away] Hmmm... I'll have... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. Or maybe...
Squidward: Are you planning on ordering today, sir?
Clay: I'll have a Krabby Patty. [Squidward writes down order]
Squidward: How original.
Clay: And with extra onions.
Squidward: Daring today, aren't we? [takes order and shows SpongeBob] One Krabby Patty, extra onions. [SpongeBob takes piece of paper and puts with the rest of the orders]
SpongeBob: One cryin' Johnny comin' up! [cracks knuckles; adds each ingredient as mentioned] First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! [bell rings]
Squidward: Whatever. [John comes up and tells Squidward what he wants and Squidward relays order to SpongeBob] Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! [SpongeBob takes a plate and patties begin to appear on the plate]
SpongeBob: [at rapid speed] Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! [Squidward takes the plate]
Squidward: Thanks, Farmer Brown. [gives the plate to John] It's been a thrill serving you.
John: Can I get some extra salt?
Squidward: We're all out.
John: Could you check?
Squidward: No. [John glares at Squidward as he leaves. Bubble Bass walks up to order] Let me guess, tiny, a small salad?
Bubble Bass: I'll take a Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim. [Squidward gives up writing all of that down]
Squidward: We serve food here, sir. [SpongeBob shows Squidward he has already gotten the order done]
SpongeBob: I got it already, Squidward. [gasps] Bubble Bass!
Bubble Bass: [pushes Squidward away] SquarePants! [walks to SpongeBob] I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [staring at Bubble Bass] Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
Bubble Bass: Yep.
SpongeBob: Well then... here ya go! [Bubble Bass takes the plate and sits down where he examines the Krabby Patty until he decides to take a bite] Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
Bubble Bass: This is pretty good. Only one thing. You forgot the pickles! [shows no pickles on the patty]
Crowd: [gasp]
SpongeBob: No!
Bubble Bass: The best there is? I don't think so. You lose! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [checks patty for pickles] But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! [customers are disappointed; tears the patty apart, finding the pickles] Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? [Bubble Bass walks up to Mr. Krabs, but also throws Squidward out of the way again]
Bubble Bass: I believe you owe me two bucks.
Mr. Krabs: Two bucks?!
Bubble Bass: Your guarantee. [points to the menu where in tiny print it says 'money-back guarantee']
Mr. Krabs: Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this? [takes out two dollars and Bubble Bass grabs it]
Bubble Bass: No.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls money back] How about a discount on restroom tokens? [Bubble Bass takes money back]
Bubble Bass: Afraid not.
Mr. Krabs: How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it! [Bubble Bass walks out the Krusty Krab with the money] No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No! [walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck! [SpongeBob tries to hang onto the floor]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait! [Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!
Squidward: I need a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right! [starts a new patty] Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No! [tries again] Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go? [tries again and uses the same bun] Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it! [tries again] Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no! [Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? What? [SpongeBob walks out and goes home]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... [looks up and notices door is not there] The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing! [Mr. Krabs opens door a couple feet away] Oh. [laughs] Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain. [walks out] Uhh, which way do I live? [Mr. Krabs points the path] Of course. [laughs. Later, we see SpongeBob in his house trying to write down the formula] No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe? [throws paper and pencil away] I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight. [at night]
SpongeBob: Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or... [hits his head with his fist] D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow. [gets in between the two mattresses] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Aw, this isn't right. [he slips out and stands upside-down on his bed] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Wait, this isn't right either. [SpongeBob lays down on his back] Nope. [SpongeBob is between each railing of the ladder] Nuh-uh. [tries sleeping with a mattress on his head] Negative. [tries sleeping on the ground next to his mattresses] C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. [tries in the lifesaver] Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet! [keeps doing the wrong things as the clock fast-forwards to morning and the rooster crows where the alarm goes off. SpongeBob is under all three mattresses on the floor] Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! [picks up Gary and shoves him in the foghorn alarm where it is still going off. At The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [there is black smoke coming from kitchen. Squidward clears the smoke off with a fire extinguisher] Patties are done. [Mr. Krabs notices black, burnt patties and gets irritated]
Mr. Krabs: Urrgh! [Turns backwards from the counter after hearing customers starting to complain]
Unknown Anchovy: Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty.
Martha: He burnt my fries!
Billy: [Briefly drinks his burnt shake until realizing it is burnt.] He burnt my shake!
All customers: [all yelling and mumbling]
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!
[cuts to SpongeBob's house, he nailed a toaster to the door]
Mr. Krabs: [opens door] SpongeBob?
[music playing in reverse; the house is a total disaster as everything is misplaced and things are everywhere and opposite.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [now he has underwear on his head] Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?
Mr. Krabs: Why you talkin' funny, lad? [takes the underwear off SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: I anything can't do right since because pickles.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
SpongeBob: I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: But you're fine, me boy! [SpongeBob walks right through the wooden kitchen door] Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not. [walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is nailing a piece of bread to the table] All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: I how do that?
Mr. Krabs: It's like riding a bike. You never forget! [notices a bike in a boiling pot of water on the stove] Uhh... I'm gonna help ya! [shown both of them sitting on the ground in SpongeBob's living room] If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. [takes out a blanket with all the ingredients on it]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...
Mr. Krabs: Take your time. [SpongeBob thinks of the Krabby Patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. [Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping until SpongeBob wakes him up] I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!
Mr. Krabs: Don't talk like that!
SpongeBob: Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! [Makes patty as he tells Mr. Krabs the ingredients] I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! [notices the Krabby Patty he just made, was in the correct order]
Mr. Krabs: It's time.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rescued Squidward from the burning kitchen and extinguishes him, too.]
Unnamed fish: Hey, SpongeBob's back! [men and women are cheering]
Bubble Bass: I hear SquarePants is back! [SpongeBob opens the kitchen door]
SpongeBob: I'm right here, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: I thought I ran you out of town. [spits a loogie into a bucket]
SpongeBob: This is where I belong! [holds up bubbles and blows one] .
Bubble Bass:  [Gives a weird sounding roar]
SpongeBob: Rawr.
[The crowd gasps. SpongeBob and Bubble Bass glare at each other, while Mr. Krabs is sweating with anticipation]
Bubble Bass: Give me the regular. And this time, don't forget the pickles.
SpongeBob: [rushes into the kitchen and comes back with a Krabby Patty in the blink of an eye] I didn't.
[Mr. Krabs is violently sweating as Bubble Bass examines and eats the patty]
Bubble Bass: Hmm... ...Still no pickles! [SpongeBob notices] See? [sticks out his tongue with all the chewed up food on it. Everyone is getting sick at the sight of it and they’re disgusted] You failed again, SpongeBob LoserPants! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [looks at Bubble Bass's mouth] Wait a minute! [grabs Bubble Bass' tongue and pulls it out] Look! [shows four pickles under Bubble Bass' tongue] He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
Mr. Krabs: And there's the pickles from last time, too!
Shubie: And there's my car keys! [everyone walks up to Bubble Bass, all glaring at him]
Bubble Bass: And... there's my ride! [runs out the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Whoop-de-doo.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward! [Squidward smiles] Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Squidward is shocked and frowns. The frown becomes more droopier with each "Boo"]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Scene changes to outside of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
Customer: Boo! You stink!


Narrator: Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.
Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! [SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air] Let's see here. This weeks hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... [gasps] [shaking nervously]...SpongeBob...! [SpongeBob moves his desk between two rows] It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor.
Jimmy: Mrs. Puff, I've done it already! [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Ohh... Phil?
Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor.
Tina: Hey, I've done it three times already! [SpongeBob moves up closer]
Mrs. Puff: B...uh...B-Beth!
Student: She graduated!
Mrs. Puff: Henry?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Vera?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Clayton?! [SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs] Alright, I guess I have no choice. [gulps] The hall monitor of the day is [she sighs] SpongeBob. [SpongeBob launches into the air]
SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
Mrs. Puff: Okay! Just take the hat and belt. [tries handing him uniform]
SpongeBob: I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech.
Mrs. Puff: You can't make this easy, can you?
SpongeBob: Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Give me a break.
SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... [clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech] ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! [at this point almost everyone, is asleep] Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. [takes out a long roll of paper] "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears." [the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk] In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform [takes out the hat and belt] and assume my duties as... [puts on the uniform] ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! [walks towards the door then turns around] Oh, and I will be re... [bell rings as all students run over SpongeBob]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob: I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
Mrs. Puff: I'm afraid so.
SpongeBob: Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. [takes off his uniform] I hardly knew ya. [gives uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
SpongeBob: A-hoo! [dives into the uniform] Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I've just done? [cut to SpongeBob walking down the street, singing somewhat incomprehensibly. Then notices a broken traffic light]
SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! [directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures, but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end] What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
Fred: My leg! My leg!
SpongeBob: On patrol. I'm on patrol. [notices a house with an open window] Uh-oh, an open window. [peeks through the window and there is a couple eating]
Vera: More seaweed medley, dear?
SpongeBob: The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. [jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask, screaming as he does so] I'm the open window maniac! [both run out screaming] I hope you learned a valuable lesson! [shuts the window and begins walking again] On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... [gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground] Vandals! Another crime. [takes his finger and tastes the pink goo] hmm...strawberry! I must act! [more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick eating some strawberry ice cream] Patrick... [looks around for the voice he just heard] Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick: My ice cream! It's alive! [screams and throws away the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here!
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. [ice cream cone is on SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Patrick. Come down here. [Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'm down here.
Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That's hall monitor to you!
Patrick: Sorry, officer.
SpongeBob: Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
Patrick: What crime? [shows him the ice cream that is on the ground] I'm a bad person! [cries]
Newspaper Boy: [High Voice] Extra! Extra! "Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!" City paralyzed with fear! [gives one to SpongeBob] [Gruff Voice] Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. [runs off] [High voice again] Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob: [reads paper] "Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
Patrick: [still crying] I wanna be good!
SpongeBob: Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. [Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head] Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
Patrick: Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! [both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream]
SpongeBob: Okay, now what?
Patrick: Hmmm... [both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream]
SpongeBob: This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! [takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick grabs one and is elated with joy] And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! [SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick]
Officer Rob: Afternoon, son.
Patrick: Hello, brothers. [salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his cone hat]
Officer Rob: Son, we're looking for the maniac.
Officer John: Have you seen this man?! [He whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.]
Patrick: [screams] It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away!
Officer Rob: Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy. Understand?
Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh.
Officer Rob: Okay. [Officer John shows Patrick the poster again]
Patrick: [screams] Horrible!
[Officer John removes the poster, bemused. He holds up the poster again. Patrick screams again. Both cops then look at each other and smile slyly. Officer John repeatedly shows and takes away the poster as Patrick screams every single time. Eventually, the cops decide they've had enough fun.]
Officer Rob: Stay indoors, son.
Officer John: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. [both laugh as they drive off]
Patrick: [takes out walkie-talkie] SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!
SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared!
SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie, sobbing] I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
Patrick: Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting... [the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark] ...dark.
SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
Patrick: Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. [Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob, but Patrick doesn't realize it] [gasps loudly] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Where is he, Patrick?
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] At the intersection of Conch and Coral. [SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign]
SpongeBob: That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
Patrick: Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly! [screams over walkie-talkie] Get out of there, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams] That's his maniac shriek! He's going to attack! [SpongeBob cries while running around in circles] He's acting all crazy! Run! Hind behind that building! [SpongeBob hides behind the building] No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign! [SpongeBob hides behind the street sign] No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light! [SpongeBob gets under the street lights] No wait, agh, he's there, too! Run for your life! [SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out]
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Say again, deputy?
Patrick: The maniac's in the mailbox! [SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox. He alternates between screaming and crazily jabbering as he runs through three buildings, causing them to topple over and eventually crashes through a fence plasted with wanted posters]
SpongeBob: [takes a look at a wanted poster] Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! [Patrick screams in the background and a mass of police cars surround SpongeBob]
Officer Durado: We'll take that as a confession. [Mrs. Puff appears]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself! [SpongeBob slumps sadly at these words]
Officer #1: You know this guy?
Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility. [the cops glare at her] Uh-oh... [at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV] And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [frowns nervously] Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I'd like to see you after class. Six months from now! [jail closure sound]


SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy! [While knocking on her door, a spaceship comes up from underneath the ground at the left side of the tree dome] Wow! [Sandy peeks her head out of a spaceship window]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around.
SpongeBob: [Sandy rides an elevator on the bottom floor and meets SpongeBob downstairs] Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
Sandy: [pointing to a poster of the moon] I'm goin' to the moon, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: The moon! Can I go?
Sandy: No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird. [shown a graveyard of dead animals] Besides, there's not enough room for you.
SpongeBob: But I don't take up that much space! [squishes himself into a little square] See? [downsizes himself to fit into a little drawer] I can fit in here. [closes the drawer] Mmm, cozy.
Sandy: I need that drawer.
SpongeBob: Well, how about... [jumps into a test tube] This? [jumps into another test tube] Or this? [jumps into another test tube] Or this?
Sandy: SpongeBob, this isn't for fun. [shows her clipboard with math equations on it] See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways. [SpongeBob is behind a set of bars]
SpongeBob: Fine. [deep voice] Put me in the brig, I don't mind!
Sandy: That's the air vent, SpongeBob. [pushes a button to turn the air vent on that blows SpongeBob out of it] I need that, too.
SpongeBob: Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
Sandy: All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...
SpongeBob: [running around the ship] YEAH!!! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride, moon ride, moon ride!
Sandy: [grabs SpongeBob] But this time, just don't touch anything, okay? [Cuts to Sandy pumping a gun and SpongeBob comes to watch her]
SpongeBob: Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
Sandy: Aww, hush, silly. [shoots her gun and 3 gray nets cover a couple items] This is for harvesting moon rocks.
SpongeBob: Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
Sandy: Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores? [walks around and forms a circle around him and Sandy with his shoes] And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night? [sees a circle] Ah! There's one now!
Sandy: SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave your crazy alien notions behind.
SpongeBob: [trying to sleep. Checks the clock every few seconds] Oh, hurry up! [grabs two clothes pins and puts them on his eyelids] These oughta do the trick.
Patrick: [Sitting in the window] Hi ya, SpongeBob! [clothes pins shoot off his eyes]
SpongeBob: What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?
Patrick: Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.
SpongeBob: A present?
Patrick: No. Uh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?
SpongeBob: There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
Patrick: [shows a spray can] Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!
SpongeBob: Alien repellent? Let me see that. [looks at the can] New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the rocket]
Patrick: Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: It's pretty impressive, all right.
Patrick: Come on! [both head for the rocket]
SpongeBob: We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
Patrick: Wow. How do you think we get inside? [pulls a level that says "open"]
SpongeBob: We don't, we're just spraying the... [door opens on SpongeBob] ...windows.
Patrick: I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on! [both walk inside] Holy sea cow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
SpongeBob: Yeah, just don't touch anything. [Patrick starts playing with everything]
Patrick: Look, I'm winning!
SpongeBob: Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun... [SpongeBob turns around and looks at himself as thin in the mirror] ...house?
Patrick: WOO-HOO! WINNER! YEAH! HIGH SCORE!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
Patrick: I don't know! [notices a lever above his head] But let's see what this does!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think we should... [Patrick pulls a lever and the two launch off the seat out of the rocket]
Patrick: I like rockets. [both fall back into the rocket]
Patrick: More! More!
SpongeBob: No more! [Patrick presses a button and both shake a lot then stop] Okay, one more. [shake again] Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
Patrick: Hey, I think this one starts it! [SpongeBob stops Patrick from pushing a button]
SpongeBob: Stop, Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here. And I happen to know that that particular button is riiight over here. [presses the engine button and the ship starts up and is blasting off]
Patrick: You started the rocket!
Sandy: [wakes up and notices the smoke] ...Awwwww, Spongebob... [SpongeBob and Patrick hold onto each other while the ship is taking off]
Patrick: Hold on, buddy! [while screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick are falling down to the bottom of the ship. The ship enters space and both of them start to float] Hey, we stopped falling!
SpongeBob: Look! [points at the dark galaxy] We're in space now! Wee! [both float around in the ship]
Patrick: Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something! [SpongeBob laughs as the ship is going around the moon] Hey, SpongeBob, watch this! [squirts toothpaste into some peanut butter]
SpongeBob: Hey, you got your toothpaste in my peanut butter! [SpongeBob lifts a heavy weight on one finger] Patrick, I can do this! [the ship is landing back into the sea and the heavy weight hurls into the ground and flattens SpongeBob's hand]
Patrick: Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
SpongeBob: We must be landing.
Patrick: All right! [Sandy uses her jetpack to fly up to the moon]
Sandy: Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts. [the ship is now in Bikini Bottom. While Sandy searches for SpongeBob and Patrick on the moon, these two get out of the ship]
Patrick: Wow, it sure looks a lot like home. [Patrick sees Gary asleep] Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
SpongeBob: Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
Patrick: So you mean to say they’ve taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we’ve been thinking our thoughts we think we thought?! I think?
SpongeBob: Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it! [SpongeBob captures Gary with a gray net-like substance] Yeah!
Patrick: You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.
SpongeBob: Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me! [grabs Gary] Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier! [tosses Gary into the ship. Ship's number increases from 00 to 01; ding from "The Price Is Right"]
Patrick: Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
SpongeBob: Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them. "Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to!" [whispering to Patrick] Make sure your gun is pumped. [go in and see Squidward sleeping] Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting. [Squidward moves his arms and legs around then puts them back down. He mutters incomprehensibly and says, "Grandma"] It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis. [SpongeBob takes the covers off. Squidward is wearing a pink floral top]
Patrick: Wait! What's THAT? [SpongeBob takes a red bag out from underneath Squidward. It appears to be a hot water bottle] I think I'm gonna be sick.
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
Patrick: Stinky.
SpongeBob: No. It's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo. [Patrick puts flashlight under the so-called "egg sack" and SpongeBob's hands are under it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Twins! [Squidward rolls over in his sleep and his right tentacle sticks on Patrick's helmet]
Patrick: Pardon my French, but get this thing off me! [SpongeBob and Patrick try to get his tentacles off but they wake him up instead]
Squidward: Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
Patrick: It's awake!
SpongeBob: Let's capture the little phony! [Squidward screams]
Squidward: Get away from me! [runs away while SpongeBob and Patrick try to capture him. Outside, Mr. Krabs walks up with his pet worm and notices Squidward's house shaking. SpongeBob and Patrick come out with Squidward captured]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye? [laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick point their guns at his head] Wait! Don't shoot! Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!
SpongeBob: We don't want your money... moon man! [both capture Mr. Krabs and toss him and Squidward into the ship] Look at them squirming around in there.
Patrick: Eww, gross.
SpongeBob: Well, there's plenty more where those came from. [at Boating School]
Mrs. Puff: [grading some of her students' paper] SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late? [captured] Whatever this is... [inflates herself and has a deep voice] ...it's going on your permanent record! [Flats, Shubie, and Larry are captured along with all of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick are run out of room in the ship for everyone]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.
SpongeBob: There's no time for that! Just push harder. [Sandy is on her jetpack floating down]
Sandy: SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of... [SpongeBob and Patrick capture her]
SpongeBob: Nice try, Sandy.
Patrick: Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. Hahaha!
Sandy: Aliens? Is that what this is about? [SpongeBob and Patrick throw her into the ship] This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot-- [door is slammed shut]
SpongeBob: It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone. [both stare at each other and pump their guns] So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!
Patrick: I didn't even know!
SpongeBob: Yeah? Well, I got you now.
Patrick: Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's... [Patrick catches himself with the gray netting as it turns out he had his gun pointed the wrong way] ...me that's got me!
SpongeBob: Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face! [ship runs out of gas and stops on the moon] Sandy, I'm back! [peeks out the window] Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different. [sees the Earth and realizes his mistake] Uh-oh...
Everyone else: SpongeBob, we "aliens" would like a word with you!


Mr. Krabs: [dancing and singing at Pearl's birthday party] ♪Yar-har, Pearl's my daughter, I'll spit in your eye! Yo-ho, Pearl's a whale, and it's her birthday, yar-yar-yar!♪ Ta-da!
Pearl: Thanks for the show, Dad. Now can we open the presents?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. Here ya are. [places the present in front of Pearl]
Pearl: Oh, you shouldn't have. What is it, Daddy? It wouldn't be those totally hip new flipper slippers all my friends are wearing, would it? Everyone wants them.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...they might be.
Pearl: Whee! [begins to unwrap present] Oh, you shouldn't have, yay, you shouldn't have. [sees present] I mean, Dad, [holds up big boots] you really shouldn't have! [Pearl's friends laugh]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!
Pearl: Dad, you ruined me! [cries]
Mr. Krabs: But I got them for a bargain! [the house shakes from Pearl's screaming and wailing. Bubble transitions to the Krusty Krab] Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I'm stuck with them!
SpongeBob: [peeks into Mr. Krabs' office] Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots. [SpongeBob sits down, but the boots are in his way, so he can't see Mr. Krabs] So you want to get paid?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots [leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other] are in [leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other] the way.
Mr. Krabs: [pushes the boots aside] In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
Mr. Krabs: Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.
SpongeBob: ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable. [takes boots away]
SpongeBob: Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: Paycheck! You got a deal--
SpongeBob: And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
Mr. Krabs: You've got a deal.
SpongeBob: And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
Mr. Krabs: You got a...
SpongeBob: And... [Mr. Krabs stops SpongeBob from saying anything else]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, lad! You're gonna give me a heart attack! [shakes SpongeBob's hand] You got yourself a deal.
[Squidward is drying off a glass when he looks through the glass and sees SpongeBob wearing boots]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!
[SpongeBob bounces up and down in the boots, making them squeak, as Squidward watches. Then SpongeBob bounces harder until Squidward's head is bouncing up and down really hard trying to keep up. Then SpongeBob leaves to squeak his boots around the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music.
[Later that night, Mr. Krabs is in his room, lying in his hammock and imagining dollar bills jumping one-by-one into a cash register]
Mr. Krabs: [muttering] Money, money, money, money, money. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty... [all of a sudden, the pair of squeaky boots jumps into the register. He opens his eyes] Wha? Who's there? [rests his head on his pillow] Back to countin' me money. [closes his eyes again and imagines coins jumping into the register] One, two, three, four, five... [the boots appear again; Mr. Krabs opens his eyes again] What the barnacle is that? [he sees that the bedroom window is opening and shutting by itself, making squeaky noises. Mr. Krabs closes the window and gets back into bed, but notices the window has opened again. He walks back across the room to close it but steps into a hole and falls out the window, breaking the tip of his leg off in the process. He gets back into his bedroom, watches his step to avoid another hole and shuts the window, but it won't close. He starts shutting it with increasing force and speed until the window finally stays closed. The window reopens again, and Mr. Krabs gives it the "evil eye" followed by a growl. The window immediately closes back, as if it says "Yipe!" Mr. Krabs then starts to go back to bed, but he steps into the same hole he avoided earlier and breaks the tip of his other leg off. He screams as he gets flung into his hammock and gets all twisted up in it. Mr. Krabs can do nothing but lie there with bloodshot eyes as the window makes squeaky noises all night, as if it is clapping at him. Fade to the next morning; Mr. Krabs has his legs bandaged up as he drowsily walks to the Krusty Krab] Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work. [As he walks up to the door, Squidward slams the doors open into Mr. Krabs' face]
Squidward: That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now.
Mr. Krabs: [muffled] What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?
Squidward: I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week. [leaves the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob. [every time SpongeBob's boots squeak, Mr. Krabs stutters. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, but he is so tall, all Mr. Krabs can see is his boots]
Mr. Krabs: I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots.
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this? [runs in place fast with plates of Krabby Patties in each hand]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh...
SpongeBob: Or could he do this? [leans over to one table and sets the plate on the table without having to move from his spot at all] Or this? [leans to another table and puts a plate of patties on that table, then goes behind the register on top of the boat] And watch this, Mr. Krabs! [moves his boots around slightly, making them "talk"]
Squeaky Boots: May I take your order?
Francis: Yeah, I'll have the Krusty Special.
Squeaky Boots: Thank you, sir. I will squeak when it's ready.
SpongeBob: Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I, uhh...
SpongeBob: And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this. [does many different things with his boots until Mr. Krabs can't take it anymore]
Mr. Krabs: [his eyes go bloodshot] [screaming] I gotta go to my office! [puts seat cushions over his ears] I can still hear it! [puts chairs over his ears] It's still coming through! The infernal squeak! [he repeatedly bangs his head on his desk] Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin.
[that night, at SpongeBob's pineapple...]
SpongeBob: Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off.
Gary: [puts earplugs in] Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary.
[as SpongeBob is sleeping with his boots on, Mr. Krabs peeks over his diving board and climbs down, then takes his boots off and runs to the Krusty Krab, laughing quietly. Some hammering sounds are heard, then a rooster crows as night fades to morning]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quiet money. Silence and money. [SpongeBob bursts through the double doors]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What is it, my boy?
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs while crying] Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, son.
SpongeBob: [cries harder and looks up at his boss with tears streaming down his face] No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Mr. Krabs: Hold it, boy! It's not the end of the world.
SpongeBob: Yes, it is!
Mr. Krabs: Look, don't cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts! [holds up some oven mitts]
SpongeBob: [puts them on his feet, waits a second, then kicks them off] They're not the same! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots. [walks into the door, opens it, then goes into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Poor lad. [looks through the window and sees that SpongeBob is so upset, he has his head down... right on top of the hot grill]
Tom: Excuse me?
Mr. Krabs: I didn't do it! [sees Tom] Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?
Tom: Yeah, I'm ready to order.
Mr. Krabs: [takes out a notepad] What'll ya have?
Tom: I'll take a [squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: [becomes surprised] What did you say?
Tom: I said, I'll take a [squeak].
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob: [still in tears] I heard his order, Mr. Krabs. He says he wants [squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: What?
Tom: And a [squeak squeak squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [starts going insane, imagining everything and everyone squeaking] Huh? [looks at the menu and sees "squeak" as an item for everything] I didn't write that! [keeps thinking and hearing the squeaks. Even the dripping kitchen sink makes squeaking sounds instead of dripping sounds. Eventually he starts seeing visions of SpongeBob and his boots.]
SpongeBob: [in Mr. Krabs' head] Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?... And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this... [Mr. Krabs' eye starts swirling]
Mr. Krabs: [snaps] Stop it! [the customers look at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] Stop... it! [his eyes start contorting] Oh, oh, don't you hear it?! Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboards! [sobbing] Oh, please, make it stop! It's the squeaking of the hideous boots! [throws himself onto the floor and bawls] I'm sorry! But I can't take the infernal squeakin' no more! [lifts up the Krusty Krab and grabs the boots, with everyone screaming inside. He then walks into the kitchen with an evil expression on his face and puts the boots into a vat of grease, which shrinks them, and he eats them. After that, he opens the door to the dining room, and lets out a long burp] The deed is done.
SpongeBob: Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.
SpongeBob: You really think so, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I do, son. [hands SpongeBob a stack of money] Here's the paycheck I owe you. [puts another stack of money on top of the first stack] Plus a bonus! [walks away] I need a vacation.
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!
[fade to Mr. Krabs and Pearl taking a drive out to somewhere, with a camper behind their boat]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.
Pearl: [lifts her feet over the side of the door to reveal her new shoes] Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Darling, I won't. [as he laughs, he hiccups and the squeaky noise comes out] Oh, no. [continues to hiccup and squeak as they drive off into the distance]


[SpongeBob is grilling Krabby Patties in the Krusty Krab kitchen until one of them suddenly levitates up from the grill and turns into a jellyfish. It floats out the window as the rest of the patties turn into jellyfish and do the same. SpongeBob follows them and flies out the window and turns into a jellyfish. He buzzes around Jellyfish Fields when he hears Mr. Krabs voice.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? SpongeBob! [the grill is on fire] Wake up, boy! You're burning me money! [SpongeBob wakes up from his dream and screams. Then runs behind Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what do we do?
Mr. Krabs: Here, use this! [Hands SpongeBob a fire extinguisher. SpongeBob throws it at the grill and sets the fire larger than before. Mr. Krab looks at SpongeBob for his stupidity, as he realizes his error. SpongeBob then tries to blow on the fire to put it out until a fireman comes into the kitchen with a hose and sprays SpongeBob with the water. SpongeBob enlarges and falls backwards, which puts out the fire]
Mr. Krabs and Fireman: Hooray! [SpongeBob shrinks and burns into a black sponge while Mr. Krabs scrapes him off the grill and on to a spatula]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come into me office. [in Mr. Krabs office] What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: Well, I.
Mr. Krabs: This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something.
SpongeBob: Well, I've been thinking.
Mr. Krabs: We need to get you thinking about work. [stretches his eyes out]
SpongeBob: No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. [Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat. [shows kitchen] This is your wide open range. [shows grill] These are your amber waves. [shows greasy fryers] And this[picks up a spatula from the sink]oh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's gone] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [walks out the Krusty Krab] I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles! [throws his hat on the ground]
Mr. Krabs: [opens doors] SpongeBob, wait! [sees SpongeBob's hat on the ground and screams] Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back. [SpongeBob is now giving his stuff away to his friends]
SpongeBob: And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener. [gives it to him]
Squidward: And I thought this friendship would never pay off. [walks away]
Patrick: [teary-eyed] Are-are-are-are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?
SpongeBob: It's all yours. [Patrick holds up a bunch of phone books]
Patrick: A-a-and these old phone books?
SpongeBob: All yours, old friend. [walks off and comes back with a case] Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have. [opens up a rectangular box that has the words "Ol' Reliable" on the front. A glowing jellyfish net is inside. Patrick throws the phone books away and picks up Ol' Reliable]
Patrick: Ol' Reliable? [cries as Sandy walks up]
Sandy: Howdy, y'all. Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?
SpongeBob: No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.
Sandy: SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright. [SpongeBob pats Sandy's helmet]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy. [walks away] Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye. [walks behind a bush and takes his pants off] I won't be needing these. [drops pants and runs away] Buzz, buzz, buzz.
Squidward: He took off his pants.
Sandy: I'll give him a week. [walks away]
Squidward: I'll give him eleven minutes. [walks away, throwing off the can opener at Patrick]
Patrick: Patrick sad! [at Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: [touches Jellyfish Fields sign] I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home! [jellyfish knock SpongeBob down as they fly by] Brothers and sisters, wait for me! [jellyfish fly into a hive] Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Okay, I'm here! [jellyfish fly out of hive] Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go... [sticks his finger in his mouth and then in his head] ...that way. [points to where the jellyfish went] Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. [running after jellyfish all over the fields. Jellyfish devour a bunch of kelp. SpongeBob decides to try it but is disgusted and spits it out from his tongue] This is the life. [jellyfish are floating in the middle of the fields as SpongeBob walks into the middle of the group] Hey, everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz? [wants to shake a jellyfish's hand] Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are? [jellyfish stings him and his hand, causing it to start swelling] Uhh... nice to meet you. [hand gets huge and swollen. SpongeBob smells some aroma and goes to check and see that Patrick and Sandy are having a picnic with Krabby Patties]
Sandy: "Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!" [whispers into Patrick's ear] There he is, Patrick. Say your line!
Patrick: [reading off script] "Why, thank you, Sandy, I would love one. [take patty.]" [takes patty] "Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home. [take bite.]" [sniffles. tries to take a bite, but throws the patty and the script away and turns to SpongeBob] I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not coming home.
Patrick: I miss you! [cuts to Sandy waving hello, but in guilt  manner because of set-up] Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you! [Squidward is throwing himself a party at home]
SpongeBob: I'm happy here. This is my home now. [Sandy drags Patrick away]
Patrick: No! SpongeBob! [later, SpongeBob comes in wiggling his arms and legs like the jellyfish]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this. [jellyfish float away as the net is swung at SpongeBob, which knocks him down. Patrick, breathing heavily,  is ready to capture SpongeBob with Ol' Reliable] Patrick! What are you doing?
Patrick: If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy! [shows a jar with a label on the front that says SpongeBob - Friend] I even picked out this nice jar for you!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now! [Patrick swings the net at SpongeBob but SpongeBob runs away. Patrick goes after him. SpongeBob hides behind a snail's shell, but the snail slithers off. SpongeBob goes to hide behind a rock]
Patrick: I can see you there! [SpongeBob hides behind a bush] I still see you! [SpongeBob hides behind another rock] You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs under neath an “N” shaped rock and peeks around. Patrick is underneath the rock on the top] I got you now, SpongeBob! [falls on the ground and misses SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick! No! [Patrick runs after SpongeBob again as SpongeBob jumps into the jellyfish hive. Patrick tries to get the hive down with the net, but he can't reach it. He vainly tries to jump to reach the hive, to no avail.]
Patrick: Okay! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy! [snaps the net in half over his knee and walks away, sobbing]
SpongeBob: Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters. [a drop of jelly lands on SpongeBob nose. He samples it] Mmm, jelly. [eats a lot of jelly as the jellyfish come back toward the hive] Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning. [jellyfish buzz into the hive] Greetings, comrades! [the jellyfish repeatedly shock SpongeBob and he screams. SpongeBob climbs out of the hive and runs as the jellyfish keep shocking him. Later, SpongeBob is in a cave] Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz. [rips off a bushel of grass] Buzz. [pushes rock over as he uses it for his pillow] Buzz. [pushes the rock aside and gets cold. The blanket scrunches up, but SpongeBob pushes it back down. Blanket scrunches up again and SpongeBob gets cold] Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy! [takes off the blanket and reveals 9 poison sea urchins] Ah! Poison sea urchins! [screams and scratches the urchins off of him and runs out of the cave] Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches. [crawls on the ground to stop the itching. Later, SpongeBob is walking home] Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. [buzzes fourteen more times as he walks up to the Krusty Krab door and sees a plate full of Krabby Patties on a table] Krabby Patties. [walks past Sandy's treedome, then he sniffles] Sandy. [still buzzing, walks up to his pineapple] What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. [opens the door and turns the light on. Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Squidward, Patrick, and Gary are there to welcome him home]
All: Welcome home, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty. [hands him a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do. [eats it as Mr. Krabs places his Krusty Crew hat on his head]
Mr. Krabs: And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning.
SpongeBob: [salutes] Aye, aye, captain!
Squidward: SpongeBob, do us all a favor. [hands SpongeBob his pants]
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do. [puts on his pants] Ta-da. [hugs Squidward] Aww.
Squidward: Okay, that's enough. [everyone else hugs SpongeBob and Squidward]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Can we please stop this? [everyone stops hugging]
Patrick: Patrick itchy! [everyone but SpongeBob starts to scratch themselves and crawl on the floor]
SpongeBob: It is great to be home!


[No customers are at the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs is holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, Squidward is reading a ballet magazine and imagining his head on the dancers, and SpongeBob is wiping dust off tables.]
[Closer shot of Mr. Krabs holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, attempting to retain his smile. Piece of paper flies through the open door of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?! [Squidward is dancing] Squidward!
Squidward: Uh-uh... Yes, sir?
Mr. Krabs: There's gonna be some changes around here. [Francis walks in. Mr. Krabs gasps] A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab! [runs up to Francis with a chair and seats him. Brings him back to the table] SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up.
SpongeBob: Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?
Francis: All I wanted was change for the payphone. [shows the dollar]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir! [runs off quickly and comes back with change. Talking in a French accent] Monsieur's change. [snaps his fingers]
Francis: Thanks. [laughs nervously and leaves a penny on the table] Here you go. [runs off as Mr. Krabs smells the penny]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah! [jumps on it. Later, Mr. Krabs' puts the penny away in his safe in his office and is with Squidward and SpongeBob] Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month. [pulls down a chart with zig-zag lines going down and his eyes sticking out on each side] We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers. [pulls the chart up] Do you lubbers have any ideas?
SpongeBob: I've got one! [takes out a tray with a soda and a pair of socks on it] A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams... [talks with mouth full of clams] ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment. [Squidward gasps]
Squidward: That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me! [runs up to Mr. Krabs with stars in his eyes] This is the moment I've... [eyes return to normal] I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.
Mr. Krabs: The money? [Squidward is lying on the table]
Squidward: And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs looks at his picture of him and Pearl] Little Pearly... a star?
SpongeBob: Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks! [runs off as Squidward and Mr. Krabs shake hands]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you've got a deal. Make my little girl a star! [later, the restaurant is being redecorated for the show. Squidward is writing notes on a notepad.]
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, what time am I going on?
Squidward: Going on what?
SpongeBob: The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!
Squidward: What talent could you possibly possess? [SpongeBob blows a big bubble which turns into a hippo. Then blows two small bubbles for the hat and cane. Both dance]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! [Squidward yawns]
Squidward: No one, not even your parents, would want to see that. [hippo bubble pops] What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.
SpongeBob: Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!
Squidward: I can hardly wait. [SpongeBob runs off] Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes. [laughs] Tennis shoes. I crack myself up. [now the night of the talent show where people are outside conducting interviews and people inside are talking and getting set-up]
Lisa: [Talking in the background] We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town...
SpongeBob: [peeks out from behind the curtain] Wow! A full house! [gasps] There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud! [Mr. Krabs shakes Mr. SquarePants' hand]
Mr Krabs: Hello, I'm Mr. Krabs, and I like money.
SpongeBob: I gotta get ready! [Squidward gets everyone's attention]
Squidward: Alright, people, listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop. [performers gather around] Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it's not. It's mine.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squid! How about this for the show? [runs off and runs back with a tub full of water and the words 'Mister Absorbency' written on the front] The Amazing Mister Absorbency! [puts his finger in the water and absorbs it. Absorbs the water into his legs] Ta-da! [absorbs water into his head] Ta-da!
Squidward: No one is going to watch you engorge yourself. [grabs Squidward's legs]
SpongeBob: Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!
Squidward: So you really want to be in the show?
SpongeBob: Oh, yes!
Squidward: Okay, you get to mop up afterwards. [hands SpongeBob a mop] Now will you stop bugging me? [walks off]
SpongeBob: So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! [show starts and crowd applauds. Squidward comes out and gets the cue cards that are in his tuxedo]
Squidward: Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home. [Patrick laughs] Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well. [Patrick laughs again] Put your fins together for... [Patrick cracks up laughing very hard. Bashes on the table with laughter, shaking dinnerware. He falls off his chair] Put your... [Patrick laughs] Put... [Patrick laughs] Pearl. [crowd claps as curtain rises for Pearl, dressed in cheerleader uniform]
Mr. Krabs: Hooray! My little girl is finally a star.
Pearl: Give me a K-R-U! [jumps up and down on the stage causing the crowd to fly up and down with her] Give me a S-T-Y! [jumps up and down again] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down]
Mr. Krabs: [He, Patrick, and SpongeBob's parents get tossed up and down. Mr. Krabs appear happy.] That's what I call talent! [Krusty Krab floor is destroyed]
Pearl: Thank you!
Fred: My leg! Ugh!
Pearl: Thank you, thank you! [Squidward closes curtain and as he is lowering the rope, SpongeBob is tied to it holding a mop and a bucket of water.]
Squidward: [Screams in shock]
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, listen. What do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side. [Squidward lets the rope go and sends SpongeBob flying up. Then he walks back out on the stage]
Squidward: And now, poetry. [walks backstage but peeks his head through the curtain] By Gary. [curtain opens. Gary is on a stool]
Gary: [clears throat] Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
Sandy: He has such a way with words.
Squidward: [checks his watch] Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me! [SpongeBob walks up]
SpongeBob: Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?
Squidward: Yes. [audience applauds as curtain opens, revealing Plankton in a magician costume and a sign that says 'The Amazing Plankton!']
Plankton: I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation... [turns his wand into flowers] ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes. [throw the flowers aside] First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience. [jumps onto a table and grabs the Krabby Patty from the customer. Runs toward the door, but Mr. Krabs stops Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Nice try. Your act's over, bub. [grabs the patty]
Plankton: You may win this time. She-hah-kazing! [he claps his hands and ignites into a mini-explosion. The smoke from the explosion clears and he is completely charred] Well, this stinks. [he walks off and is booed. Mr. Krabs runs up to Squidward backstage, leaving a trail of flames]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! [Literally races towards him, like an overspeeding race car] This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!
Squidward: Now, now, don't you worry, Mr. Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.
Mr. Krabs: For your sake, I hope you're right. [bunch of spot lights gleam around Krusty Krab]
Squidward: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward! ['Squidward Live' words blink in pink and green lights. Curtain opens and the background shows a canyon. Squidward dances with birds, accompanied by classical music. Then the lights go dark and music becomes techno as Squidward dances weirdly. Makes weird noises as he dances after the first part of his dance.]
Fish: What the?!
[Squidward continues to dance weirdly. Crowd boos and pelts tomatoes at Squidward]
Mr Krabs: I'm losing money on this deal! [puts a $1.00 sticker over the free sign on the salad bar. Grins.]
Fred: It's worth every penny. [everyone runs up to Mr. Krabs with dollar bills in hand]
Squidward: You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!
Crowd: No talent! No talent! No talent! [curtain closes]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, can I go on now?
Squidward: Yeah, show's over! [crown continues booing as SpongeBob walks out and mops up the tomatoes. Crowd gets interested in this and applauds at him]
Crowd: Hey, yeah. That's really not bad. I like that. Alright! [SpongeBob briefly stops mopping and the crowd becomes silent. He then starts mopping faster getting even more applause. He then leaves stage right and the applause stops. He peeks from where he left and mops the floor while leaving stage left which starts the applause again. He waves goodbye to the crowd] We want more! We want more! We want more! We want—
Squidward: They want an encore! [pushes SpongeBob away] Stand aside, SpongeBob! [Squidward jumps out and the crowd grows silent. He goes backstage and SpongeBob comes back out mopping and crowd cheers again. SpongeBob leaves stage left as Squidward jumps out again and the crowd instantly becomes silent again. Squidward is angry.]
[Squidward goes backstage and grabs SpongeBob. Then shows the crowd SpongeBob and they cheer. Then he puts his own head through the curtain and the crowd goes silent.]
[SpongeBob's arm gets a cheer, but Squidward's does not. SpongeBob's leg is shown then curtain rises and SpongeBob is mopping. Curtain closes then opens to reveal Squidward mopping and the crowd goes silent.]
[Squidward stops and he is angry. He tries to mop somewhere else to impress them. He then raises his hands up in a ta-da moment, but someone in the crowd throws a tomato and SpongeBob sweeps it up as the crowd cheers. Backstage, Harold and Margaret SquarePants bring Mr. Krabs up in a wheelbarrow full of cash.]
Mr. Krabs: You did it, Squidward! What a great show!
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, my son's a star!
Mr. SquarePants: Who ever knew he had such talent.
Mr. Krabs: I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show! [crowd throws flowers at SpongeBob]


Narrator: Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties. [lights go off and sirens and red lights blare as everyone in the Krusty Krab screams and runs for cover] Huh?! What's this? [doors and windows are now metal]
Mr. Krabs: Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: [up in a crows nest with a telescope] Down there, sir! [a Krabby Patty is bouncing to the door]
Narrator: [gasps] There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress! [Krabby Patty shoots a laser hole big enough for it to go through at the door] There can only be one culprit: Plankton!
Plankton: Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win! [laughs]
Squidward: He got away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: [devastated] No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!
Narrator: Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's... [SpongeBob tears himself into another SpongeBob and flies off] ...SpongeBob SquarePants! [later, SpongeBob peeks out through under the sewer with binoculars in his hand. Catches a peek at a Krabby Patty jumping through the crowd]
SpongeBob: A-ha! [chases it behind some buildings] Hey! [Plankton flies up with a propeller. SpongeBob takes the twirling club that the cop is using as a propeller and flies after the Krabby Patty to the top of a building] Okay, that's far enough! Huh? [patty jumps off building] Tartar sauce! [uses his hat as a balloon-like ball and jumps off the building. Bounces off the ground towards the Krabby Patty. Bounces past a cowboy and a cowgirl]
Cowboy: Yeehaw! [Plankton walks into a magic shop and comes back out with funny glasses on]
SpongeBob: Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and... [looks up and reads the sign MAGIC SHOP] Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, "If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true." [Plankton takes away Krabby Patty]
Plankton: Argh! I can't take it!
SpongeBob: Plankton! It's you!
Plankton: Yes! And after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser. [cries]
SpongeBob: Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
Plankton: [stops crying] Wh-what did you say?
SpongeBob: I said, you're a-- [a bunch of people run up and point at Plankton]
All: Loser! [Plankton jumps away from group and walks back to his restaurant]
Squidward: How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!
Policeman: Yeah, and for running you out, we're going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day. [puts a big donut with a ribbon on it around SpongeBob]
Squidward, Mr. Krabs, the policeman, Fred, Tammy, Joe, Millie, Ricardo, and Stella: ♪For he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie...♪
[Everyone throws SpongeBob into the air.]
SpongeBob: [thinking to himself] I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.
All: [as SpongeBob comes down, they stop singing] Which no... whatever. [everyone walks away. Later, Plankton hears a knock on his door at his restaurant]
Plankton: A customer? [opens door] Our special today is chum... [sees SpongeBob at the door] ...balaya.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?
SpongeBob: No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Play with me.
Plankton: You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?
SpongeBob: No, but I like to go jelly... [Plankton closes the door]
Plankton: That naïve cube! How long must I suffer this?
Karen: You're not letting him leave, are you? Can't you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!
Plankton: Elaborate. [computer shows images of a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob]
Karen: Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Take the Krabby Patty? [runs back to the door]
Karen: Get moving, genius, don't let him get away.
SpongeBob: [Plankton opens the door]  ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.
Plankton: Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.
SpongeBob: Great! [SpongeBob grabs Plankton and runs off] Last one to the fields is a rotten clam! [now at Jellyfish Fields] So, I get the big net and you get the little net. [hands Plankton a net bigger than him]
Plankton: What happens after we eat 'em?
SpongeBob: You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this! [captures a jellyfish] Like that.
Plankton: And?
SpongeBob: And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!
Plankton: Stingers? [Plankton imagines ruling Bikini Bottom with a jellyfish that only he controls] All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win! [end of fantasy while laughing]
SpongeBob: It's not about winning, it's about fun!
Plankton: What's that?
SpongeBob: Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...
SpongeBob: What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪
Clams: ♪Down here in the deep blue sea.♪
Plankton: ♪F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-♪
SpongeBob: Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪
Plankton: Never! That's completely idiotic!
SpongeBob: Here, let me help you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.♪ Try it!
Plankton: ♪N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪
Clams: ♪Down here in the deep blue sea!♪
Plankton: Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?
SpongeBob: No! That's how you're suppose to feel!
Plankton: Well, I like it. Let's do it again!
SpongeBob: Okay!
SpongeBob and Plankton: ♪F is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, chewing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha!♪
[At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is looking through a telescope at SpongeBob and Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, mutiny.
[At the Chum Bucket at night, Plankton is changing clothes.]
Plankton: And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...
Karen: Sounds like fun.
Plankton: Well, the really fun part was when we...
Karen: What did you do with the Krabby Patty?
Plankton: The what? [shows a Krabby Patty on Karen's computer screen]
Karen: The Krabby Patty, remember?
Plankton: You can't rush these things, you know.
Karen: You're forgetting about the mission! [shows a formula]
Plankton: What are you talking about?
Karen: You're going native, Plankton! Look at yourself! [metal arm picks up Plankton and shows him wearing square pants like SpongeBob's]
Plankton: What?
[cuts to Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.
SpongeBob: Who knows? Maybe he's changed.
Mr. Krabs: Who knows? I think you knows! [shows a picture of him and Plankton holding up the letters for FUN]
SpongeBob: He's changed, I tell you! [Plankton enters]
Plankton: SpongeBuddy! Yoo-hoo! [SpongeBob runs over to Plankton]
SpongeBob: Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private. [talking to Plankton] You won't mind if I set this here, will you? [puts a plate with a Krabby Patty on the table and pushes it toward him]
SpongeBob: What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...
SpongeBob: Why can't you just accept our friendship?
Mr. Krabs: He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you. [walks up to Plankton] Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.
Plankton: Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... suit yourself. [walks off then comes back to push the plate closer to Plankton. Uses a fan to get the smell to Plankton]
SpongeBob: We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs! [turns the fan off] Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here. [both walk away]
Mr. Krabs: Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight. [plate falls down revealing that it was cardboard] And maybe scallops will fly out of my pants! [takes the boat and paddles to the movies] Hang on there, laddie, I'm a-comin! [at the movies, SpongeBob and Plankton are sitting in the front row. SpongeBob is giving popcorn to Plankton as he is eating some himself. Then Bubble Bass comes down and sits on Plankton, squishing him]
SpongeBob: I sure like sequels, Plankton. [sees Bubble Bass in his spot] Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend. [Bubble Bass meanly smiles and gets comfortable in his seat, and a squelching sound comes from Plankton being squashed by his butt] Hey, Bubble Bass! [throws some popcorn and Bubble Bass runs after it]
Plankton: Thanks for that, friend.
SpongeBob: Sure thing.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up! [Mr. Krabs' shadow is on the movie screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? [in the projector room]
Mr. Krabs: He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got! [the ladies didn't understand, so they reach in their husbands pockets and take out a watch, some money and a piggy bank then run off] You too, boy! [SpongeBob reaches into Plankton's pocket and takes out a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I can't believe this!
Plankton: It's not what you think.
SpongeBob: What is it then? Tell me what you see here!
Plankton: I... I don't see anything.
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] How can you not see it!? [groans]
Plankton: [beginning to tear up as well] Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay? I couldn't help it.
SpongeBob: But we sang The F.U.N. Song! [clutches his stomach] I think I'm gonna be sick. How long?
Plankton: How long what?
SpongeBob: [grabs Plankton, holding him in his fist] How long were you planning on doing this?! [tears well up in SpongeBob's eyes] Tell me!
[Plankton puts his head down and begins to sob.]
SpongeBob: [the tears now dripping down his face] What?!
Plankton: [looks up at SpongeBob] All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship! [the two look each other in the eyes] And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!
SpongeBob: [sniffs, then smiles, beginning to stop crying] Really?
Plankton: [Plankton grabs the patty and jumps towards the screen] No, not really. Being evil is too much fun! [laughs evilly]
Movie Woman: Oh, darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart. [Plankton rips through the movie screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.
Mr Krabs: Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what’s behind these screens? Solid concrete! [laughs. Plankton is squished on the wall groaning. Mr. Krabs takes the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.
Mr. Krabs: Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Well, maybe on a discount. [Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the wall and onto Bubble Bass' jelly beans]
Plankton: Huh? [Plankton runs around Bubble Bass' hand getting chased by his other hand, being mistaken for a jelly bean]


[In SpongeBob's house, he is looking at himself in the mirror trying to look strong]
SpongeBob: It's time to grow myself large and wide.
[He grows himself large and wide as he is saying it. Walks over to his weight, which is a pink bunny and a blue bear and has trouble lifting it, but manages to get it over his head anyway. The doorbell rings and SpongeBob opens door]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?
SpongeBob: Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumpin' iron. Check it out. [shows off his muscles, but is still a weakling]
Sandy: Well, you're smelly.
SpongeBob: All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. [shows all sorts of stuffed animals]
Sandy: Uhh... I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob, but you won't see any progress with those.
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Sandy: That is, if you want arms like these... [rolls up right sleeve, and flexes her right arm, showing off a big, impressive bicep] ...or these... [rolls up other sleeve and flexes left arm, revealing her other bicep] ...or these! [shows off her powerful back muscles while executing a back double bicep flex. SpongeBob's arm wiggles in the air]
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.
Sandy: Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? That'd be great, Sandy. I can see me now. [imagines himself with muscles and very tall working at the Krusty Krab, then he is jellyfishing at Jellyfish Fields] La-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la. [at night, SpongeBob seems too big for his bed] Goodnight, Gary.
Gary: Meow. [cut back to the present]
SpongeBob: Yeah... that would change everything!
Sandy: Be at my place at 5 a.m. Oh! And you'll need a water helmet. [puts a fish bowl on his head. Now the scene cuts to Sandy's tree dome, where SpongeBob is trying to do push-ups] Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups! Come on. Come on! You can do it! [SpongeBob is grunting at this point determined to get a push-up. His body cracks and falls down while his arms stay up]
SpongeBob: One. [acorn bell dings]
Sandy: [in boxing ring with gloves on] Alright, put 'em up!
SpongeBob: [struggles getting his gloves up] They're up.
Sandy: Ding ding! [punches SpongeBob out of the ring. Later, Sandy starts up her exercise wheel with SpongeBob on it. SpongeBob pants while the wheel goes faster and makes him trip all over the wheel] Feeling the burn?
SpongeBob: I'm! Fee!! Ling!!! Some!!!! Thing!!!!! [launches out of the wheel and into the tree dome glass]
Sandy: Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm-cruncher.
SpongeBob: Arm-cruncher, great... [looks over and sees two cement blocks slamming into the cement pedestal] This squirrel's trying to kill me.
Sandy: [walks up to the arm-cruncher with phone in hand] This is it.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's great, Sandy, well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye. [hangs up] This working-out thing, isn't working out. [arms bulge in and out] Ow. Ow. Ow.
Shark: [on TV] Hey! Hey, you! Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! "Oh, I'm a little peanut worm." Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Shark: With Anchor arms! [puts a long pink blow-up item on his arm] They slip on like a glove. Just add air. [puts a plug in the arm's hole and pumps air into it] How big do you want 'em? [pumps air into other arm] Normal? [puts more air into arm] Veiny!? And for the ladies... [puts air into arm which makes it grow hair] ...hairy. [SpongeBob whistles as the TV puts up an image of a weak shark] I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk, and everybody loves me! So order now, wimp!
SpongeBob: Wow, now that's a good idea!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone! [later, a big shadow of SpongeBob is walking down the road past Squidward, who is licking a popsicle] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [Tongue stuck to popsicle while looking up.] SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: [Next scene is Mr. Krabs sweeping the outside of the Krusty Krab. He looks up.] Huh!?
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!!
Mr. Krabs: Mother of pearl! [hides in the Krusty Krab. Now, at Mussel Beach where everyone is lifting weights. SpongeBob comes in and makes one guy drop a big weight on two others' feet]
Fish: Owww...
SpongeBob: Hi, guys. [shows off new muscles]
Larry: SpongeBob, is that you!?
SpongeBob: [walking on his hands] Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait... wait... [flexes those muscles] They're big, aren't they?
Larry: Dude, you're ripped!
SpongeBob: [flexes out the words...] THANK YOU. I've been working out. Excuse me a second. [flexes more] Yeah. Anyone up for the... [flexes muscles into drinks] ...juice bar? [bubble transition to juice bar]
Scooter: I'm tellin' ya, he's huge!
Sandy: Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?
Scooter: You mean 'MuscleBob BuffPants'? He's in there! [points to inside of bar]
Sandy: Uhh, whatever. Thanks.
SpongeBob: [now inside]I start off with twenty raw eggs everyday. But that's just me.
Sandy: Pardon me.
SpongeBob: Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there! [points to weak fish]
Fish: Who, me? [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: I remember when I used to look like you, too. [points to Larry and laughs] But, that was a long time ago.
Bartender: Here's your drink, sir.
SpongeBob: Thank you. [tries to lift up drink but can't so he stretches his mouth out to the straw and drinks] Yeah...
Sandy: SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?
SpongeBob: I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results. [anchor arm almost slips off] Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better.
Sandy: Heck, what's your secret?
SpongeBob: What?
Sandy: Your secret workout. What is it? [everyone wants to know and looks over at SpongeBob. SpongeBob thinks of something nervously and quickly.]
SpongeBob: Hmmm... well... I, uhh... first I... take my hand... and I do this. [makes armpit noises]
Larry: Are you kidding?
SpongeBob: Do these muscles lie? [flexes muscles into a shape of a sponge. Everyone starts making armpit noises]
Sandy: I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you.
SpongeBob: Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.
Sandy: Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test.
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you mean?
Sandy: The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today! Everybody'll be there!
Bartender: Here's your drink. [sets drink on SpongeBob's anchor-arm hand and it sinks down]
Sandy: Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!
SpongeBob: Uhh, well, I'm not sure.
Sandy: C'mon, let's go.
SpongeBob: Right now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a... [tries to run away but the drink is holding him back. Tries lifting the drink but is unsuccessful] Sandy, wait!
Sandy: Here it is-- the sign-in list.
SpongeBob: Oh, no.
Sandy: [signs her name on a piece of paper] Okay, Sannnndy... Cheeks. [puts the paper into entry box]
SpongeBob: [still struggling] Wait, Sandy... don't sign just yet!
[Sandy puts the paper in the box]
SpongeBob: Wait-!
Sandy: Okay...
SpongeBob: [struggles even harder] WAAAAIT!
Sandy: [signs names] SpongeBobbbb SquaaaarePaaaants. [the bartender lifts the drink off of SpongeBob, which sends him flying towards Sandy]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait...! [slams into pole]
Sandy: It's okay, SpongeBob, I already signed your name in.
SpongeBob: Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy. [at the competition]
Announcer: We on? Welcome to the Goo Lagoon 8th annual anchor toss competition. [everyone is getting ready but SpongeBob is nervous]
Sandy: Ready, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Great. No problem. [blows frantically into his Anchor Arms]
Announcer: Could I get some mustard on that? Oh. First up, Don the Whale. [Don throws the anchor and it lands. A measurer fish dashes up to measure distance]
Measurer: 200 yards! [the crowd cheers]
Announcer: Let's see an instant-replay. [another anchor comes flying in on top of the measurer and hits him.] Amazing! Up next, Larry the Lobster. [Larry throws his anchor. The measurer shrieks at the incoming anchor, and runs aside from getting hit; however, the anchor's shadow covers the measurer and crushes him once again]
Measurer: 210 yards!!
Announcer: Here goes, Sandy Cheeks. [Sandy throws it up in the air and kicks it away. The measurer runs around, trying to avoid getting hit by the anchor, but the anchor crushes him anyway]
Measurer: 510 yaaaards!!!
Announcer: Wow! Fabulous!
Sandy: Beat that, SpongeBob!
Announcer: Up next: SpongeBob SquarePants!
Crowd: [imitating the armpit exercise while others are holding up SpongeBob signs and chanting] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tries to pull the anchor but instead he falls under the ground with the anchor and comes out and laughs] Just kidding. Just kidding... heh! [everyone laughs]
Sandy: That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn!
SpongeBob: [to himself] Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp! I'm a jerk!!
[SpongeBob blows his Anchor Arms over the "JERK" size]
SpongeBob: [the crowd goes berserk in cheering] Yeah.
[SpongeBob tries to lift the anchor again but when he tries too hard, some of the air in one arm goes into SpongeBob's nose. Tries to lift again, but the air goes into his left eye as the crowd "ooh"s. SpongeBob tries to lift again and causes the air to go into his left tooth]
Crowd: [chanting] SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob tries to lift again the last time, causing the Anchor Arms to burst around his body, then explode. After the air blows off, the popped Anchor Arms deflate, floating down.]
Crowd Attendee: Ooh, I think he lost. [crowd chants for Sandy] Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! [SpongeBob then reveals his real arms hidden from inside his body. Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and taps her foot, disappointed. SpongeBob walks away, leaving his destroyed Anchor Arms on the ground and follows Sandy to the Treedome]
SpongeBob: 96... 97... 98... 99... 100.
Sandy: I want 100 more.
SpongeBob: It hurts. [changes channel over and over] 1. 2. 3. 4...
Sandy: I think we finally found an exercise for you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: ...9. 10. [his arm falls off] Can you get that?


Squidward: [talking to a wax sculpture of himself] Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eyes...a little lopsided. [takes out the right eye, fixes it then puts it back in place] There. And now that I've been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile! [Squidward makes wax sculpture smile. Then he hears a crash from outside and frowns; the sculpture does as well]
SpongeBob: Hike, Patrick, hike! [both run in separate directions but SpongeBob has a big rock. Drops the rock on the ground and it breaks in half while Patrick blows a chess piece across a chessboard] You just lost three points. [climbs a tree branch] One. Two. Five! [flips upside down and blows a bubble into a shape] G-7!
Patrick: G-7? King me! King me! [runs into the coral branch and pops the bubble] I lose!
SpongeBob: But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.
Patrick: Tartar sauce! [Squidward peeks out]
Squidward: Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: We don't know.
Squidward: Hey, Patrick, do you know what time it is?
Patrick: Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's... [checks his watch but all the bubble soap leaks out when he turns his wrist around]
Squidward: Time to find some other game to play! [laughs. Turns on the record player while taking a bubble bath]
SpongeBob: Now what?
Patrick: [notices a shell on the ground] We could toss that shell back and forth.
SpongeBob: [picks up shell] Okay... ready! [throws shell into Patrick's belly. Patrick shoots it into the air]
Patrick: Go! [SpongeBob goes after it]
SpongeBob: I got it! I got it! [the shell flies through Squid's open window, knocks into Squid's sculpture, and it falls over] I got it! I got it! I got it! [Squid in the other room, hears a thump, but he ignores it. Sponge and Pat enter the room via the elevator] Remember, Patrick, finders keepers.
Patrick: There it is! [points to the shell that is in the wax sculpture of Squidward]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: I got it! I got it! [Patrick pulls the shell out]
Patrick: Bonus points! [Patrick starts to walk off]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.
Patrick: Don't worry. I know how to do this. [Patrick tries to give CPR, but his face turns blue and he floats up to the ceiling but lets out all the air and lands on top of the wax sculpture's head]
SpongeBob: Get off him, Patrick! [Patrick stands up]
Patrick: What are you worried about? [Patrick's butt is now imprinted on the sculpture's face] He looks better already. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick stand him up]
SpongeBob: But he still feels cold.
Patrick: Well, let's go put him in the warm. [they bring the sculpture in front of the window with the sun shining through it]
SpongeBob: Do you think he'll be okay?
Patrick: You know, you worry too much. [the sculpture begins to melt] The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe... [starts to drool as SpongeBob snaps his fingers] ...me. Hey, what's that on your shoe? [SpongeBob looks down]
SpongeBob: I don't know.
Patrick: It kind of looks like... [a liquid puddle of green goo is on the floor]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Squidward! [both are screaming as Squidward is powdering his nose]
SpongeBob: No, no, that part goes here.
Patrick: Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh.
SpongeBob: We're almost there. We can do this.
Patrick: It's working, it's working...
SpongeBob: This is working. [sculpture melts again] Patrick, this isn't working!
Patrick: Look! [eyes turn over]
SpongeBob: I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!
Patrick: Oh, I thought he was dead. [Squidward comes out of the bathroom covered in talcum powder. SpongeBob &amp; Patrick cling to each other and get scared]
Squidward: [screams] What are you doing here?! Well? Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?
SpongeBob: No, stay back!
Squidward: What is the matter with you two?
Patrick: Don't, don't hurt us!
SpongeBob: It was an accident!
Squidward: What are you two talking about? [he notices the goo on the floor and screams] Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll...
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost! [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are bowing before Squidward] Spare us your ghostly anger! [Patrick is kissing Squidward's feet]
Patrick: Oh, yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!
SpongeBob: We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us! [Squidward then gets an idea and grins evilly]
Squidward: Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.
SpongeBob: Does that include...
Squidward: Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!
Patrick: [whispers to SpongeBob] I think they make a cream for that now. [SpongeBob and Patrick carry out Squidward on his bed]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Too hot. [walk a little more then stops]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going. [walks a little more then stops]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Toulouse-Lautrec. [rim shot]
SpongeBob: Too tired... [both stop where they are]
Squidward: Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy. [claps his hands] Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.
SpongeBob: Only the freshest, o spooky one. [both run off. SpongeBob comes back with grapes] A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness. [Squidward eats it while SpongeBob goes and gets a banana] A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness. [squeezes it into Squidward's mouth. Patrick comes back with a watermelon]
Patrick: One watermelon... [drops it into Squidward's mouth, who keels over due to the weight] Fresh from the manure fields, your spookiness. [on the ground, Squidward's head is shaped like the watermelon]
SpongeBob: Art thou not pleased? [Squidward spits out the watermelon]
Squidward&#160;: Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.
Patrick&#160;: What do you hunger for, master?
SpongeBob: Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.
Squidward: Cherry pie. [Patrick holds up a cherry pie] Where'd you get that?
Patrick: I found it. [Squidward takes it and throws it somewhere]
Squidward: Well, go find it again! [Patrick goes searching for it] SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around. [SpongeBob turns around] That's better. Now jog in place. [SpongeBob jogs in place] Say "flank steak".
SpongeBob: Flank steak.
Squidward: I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop. [SpongeBob stops] Now, play me an elaborate song with this! [gives SpongeBob a tissue]
SpongeBob: But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
Squidward: Oh, my. Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo. [SpongeBob blows through the tissue to try and get it to make music]
SpongeBob: I can't do it!
Squidward: Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, 'cause you're not allowed to leave that spot till I hear a song. [walks away. Day turns into night and into day again and SpongeBob is lying on the ground with the tissue on his nose] What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.
Patrick: [comes back with the pie] I found it. [Squidward takes it]
Squidward: I'll take that! [throws pie in Patrick's face]
Patrick: Yes, your ghostliness! [licks filling off his face] This is fun.
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you ready for this?
Patrick: Yes. [SpongeBob walks a couple steps forward]
SpongeBob: Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming? [Patrick is facing the wrong way]
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's this way.
Patrick: Where?
SpongeBob: Here.
Patrick: [turns around] Oh, coming! [both enter a room in the back with a bunch of junk in it] How are we going to clean up all this mess?
SpongeBob: It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off! [tears the wall]
Patrick: [laughs] Oh look, you missed some. [SpongeBob picks up a book]
SpongeBob: Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman. [shows picture in the book] It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?
Patrick: We're going to go shopping?
SpongeBob: No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest. [Squidward is laying on the couch, SpongeBob &amp; Patrick spit spitballs at him]
Squidward: Ow! What the heck was that?
SpongeBob: Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
Squidward: Ceremony for what?
SpongeBob: We're going to put you to rest.
Squidward: I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Oh, really? I'm going to go check. [walks off. Opens door and screams because he sees Patrick &amp; SpongeBob with a coffin]
SpongeBob: Okay, get in.
Squidward: Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing!
SpongeBob: But you said we could put you to rest.
Squidward: I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick outside ]
Squidward: Now what? [Squidward sees SpongeBob writing on a tombstone]
SpongeBob: I wrote "Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but he..." [Squidward screams] Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough?
Squidward: SpongeBob! Cut that out!
SpongeBob: Oh, look, the mourners have arrived. [a bus with a load of people are in front of Squidward's house]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?
SpongeBob: No, just into this hole.
Squidward: [Groans then sighs] SpongeBob, I have a confession to make. [Takes off his night cap]
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're bald?
Squidward&#160;: No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!
SpongeBob: But-
Squidward: Do it!
SpongeBob: Go home. [People get back on bus sadly] But I, Master--
Squidward: I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and stop doing me favors! [walks off]
SpongeBob: As you wish, master.
Squidward: D'oh!
Patrick: Boy, he really had us fooled.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.
Patrick: You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.
SpongeBob: Patrick, say that again.
Patrick: That again?
SpongeBob: No, the other thing.
Patrick: No, the other thing.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] No, what you said before when you...
Patrick: No, what you said before when you...
SpongeBob: Never mind! I've got an idea.
Patrick: Never mind! I've got an idea. [SpongeBob gets annoyed again. Later, Squidward is reclining on his chair outside. SpongeBob is trying to blow a bubble big enough to get Squidward]
SpongeBob: I can't reach him!
Patrick: Blow harder! [SpongeBob blows a big bubble to consume Squidward. The bubble lifts Squidward gently from his chair. The octopus doesn't notice that he's floating.] There he goes!
SpongeBob: Isn't he beautiful?
Patrick: How high's he going to go? [Squidward sees he's floating]
SpongeBob: All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond. [both of them wave to Squidward] Goodbye, friend!
Patrick: Happy trails! [Squidward pounds his fists on the bubble and tries to yell, but his voice is so distorted by the soapy wall that unintelligible muffled noises come through.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: He's on the other side now.
Patrick: Yeah. [Squidward is floating above the sea at Bikini Atoll island in a bubble] He's in a better place. [Squidward moans in the bubble with seagulls flying around him]


[At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is sniffing a Krabby Patty, then squirts a mustard "checkmark" on the patty and puts on the bun. Just then, SpongeBob hears Pearl come in crying. SpongeBob gets a pan and puts it on top of his head for protection from the tears.]
Mr. Krabs: Don't cry, love. Daddy's going to make it all right. Calm down, girl! [a wave of water from the tears busts the door down, but SpongeBob pushes the door back up for a couple seconds, then the water comes breaking through the door and wipes out all the customers, dropping them to the floor. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs with part of a table around his face]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?
Mr. Krabs: Her scurvy prom date stood her up, boy, and now, she can't seem to find another.
Pearl: That's because there's only one fish in the sea that's long, tan and handsome as he is. And that's him!
Mr. Krabs: No, no, baby, no more crying. We'll get you a date. Why, uhh... I'll take ya! [Pearl begins to cry and an earthquake starts] Well, what about Squidward? [Squidward is filing his tentacles. Pearl cries even harder and makes the earthquake even worse]
Mr. Krabs: Wait, wait. Here, take SpongeBob!
Pearl: Ahh! the fry cook? Do you know what that would do to my complexion? People would mistake me for a planetarium.
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
Pearl: I don't know. But I can't take him, daddy! They'll kick me off the most frequently pictured in the yearbook committee.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, they would. We've got to find someone else. Listen up! Which one of you lucky lubbers wants to take me lovely daughter Pearl to the prom? [everyone runs away]
Pearl: Just don't be late, SpongeBob. [sadly walks off]
Mr. Krabs: Now listen, boy, I'm-a counting on you to make this a very special night for a very special girl. Remember, you're doing it for good old Mr... [the real SpongeBob walks up behind him]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It's pretty realistic isn't it? [holds up the left arm] I made this part out of...
Mr. Krabs: Never mind that, boy! You're taking Pearl to her prom!
SpongeBob: Really? Oh, wow! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert! [now at home] Oh, Gary, I'm a prom failure. I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What is it, Gary? What do you have? [Gary hides in his shell while SpongeBob takes out a magazine from Gary's shell. Magazine is 'Long Tan and Handsome'] Hey, Gary, this magazine gives me an idea! [SpongeBob cuts through some black fabric then sews it up. Then he takes a shower and plucks his eyebrows to put in some new ones. Then he plants some seeds into the tuxedo and waters it to grow a pink flower. Now, he ties his shoes which are on stilts] Long. [pops out of a toaster as some bread] Tan. [licks his two front teeth that are braced up] Handsome. Okay, Gary, wait ‘til Pearl gets an eyeful of this! [Gary hides in his shell. Later, SpongeBob's limo drives up to Mr. Krabs house. SpongeBob rings the door bell and Mr. Krabs opens the door]
Mr. Krabs: Hello? [SpongeBob lowers himself by some sort of crank] What do you think, Pearl? Cleans up pretty well, doesn't he?
Pearl: [wearing a pink dress] Well, at last no one will recognize you. Now listen, SpongeBob, I just want to get through this with my social status intact. [SpongeBob writes down a list of what Pearl wants to do on a notepad] I want to go to the prom, get my picture taken, and I want to dance... [SpongeBob has a big list now] ...I want to drink punch with my friends and don't do that other thing you're always doing...
SpongeBob: Uhh, Pearl, we've got to get back to the limo.
Pearl: [claps] A limo! Why didn't you say so? [Pearl grabs SpongeBob and drags him out of the house] I love limousines!
Mr. Krabs: Go easy on him, lassie! I can't afford to break in a new fry cook! [laughs and closes the door. Now at the prom where the limo is driving up, but the back wheels are flat so it is screeching on the road]
SpongeBob: [checks his list] Well, I guess the first thing we should do is... [flash goes off where the pictures are being held]
Pearl: Yay! My first prom picture!
SpongeBob: Uh-uh-uh... our first prom picture. [Pearl sprays him with something that deflates his arm]
Pearl: Let's get this over with. [SpongeBob is having trouble getting over to the photo-shoot] Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Be right there.
Pearl: Will you hurry up?
SpongeBob: Just a second. Coming! [SpongeBob messes up his footing and jumps everywhere and apologizes to everyone but eventually gets to the photo-shoot. He holds onto the curtain to keep his balance] Sorry! Pardon me! Here I am...! Cheese...! [curtain collapses on them and the photo is taken] That'll be a keeper.
Judy: Hey, look, it's Pearl! Hi, Pearl!
Pearl: SpongeBob, here come my friends. Uhh, go get me some punch!
SpongeBob: Prom expert; away! [jumps away as Pearl's friends walk up to her]
Judy &amp; Friend: Hi, Pearl!
Pearl: Hi, girls.
Judy: I'd like you to meet Billy Fishkins!
Billy: Meep.
Friend: And you know Brian Flounder from math class.
Brian: Meep.
Pearl: Hi Brian.
Friend: So, like, where's your date, Pearl? We're all dying to meet him.
Pearl: He's over at the punch bowl getting me some punch. [friend looks for SpongeBob]
Judy: Ohh, is he the really tall one?
Pearl: Oh, yes! [notices what SpongeBob is doing] I mean... Oh no. [SpongeBob is trying to reach for the spoon to get some punch, but can't reach because he is too tall, the spoon is alive. He misplaces his footing and gets the punch all over him. Pearl pushes her friends away] Oh, quick, let's go see how ugly Cindy's dress is! [SpongeBob hands two glasses of punch to some people] SpongeBob, what are you doing?! [SpongeBob has red skin now from the punch. He squeezes some juice from his nose and into the glass]
SpongeBob: Hi, Pearl! Come on, it won't bite!
Pearl: You look ridiculous! [gasps]
SpongeBob: What is it? [Pearl pushes him under the table]
Pearl: Get down, he'll see us! It's my ex-boyfriend, Octavius Rex, a.k.a. long, tan and handsome!
Octavius: Meep.
SpongeBob: Whoa. But, I bet he isn't holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy! [holds it up, but another guy takes it away because it's his]
Anchovy: Give me that back.
SpongeBob: [giggles] That just didn't happen. Let's go! [takes Pearl to the dance floor] Ready? [dances like crazy]
Pearl: SpongeBob, what are you doing? Can't you see everybody here is doing 'the whack'? [the couples are jumping at each other with their chests. We see couples jumping up and hitting each other]
SpongeBob: The whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one. [tries to jump]
Pearl: Are you sure you can do this? [SpongeBob jumps at Pearl, but they hit another couple and send them flying through the food table, shattering food and kitchenware. One of the people crash through a fruit painting]
Painter: Aaah! a monster! [jumps into a trash can which makes everyone else scream and go crazy]
Pearl: Well, I guess you can take me home now, now that you've ruined everything! [cries]
SpongeBob: Don't cry, the prom expert is here! I haven't failed yet! [looks through the list he wrote down] Hey, we can still... no, I broke that. We could... no. Don't cry! D-d-don't cry. [At this point, SpongeBob seems to be talking to himself more than he is to Pearl.] Whatever you do, don't... [cries, runs off]
Judy: Wow, what did you do to him? Poor little guy. [SpongeBob runs into the ladie’s bathroom. A couple girls run off screaming]
Pearl: [walks up outside the ladies restroom] Sponge, are you okay?
SpongeBob: [crying] — Messed everything up.
Pearl: Don't worry, SpongeBob, ya didn't mess everything up.
SpongeBob: [crying] — Hot dog!
Pearl: Actually, it was pretty funny when that hot dog landed in Judy's hair.
SpongeBob: [crying] All I wanted was to have a good time!
Pearl: But I am having a good time! Ya know, we haven't finished our dance yet.
SpongeBob: [whimpers] Can I still wear the wig?
Pearl: Yes, you can still wear the wig. [SpongeBob runs out and grabs Pearl to the dance floor]
SpongeBob: Let's go!
♪All right, you invertebrates. I'm gonna teach you how to do The Sponge. Well, first you take your leg and you stick it in the air, And then you take the other one and jam it right up there, You twist yourself around and give a great big lunge, Now you're doin' The Sponge. Huh, do The Sponge, Sponge, oh do The Sponge, Beat your buns you're doin' The Sponge. Well, now, first you take your leg And you stick it in the air, And then you take the other one, And you jam it right up there, You twist yourself around And you give a great big lunge, Now you're doin', yeah, now you're doin' The Sponge.♪
Pearl: [Octavius Rex walks up to Pearl] Get lost, pizza topping! Can't you see I'm doing the Sponge? [People are still breaking stuff and running around screaming, an old lady is tied up with two men, two men crash into themselves, their heads are upside down as the paramedics run out carrying people out on their stretcher. Some are hurt and crying. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Pearl are still dancing. Pearl takes SpongeBob and wraps him into a basketball. Shoots and the word "score" lights up on the scoreboard. Angry people from the prom pick up both SpongeBob and Pearl and carry them over to the door]
Angry crowd: Get out!
SpongeBob &amp; Pearl: They love us! Yay, we're popular! [Both thrown out of the gym]
Angry crowd: And don't come back!
Long, tan and handsome Anchovy leader: Go wreck someone else's prom, will ya? [Goes back inside gym. Later, SpongeBob and Pearl walking up to her house]
SpongeBob: Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned.
Pearl: Oh, don't worry, SpongeBob, I knew it would be a total disaster all along. But as long as disasters go, that was really fun. [Mr. Krabs opens up the door]
Mr. Krabs: A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower! [Pearl gasps] You almost stepped on it. [rakes the flower in the ground. SpongeBob froze in his spot]
Pearl: Oh, daddy! Well, good night, short, yellow and spongy. SpongeBob? [shrugs her shoulders and walks back inside]
Mr. Krabs: Good job, laddie. [winks at him and goes back inside. The real SpongeBob appears from the side]
SpongeBob: Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! [laughs].


SpongeBob: [Gary is on his exercise wheel] Exercise time is over, Gary. [takes Gary off his wheel] We don't want you getting too thin. [holds up a green, squishy ball] Here, boy. Fetch! [throws it and Gary goes after it but at a slow pace. SpongeBob checks his watch and sits on a chair and takes out the newspaper to read. Morning arrives, the rooster crows and SpongeBob is asleep in the chair. Gary crawls up to SpongeBob and spits out the ball]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? [sees the ball on the ground]  Good job, Gary! [He jumps to Gary] I love you, Gary! [He starts scratching Gary and Gary purrs] Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary! [Gary climbs up on SpongeBob, purring and tickling him] Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha! [Patrick comes through the door]
Patrick: SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
SpongeBob: For what?
Patrick: The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend! [shows his jellyfishing net off until he breaks something and blushes with embarrassment] So, you ready or what?
SpongeBob: That was this weekend? [He looks up at Gary who's still crawling all over him trying to tickle him] I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
[There's a knock on the door. Squidward is seen outside. The door opens, but the first thing Squidward sees is Gary on SpongeBob's head. He looks down at SpongeBob and reveals a pair of underwear.]
Squidward: Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
Squidward: What's a Gary?
SpongeBob: Not a Gary. Gary. He's my pet snail. [shows Gary to Squidward] Say hello! [Gary hisses at Squidward and drools]
Squidward: Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
SpongeBob: I love Gary!
Squidward: Well, I don't. Get somebody else. [walks off]
SpongeBob: I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick. [Squidward stops]
Squidward: Go away? [walks in reverse back to SpongeBob's Pineapple] You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
SpongeBob: Actually, a three day weekend.
Squidward: As in, not here for three days?
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.
Patrick: Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
Squidward: I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
SpongeBob: You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk.[SpongeBob explains the daily routine with Gary, but Squidward is busy thinking of how much fun he'll have with SpongeBob &amp; Patrick away]
Squidward: Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend.
SpongeBob: Let me show you how to feed him. [opens a cabinet with six barrels of Gary's food] The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
Squidward: Sure it's enough? [bus drives up to the pineapple with other jellyfishers inside]
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Patrick: The bus is here! The bus is here! [crashes through the wall and through the bus leaving his starfish shape through each hole] C'mon, SpongeBob!
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Squidward: [pushing SpongeBob out of the house] Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye bye.
SpongeBob: Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
Squidward: I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.
SpongeBob: Gary.
Squidward: Right, yeah, right. [bus drives off] Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers! [laughs with joy] They're gone! [runs inside his Easter Island Head. Gary peeks his eyes out the window]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: [comes out with shorts on and his nose with sunscreen on it and a chair. Unfolds the chair and sits on it] This is going to be the best three days of my life. [sighs and lays back with a sun reflector in front of him] I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob. [The time card "3 Days Later" appears, and now Squidward is badly sunburned, The bus comes back as the group is chanting "jellyfishing"] Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me. [Squidward sees Gary through the window. Gary groans. Squidward's sunburn drains] [screams] The snail! I forgot the snail! [runs inside the pineapple where Gary is old and withered on the floor. Squidward frantically takes him inside to the kitchen] I've got to do something. [takes all the barrels of food and puts it in his bowl] Okay, okay, okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here. [Squidward frantically throws the food at Gary's trying to get him to eat it] [Gary lip syncing what Squidward's saying]: Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat! You've gotta finish this food!
SpongeBob: See you later, Patrick.
Squidward: Come on, eat! Eat! Eat! [SpongeBob gets his house key out. Squidward has to decide about the food] Ohh...
SpongeBob: [sticks the key in the hole and opens the door] Gary! I'm home!
Squidward: [greets SpongeBob with a head full of Gary's food that he ate] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Squidward! What are you doing here? [Squidward swallows all the food]
Squidward: Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
SpongeBob: What a great friend you are, Squidward.
Squidward: So, uhh, well, see you. Goodbye.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. [Gary crawls to SpongeBob, still old and wrinkly] I can always count on you. [Gary moans and SpongeBob screams] Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward! [Squidward frowns ‘cause he can't leave. Later, the doctors snail-mobile is in front of the pineapple]
Brock: Yes, yes, it's just as I thought.
SpongeBob: What?
Brock: This is definitely a snail.
SpongeBob: I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that?
Brock: Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered. Here you go. [hands the shot to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Aren't you going to do it?
Brock: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm too squeamish. [doctor leaves. Squidward runs after him]
Squidward: Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.
Squidward: Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do... [Gary moans and coughs badly]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: Okay, okay, I'll do it. [takes the shot]
SpongeBob: Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady. [Squidward tries to give Gary the shot but SpongeBob pulls him away] Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again. [Squidward keeps trying but gets the same result every time]
Squidward: Will you hold him still? [snail plasma shot in SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.
Squidward: Well, you made me do it!
SpongeBob: What's going to happen to me?
Squidward: Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.
SpongeBob: I don't know, I feel kind of funny!
Squidward: I'm telling you, it's all in your head. [Gary crawls to his water bowl to get a drink. After drinking the water, he gargles, clears his throat, and meows normally again.]
Squidward: He just needed water?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you're better! [hugs him]
Squidward: Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
Squidward: Trust me, SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine. [closes door]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
Gary: [jumps up] Meow! [SpongeBob pours food into Gary's bowl, but decides to see what it tastes like. He likes it so he eats all of it. Then walks to Gary with the empty bowl]
SpongeBob: Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself. [burps] Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top! [SpongeBob begins to walk out of the kitchen. His feet make loud pounding noises as they hit the floor, and he begins to go slower and slower. Soon Gary is going faster than he is.]
SpongeBob: Gary, you're getting a [voice slows, lowers] lot faster! [SpongeBob sluggishly walks into the bathroom, and Gary follows him. He looks in the mirror, and his voice echoes as he speaks.]
SpongeBob:  Look at me. Never better. [He yelps as dramatic music begins to play in the background. His head begins to throb, and his pores begin to grow and shrink, before returning to normal.] I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine! [What he doesn't realize is that the worst is yet to come. His eyes bug out of his head, causing him to yell. The camera rotates around so we can get a side view of SpongeBob. He blinks, and his eyes briefly pop back into his head and return to normal. But this relief only lasts for about half a second. Then, his eyes bulge out even farther than before, and it looks very unnatural. They bulge for a while, and then they begin to transform, taking the shape and form of snail's eyes, with stalks. The sight causes SpongeBob's jaw to drop, and he screams louder. SpongeBob stares in the bathroom mirror at his brand-new eyestalks, which now have skin and eyelids around them. He turns to Gary.]
SpongeBob:  Gary... I'm fine! [But SpongeBob is not fine. Gary watches in horror as his owner falls onto his hands and knees, straining in pain.]
SpongeBob:  [in so much pain that he is barely comprehensible] Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see. [grunts and strains as his hand and arm slowly retract into his sleeve, which then pops off and bounces away] That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway! [Then, SpongeBob's feet and legs retract into his pants.]
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Ha! Now I don't have to buy those new shoes! [his body shortens up like a snail and he screams] I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeee [he loses the ability to talk and completes his snail transformation] ow!
Squidward: [in his bed with his clarinet] I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary. [a knock is heard on the door and the doorbell rings] Who could that be? As if I didn't already know. [Camera goes to Squidward’s front door. Squidward turns on the light, walks to the door, and opens it] SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just-- [attempts to say “fine,” but hesitates and shouts almost hysterically. SpongeBob is now a fully breaded snail.]
SpongeBob: Meow!
Squidward: [screams]
SpongeBob: Meow! Meow. [Squidward touches SpongeBob's left eye and it curls up]
Squidward: [screams and runs back inside shutting the door]
Squidward: SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done? [picks up the snail plasma shot] It's all your fault. [throws it away] Okay, okay, okay, okay, get it together, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Meow! [Squidward screams and puts boards on his door. Turns around and SpongeBob is at his window] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams] Meow! [Squidward puts more boards on his window, but SpongeBob squeezes through the boards holes] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams and runs into his closet]
Squidward: None of this would be happening if I'd only fed that snail! [SpongeBob squeezes in from under the door, and meows. Squidward screams and runs through his door, SpongeBob meows, Squidward runs up and down his ceiling, screaming and mumbling, while SpongeBob keeps meowing at him. Outside, his house is bouncing from side to side until it flips on its side completely. Everything is broken and torn inside. Squidward sits up, but is injected with the snail plasma through his nose]
Squidward: Uh-oh! [now SpongeBob, Squidward, and Gary are on a fence singing "Blow the Man Down"]
Gary: Meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A], meow [F] .
SpongeBob: Meow [A], meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A] .
Squidward: Meow [C], meow [D], meow [B♭], meow [A], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Gary: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G], meow [E] .
SpongeBob: Meow [G], meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Squidward: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [A], meow [G], meow [A], meow [F] .
Gary: [Off-screen] Meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A], meow [F] .
Patrick: [opens his rock. He is wearing pajamas] Will you clam up?! [throws a boot]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen at the same time] Meow [A], meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A] .
Squidward: Meow [C], me- [D] Ommf! [boot knocks him off the fence]
Gary: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G], meow [E] .
SpongeBob: Meow [G], meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Squidward: Meow [D], meow [D], meow [D], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A], meow [G], meow [A], meow [F].


[SpongeBob is lurking around, heading home, looking for Sandy because they are playing karate. He suspects the pineapple of being Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! Oh, sorry, pineapple house. I thought you were someone else. [walks inside] Ah, what a great day at work. [hears something] Huh? Yeah... [tip toes over to the couch, but makes duck sounds as he tip toes. He realizes he's been stepping on three squeaky toy ducks, and in frustration, he kicks them away. Then he runs in front of his couch] I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge... [jumps behind the couch and no one is there] ...Bob. [has his back to the couch while he squeezes his eyes through the couch looking for Sandy. When he thinks he has spotted her, he runs out from behind the couch and in front of the TV] I got you now! Hi-yah! [no one is there, so he sits on the couch and watches TV] Well, I guess the coast is clear.
TV: [shows a royal gramma fish] Yeah, shopping's weird. Did you ever go into the seafood aisle and say “Who eats this stuff"? [TV audience and SpongeBob laugh]
SpongeBob: I love this show! [Sandy is sitting next to SpongeBob]
Sandy: Me too! [SpongeBob screams and begins to fight]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [Sandy puts on her green karate gear]
Sandy: Hi-yah! [SpongeBob high-kicks in slow-motion]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [Sandy runs off then drives forward, but SpongeBob jumps his upper half of his body to avoid Sandy] Uhh, just a second. [runs off, but returns with his red karate gear on] Safety first! [he winks] And now, spin technique! [spins around and lunges towards Sandy]
Sandy: Hi-yah! Yah. [SpongeBob grabs her hand and spins her around]
SpongeBob: Double overhand squirrel knot! [turns her into a round knot and throws her through the door like a bowling ball]
Sandy: I'm gonna get you tomorrow, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: That'll be the day. [spins his arms and legs around. Pans over to nighttime at Sandy's treedome, when the phone rings]
Sandy: Hello? [SpongeBob's arm tries to karate chop Sandy, but Sandy takes SpongeBob's hand and puts it through the phone to karate chop himself] Nice try, SpongeBrain! [hangs up phone. Later, at Barg’N’Mart, Sandy is shopping when a box of Kelpo falls. She thinks it's SpongeBob, so she gets in her karate stance] Yah! [notices the box of Kelpo] Heh, silly me. [But when she walks a few more steps, SpongeBob is there in his karate gear]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?
Sandy: I don't think so.
SpongeBob: Well, it goes like this! [stretches his arm to ricochet off a shelf and the ceiling to come at Sandy] Oh, wait, I forgot the punch line. [His arm stops right before hitting Sandy] Oh, yeah! [hits the loose board on the floor, sending Sandy into a pile of tin cans] That's a good one, isn't it? [later, SpongeBob is walking down the road] What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful... [sees a pile of tin cans on the ground] pile of cans? Mmm, mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet. [He puts on karate gear]
Sandy: No it's not, SpongeBob. [shows him a squirrel mask] This is! [jumps in front of SpongeBob] Now, prepare for a long, merciless whooping! [grabs SpongeBob's tongue and takes out a bottle of hot sauce] Mmmm, my favorite.
[SpongeBob whimpers in fear as a drop of hot sauce hangs over the edge of the bottle and Tom Kenny's face appears on the drop]
Volcano Sauce Drop: Eheheheheheh! [cut to SpongeBob's confused face, and then back to the Volcano Sauce Drop] By the powers of naughtiness, I command this particular drop of hot sauce to be really... really... hot!
[SpongeBob gasps.]
SpongeBob: Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours.
Sandy: I knew you'd come to your senses, SpongeBob.
[Sandy drinks the bottle of hot sauce. While she is doing this, SpongeBob takes out his tongue revealing a label that says "Novelty Toy" and he wraps the fake tongue she was holding around her and spins her]
SpongeBob: Yah.
[Sandy karate chops SpongeBob far away]
Sandy: Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Curses! [Now at the Krusty Krab, the line is very long]
Customer: With extra cheese. To go!
Squidward: Three patties, four large oyster skins, on the double, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is still wearing his karate gear]
SpongeBob: Oh yeah. Gotcha! [SpongeBob opens a door]
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What? [karate chops Squidward's face]
Squidward: I'm going to pretend that didn't happen. [throws two pieces of paper at SpongeBob] Now fill these orders or leave, SpongeBob. We're very busy today! [SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen with tray of patties in his hands]
SpongeBob: Order up. [stops as he sees a customer karate chopping a fly. The customer turns into Sandy who is in her gear and winks at SpongeBob]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Now are you gonna... [SpongeBob throws the tray backwards at Squidward, causing the Krabby Patties to land on Squidward's head]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward. I was going through some records back in me office and--Huh? So, you got the hairpiece after all.
SpongeBob: Hi-yah!
Fred: [under the floor] My leg!
SpongeBob: Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! ‘Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this! [does something with his hands] Ssss! [Points at Fred, then walks backwards] Took care of her, yes I did. [bumps into Mr. Krabs] Oh, ahoy, sir!
Mr. Krabs: What was that?
SpongeBob: But, sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo.
Mr. Krabs: Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?
SpongeBob: No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it.
Mr. Krabs: Kara-tay? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward. [he walks off. Later, at closing time, Squidward is mopping the floor]
Squidward: SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet? [SpongeBob is staring at his hands]
SpongeBob: Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah!
Squidward: [frustrated] Go!
[SpongeBob walks into the bathroom with a mop and a bucket in his hands. He hears a sneeze, so he opens a door, but nobody is there]
SpongeBob: Hah! [opens the next stall door and jumps in it] Sandy! [Mr. Krabs walks out of the stall with SpongeBob in his hand]
Mr. Krabs: No more.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs grabs a hold of SpongeBob's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Shh! No more of this karate stuff, lad. Or you're fired. [lets go of his mouth and walks away]
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Fired? [walks out] No more karate? How am I gonna tell Sandy?
Sandy: Hi-yah! [jumps at SpongeBob and starts karate chopping him]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate.
Sandy: [stops] Uh-huh. Sure, SpongeBob. [Sandy karate chops him again]
SpongeBob: No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop.
Sandy: [stops] I'm not falling for it, SpongeBob! [karate chops him even more]
SpongeBob: No, really! Please, stop! [Mr. Krabs looks out the window]
Mr. Krabs: What the? [walks outside] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams]
SpongeBob: Ahh, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What did I just get through telling ye, lad?
SpongeBob: But I, uhh, she...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're fired!
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Fired? [his face gets smaller until it's not there anymore]
Mr. Krabs: Eh?
Sandy: SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's face reappears and he then bursts out crying and runs everywhere] Wait, Mr. Krabs, it's not his fault! It's- it's mine! He tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen! [SpongeBob is crying into a cup and drinking his tears. Now he's flipping over and over around Sandy and Mr. Krabs] Give him another chance, please?
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm. [grabs SpongeBob as he runs] Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind. [sniffs Sandy] Mmm, mammals. [walks off]
Sandy: Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing. [she and SpongeBob sigh] Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about [karate chops SpongeBob] this?
SpongeBob: [laughs, then suddenly stops] Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!
Sandy: We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.
SpongeBob: We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh. [picks up a rock] We can squeeze things! [squeezes the rock and drops it] Woo! How much fun was that?
Sandy: Almost some.
SpongeBob: I know! We can act like plants. [lies on the ground and opens and closes his legs and arms] Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.
Sandy: Wanna go to the park? [SpongeBob and Sandy are at the park. SpongeBob is holding a basket in one hand]
SpongeBob: Karate sure is dumb.
Sandy: Yeah, you can say that again.
SpongeBob: I feel dumb just thinking about it. [puts the basket down] Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!
Sandy: You like what?
SpongeBob: Not karate.
Sandy: Ha! I don't even know what that is.
SpongeBob: Me, too. I don't know what anything is! In fact...
Fisherman: [casting off his fishing rod] Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: [giggles] For a second, that sounded like.
Sandy: Karate?
SpongeBob: Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate? [opens up the basket] Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?
Sandy: Karate.
SpongeBob: What did you say?
Sandy: Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich. [takes out some mustard] There we go. [SpongeBob pulls out some barnacle loaf]
SpongeBob: How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?
Sandy: One. Just one.
SpongeBob: One for you! [karate chops a slice off]
Sandy: Hmmm?
SpongeBob: And one for me! [chops off another slice in slow-motion]
Sandy: Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hmm?
Sandy: Maybe just one more. Uhh, I'm kinda hungry.
[SpongeBob brings out the barnacle loaf again]
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Sandy. [lifts up his hand]
Sandy: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Sandy: Do you think, umm, do you think I could cut this one?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sure.
Sandy: Thanks. Hi-yah! [chops one slice] Is that enough?
SpongeBob: Maybe just one more. Or two!
Sandy: Or three!
SpongeBob: Or ten!
Sandy: Ten! Yes, ten! Because we're really hungry!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right! [chops off more slices and they fly everywhere]
SpongeBob: Time for buns! [throws a bunch of buns in the air and chops them in half]
Sandy: How about some tomatoes?
SpongeBob: And I'll cut the cheese! [both throw the cheese and tomatoes in the air while chopping them into a bunch of slices that land on the patties]
Sandy: And, what else should we slice? [SpongeBob grabs more buns]
SpongeBob: More buns!
Sandy: [Sandy grabs two heads of lettuce] And lettuce!
Both: Yeah! [both slice up more food to complete their Krabby Patties and one of the buns lands on an earthworm]
SpongeBob: Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy? [Sandy has a dazed look on her face] Right? I guess I'll eat one now. [reaches for a patty, but Sandy karate chops his arm with her green foam hand]
Sandy: You're mince meat!
SpongeBob: [in his red karate gear] In your dreams! Hi-yah! [both start to karate chop each other. Later, Mr. Krabs is walking through the park, carrying an umbrella]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? What the barnacle? [Everything in the park is chopped in half. Sandy is chopping wood while SpongeBob rests on a rock]
SpongeBob: Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate?
Mr. Krabs: [clearing his throat to get SpongeBob's attention]  Bleuhahugh!
SpongeBob: [screams] Mr. Krabs! [tries to hold a tree back in one piece] Uhh, hey, Mr. Krabs, how’s it going? [holds the rock in one piece] Nice day, huh? [half of the tree falls on SpongeBob's head] Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.
Mr. Krabs: Fire ya? [grabs a couple Krabby Patties] I've got something else in mind. [at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Sandy are karate chopping up Krabby Patties for the customers. Sandy is chopping up the meat and SpongeBob is chopping up the mustard]
Sandy: I love karate!
SpongeBob: I love kara-tay!
Mr. Krabs: I love money-ay! [He holds some money]
Squidward: I hate all of you.


SpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary. [takes off shoes and socks but socks still standing up but when SpongeBob throws them on the floor, the socks go down and Gary puts them on his eyes]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary. [pulls socks off Gary's eyes] You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. [snores and a dream cloud appears with the background of Krusty Krab stuff. SpongeBob eyes appear then his shoes and then his mouth on a rock] Hey! Over here! [laughs while his arms wiggle on the ground. Both arms attach to the rock and the rock moves over to the other items. SpongeBob's arms grab the eyes and puts them on the rock, his pants start appearing, and then his legs come out and put his shoes on and his body is seen. A car comes over SpongeBob and sits him in it. SpongeBob's nose grows out] Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! [driver's license appears] Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! [Car starts to move crazily] I sure take a good picture. [drives through a sign that says "Road Ends"] Darn! I should have grown a mustache. [the boat starts bumping up and down rapidly; SpongeBob is now driving off-road, hitting bumps in the sand; he smashes into a rock and flies out of the boat, still holding his license] How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. [flies over the Krusty Krab] Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. [Mrs. Puff floats up to him] Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
Mrs. Puff: [takes his license and tears it up] Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
SpongeBob: No! [flies through the dream cloud and on SpongeBob's real bed] Ouch! Where am I? [walks and looks up to his real self] Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
Gary: Meow. [snoring] Meow.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Gary's dream cloud] This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. [jumps into the dream cloud. He falls down into a library] Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. [walks past a pile of books] Gary! Huh? [sees Gary, who is now taller and wearing a cape, reading a book. He walks up to him] Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? [Gary turns around]
Gary: [gasps] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gary?
Gary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
SpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!
Gary: [sighs] In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Gary: Come. [they walk down an aisle of books] For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. [picks up a book and reads from it] "Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again." Emily Dickinson wrote that.
SpongeBob: Who?
Gary: [flips a few pages] Here's one you might know. [clears throat] There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
Gary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. [starts walking away]
Gary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
SpongeBob: [jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window] I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. [Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring. SpongeBob runs over] I can't resist! [laughs and jumps into the dream cloud. Inside, he opens a door to see Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride amidst the blank, white scenery] Hey, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [walks over] You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. [transforms into the shape of a skyscraper] Going up! Eh? [sees that Patrick is unresponsive and frowns, then perks up again] I can make... [changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself] A million of me! Eh? Eh?
Patrick: Yup. [the clones disappear] 
SpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. [leaves]
Patrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob. [kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away] Oh! [the quarter falls into a grate] Shoot, that was my last quarter. [sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good! [inflates himself with air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head] Psst! Squidward! [waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing] Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
King: Ahem! [sitting in the balcony above the stage] Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Squidward: Yes, Your Highness. [Squidward resumes playing, but SpongeBob tells the king a joke. The king laughs and Squidward stops playing again. He angrily stands up] SpongeBob!
King: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! [giggles, turns to SpongeBob and nudges him with his elbow] Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
Squidward: [growling, pressing down on his clarinet] Sponge- [accidentally breaks the clarinet. The audience gasps] Bob...
King: [angry] I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
Squidward: [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: [as a clarinet] Squidward! [points to himself and winks] Huh? Huh?
Squidward: [throws his broken clarinet pieces off-stage. Speaking with his back turned] No way.
King: Ahem! [glares down at Squidward]
Squidward: [sighs and picks SpongeBob up] Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.
SpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward. [Squidward blows into him]
SpongeBob: [off-key] La la! La la la la la la la! [The audience gasps again]
Squidward: [stops playing] SpongeBob!
King: [crying] Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
[Squidward smiles and SpongeBob winks at him]
SpongeBob: [continues singing off-key]
Fish: [crying] His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
[crowd cheers]
Squidward: [bowing] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [the crowd knocks him aside into a fruit wagon and a fish grabs SpongeBob]
Fish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
SpongeBob: [turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him. Squidward has climbed out of the wagon and is a mess] So long, Squidward! [Squidward starts to growl at him, but the audience members push him back into the fruit wagon and chase after SpongeBob. The King follows, too, laughing. SpongeBob runs out the door and flies away.]
Squidward: [starts tossing and turning in his bed, mumbling in angered pain]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands on the top of the tree dome] Hey! I'm at Sandy's! [Sandy sleeps in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door] Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... [falls out of the plane and screams]
Sandy: [surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?
Sandy: [turns upside down] Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. [a target is shown on the ground. SpongeBob and Sandy spin around]
SpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!
Sandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
SpongeBob: Okay! [gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate]
Sandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! [turns upside-down again]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger]
Sandy: Not a parakeet! Para- [Lands in a truck of clam manure, parachute inflates out of time] medic...
SpongeBob: [screams as he crashes through the target, breaking the ground and flips on the real-life ground] Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. [sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house] H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. [climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream. Shows a view of various girly decorations, other girly features and boyfriend portraits.] Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Pearl: Hello, SpongeBob! [sits at a table with a green rabbit toy and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup]
SpongeBob: [waves] Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Pearl: You're just in time for the tea party!
SpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Pearl: [Frowns] Oh. He's next door. [Rolls eyes, then shakes head in disappointment] Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
SpongeBob: Bye! [gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs on the right side of the screen] I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. [peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs’ boat]
Krabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon! [inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod] You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. [SpongeBob hops into the boat]
SpongeBob: Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Krabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. [Moby Dollar appears from the water, caught on the fishing hook] It's the mighty Moby Dollar! [Starts reeling in, making the Moby Dollar come closer and closer.] Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes! [Moby Dollar starts spitting out pennies] There she blows!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
Krabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
SpongeBob: [grabs a small jellyfishing net] This one?
Krabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
SpongeBob: [reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it] Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Krabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
SpongeBob: [opens up the wallet] Net ready, sir!
Krabs: [pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet] I did it! [gets excited] I finally did it!
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. [puts down the wallet to shake hands with Mr. Krabs, but the wallet starts bouncing away toward the back of the boat]
Krabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
SpongeBob: Huh?
Krabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! [SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat]
SpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!
Krabs: No! [dollar hops out of wallet and jumps like a dolphin away in the ocean]
SpongeBob: [grins nervously as Krabs glares at him] This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: [ties SpongeBob up with a rope tied to a plunger sticking out of a gun] You're fired! [Fires the gun, shooting the plunger and tossing SpongeBob with it]
SpongeBob: [screams as he gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building. The plunger is stuck onto a building.] Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: Zap! [zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out] I see you. [stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self] Zap! [shoots a green laser out of his eye]
Fred: My leg!
Plankton: I see you. Zap!
SpongeBob: Plankton! [tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle]
Plankton: I see you... [SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground] Zap! [zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on, then walks to the Krusty Krab. People continue to scream in panic] Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. [stomps on it] Crush! [picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it as if it were a lollipop and walks off] Lick, lick!
SpongeBob: This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary: Meow! Meow!
SpongeBob: [Stops and looks. Appears more and more worried.] Gary! Gary! No!
Gary: Meow! [Plankton still coming towards Gary making giant step sounds]
Plankton: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
SpongeBob: Gary! [jumps over to Gary and hugs him] I've got you, Gary!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! [steps on SpongeBob and Gary] Yeah! Huh? [lifts his foot from pain] Yow!
SpongeBob: [looking like a thumbtack] I think he's got the point. [laughs]
Plankton: [Starts shrinking.] Waaaaaah! [as he screams his voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal, puny size. Three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad] Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? [Burned Fred lifts his foot to step on him] No! No! No! Not the face! [gets squished. Wakes up screaming and his dream cloud pops, making dream SpongeBob fall to the ground]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping] Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. [goes to sleep] Ah... [wakes up after hearing his friends voices and faces hovering around his head]
Squidward: [his head starts circling SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [The heads of Mr Krabs, Sandy, Gary, Plankton, Pearl and Patrick start surrounding SpongeBob]
All: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tossing and turning in his sleep] What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! [Squidward taps him and he wakes up.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams, then sees his friends stand around his bed, except Patrick] Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
Squidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!
Sandy: Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!
All except Patrick: [grumble in agreement]
Plankton: Take a hike!
Squidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Gary: [In anger] Meow!
Patrick: [walks in] Does anyone have a quarter? [all stare at Patrick]


Mr. Krabs: [Looks around the Krusty Krab with a telescope] Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I'll surely break out in a rash!
SpongeBob: Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, I saw it first! Hah! [Jumps onto table and sweats] Mine, mine! Huh?!
SpongeBob: Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Where are the doubloons?
SpongeBob: [laughs] There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: "The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt".
Patrick: Based on a real treasure map.
SpongeBob: Take a break and play around with us.
Patrick: Yeah! C'mon, sweaty!
Mr. Krabs: Have you finished cleaning the tables?
SpongeBob: I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
SpongeBob: [chewing gum along with Patrick] I already took care of it.
Mr. Krabs: Hahaha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Five! [makes raspberry noise while moving piece. Reads card] One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm... [SpongeBob turns his eyes toward Mr. Krabs] It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Patrick, you're fired.
Patrick: But I don't even work here!
Mr. Krabs: Would you like a job, starting now? [puts hat on Patrick's head]
Patrick: Boy, would I!
Mr. Krabs: [takes hat off Patrick's head] You're fired.
SpongeBob: My turn. [rolls dice] One, two, three, four. [picks up card and reads it] Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way. [looks through the hole in the tree] Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Shiver me timbers!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
SpongeBob: [picks up card and reads it] You are a real pirate. Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Treasure. [digs and mini plastic treasure chest appears] There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. [starts sweating profusely]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
Fred: [walks into The Krusty Krab] Rev up those fryers, ‘cause I am sure hungry for one-- [Mr. Krabs picks him up, holds him over his head, and heads for the door]  Help! Help! [Mr. Krabs throws him out the door] My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Can't you see we're closed?! [rushes back to the game table] Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Six! One, two... [scenery changes from day to night. SpongeBob and Patrick are tired; Patrick is even asleep on the table] I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
SpongeBob: [very tired] I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. [he yawns, slings Patrick over his shoulder, and carries him out] See you tomorrow. [walks inside his house after bringing Patrick home. Rattling noises heard] Huh? Who's there? [turns light on]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
SpongeBob: [pushes Mr. Krabs outside] Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs. [closes door but Mr. Krabs is inside the house once again]
Mr. Krabs: Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you gotta...! [opens door, and Mr. Krabs is now outside]
Mr. Krabs: Tread softly, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: I'll roll for you, boy.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: One, two, three...
SpongeBob: [yelling in frustration] MR. KRABS! I WANNA GO TO BED!!! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
Mr. Krabs: A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? Though it is treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad. [SpongeBob shuts the door. Morning arrives, and then the rooster crows everyone up.] Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
SpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
SpongeBob: [excited] Pirates?
Mr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick appears from the side of SpongeBob's house] Treasure? [dancing around] We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip. [throws them a bag of pirate stuff] Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches!
Mr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
SpongeBob: [Walks towards the plank using two peg legs] Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! [falls on plank]
Patrick: [Walks towards the plank with two separate eye patches covering his eyes] And I'm BlindBeard the Pirate! [falls on SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh! [fade to ship sailing across in midair] Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
SpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... no. Only the captain can lay eyes on the map!
SpongeBob: Okie dokie, then!
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, "okie dokie, then!" A pirate says, "arrgh!"
SpongeBob: Okie... oops. [laughs while a jellyfish flies by him] I mean... [standing up] ARRGH, Captain Krabs. [eyes widen and sees a rock nearby] Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... ARRGH, Cap', ARRGH, we're, ARRGH, about, ARRGH, to hit, ARRGH...
Mr. Krabs: Out with it man, ARRGH!
Patrick: I, ARRGH, think, ARRGH, he's trying, ARRGH, to say-- [crash] land.
Mr. Krabs: AAAARRGH!!! From now on, only the captain says 'arrgh'! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater, captain.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh. We're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. [later] This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has... [Mr. Krabs pulls a leaf off] Which way, cap'n?
Mr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?
Patrick: Uhh... [pulls out a compass and visualizes it] let's see, uhh... [points] that way, captain!
Mr. Krabs: [cuts to the crew after walking] 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the "X"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east!
Patrick: Ohhhh, east? I thought you said "weast".
Mr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass are you reading lad?
Patrick: This one, sir.
Mr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. [cuts to the crew walking again] 9,551... 9,552...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
Patrick: And hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his cutlass, or by the size of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty of his crew. And without a loyal crew... [one of SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] what am I captain of? Just a... bunch of sand! [cries]
Patrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.
SpongeBob: [sniffles and crying] Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. [both cry]
Mr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!
Mr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
SpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one! [laying on ground at night outside tent]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
Patrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks!
SpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours!
Patrick: ...I know, hehehehe. [SpongeBob moves away]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [entering the tent] Captain Krabs?
SpongeBob: He's not here.
Patrick: Look! The treasure map.
SpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
Patrick: [walks toward the map] Yeah...
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: Nothing.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map. [Patrick touches the map]
Patrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?
SpongeBob: No, guess there isn't. [Both poking map. Map opens] Oops, Patrick, it opened by itself! [Both laugh. Eyes enlarge and search the map]
SpongeBob and Patrick: THE MAP! THE MAP! GOTTA SEE IT, GOTTA LOOK AT IT! [Eyes freeze for a second and then pop back in their heads.]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Patrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?
SpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
Mr. Krabs: [appearing right behind them and angry] Do you think this is a problem?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream] Ahh! Mr. Krabs!!
Mr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?
Patrick: We're sorry!
Mr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
SpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
Patrick: I think that.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
[SpongeBob and Patrick both begged in mercy and then the “X” symbol appeared underneath them.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Look! It's the "X".
Mr. Krabs: [eyes go into "X" like symbol] "X" marks the spot!
SpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map!
Mr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? [Spongebob and Patrick both start digging.] Dig! Dig! [minutes later] Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!
SpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha! Hand it up to me, lads! Heave! [Brings treasure up] We finally found it! [opens up the treasure chest]
Female Chorus: The Dutchman's Treasure!
All: Wow!
SpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
Patrick: I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
SpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!
SpongeBob: What about loyalty?
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Mr. Krabs: All for one!
SpongeBob: And one for all!
Mr. Krabs: All for one!!
SpongeBob: And one for all!!
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman...
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman... [wakes up] WHO DARES WAKE THE FLYING DUTCHMAN?! Keep it down, will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep. [noticing them fighting over treasure chest] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob and Patrick: And one for all. [Lightning]
Flying Dutchman: Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure???
Mr. Krabs: [shoves chest toward SpongeBob and Patrick] They did!
Flying Dutchman: Arrgh! [picks up the treasure chest] So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hugging each other in fear] Uh-huh!
Flying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.
[The Flying Dutchman giving them couple of gold doubloons]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Female Chorus: Two gold doubloons!
[SpongeBob and Patrick take the doubloons and the Flying Dutchman puts away his treasure chest in his pocket.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?
Flying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble. [Flicks something to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold! [a tiny plastic treasure chest] Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest!
Female Chorus: Plastic!
Flying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest! [laughs and disappears out of sight]
Patrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.
[Flying Dutchman turns into green smoke and vanishes.]


[At Glove World! Where SpongeBob and Patrick are standing outside the amusement park.]
SpongeBob: [Patrick is licking a glove-shaped lollipop] Another funtastic day at Glove World! [bus stops at the bus stop and both of them get in, but SpongeBob struggles for a bit with his balloon]
Bus Driver: Ahem. [points to coin deposit]
SpongeBob: Let me get my wallet. [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver's face] Wait, let me check this pocket. [turns around and the balloon hits him again] No... [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver again] Patrick? Do you have any change?
Patrick: How much do you need?
SpongeBob: How much is it?
Bus Driver: Fifty cents.
SpongeBob: [turns around and the balloon smacks the bus driver in the back of his head] Fifty cents.
Patrick: Nope.
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] Lemme check my other poc-
Bus Driver: Forget it!
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] What did you say?
Bus Driver: Just take your seat!
SpongeBob: Thanks, mister.
Bus Driver: Yeah, whatev- [SpongeBob turns around and balloon smacks him in the back of the head.]
Patrick: Show me what you got at Glove World!
SpongeBob: Okay! Here's my glove light. [turns on light]
Patrick: Wow...
SpongeBob: [puts light inside his head] I see you! [both laugh]
Patrick: I got gloves for my glove action-figure! [puts a tiny glove on the big glove's thumb]
SpongeBob: Cool! [Patrick looks out the window and notices a sign that says "You Are Now Leaving Bikini Bottom" as they drive past it]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [a tiny glove is on his nose] Yeah, Patrick?
Patrick: Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?
SpongeBob: Where did you see that?
Patrick: We just passed the sign. 'You are now in Leaving Bikini Bottom'.
SpongeBob: [gasps] What?! [looks out the window]
Patrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob? [driving past a sign that says "Bikini Bottom City Limits"]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think we're on the wrong... [Screams as bus drives down at a 90-degree angle road. SpongeBob and Patrick fly back and his the back of the bus] ...bus! [SpongeBob walks slowly up front. His face gets all distorted as he is moving closer. His pants rip off and fly at Patrick, but Patrick ducks in time. Then SpongeBob's underwear hits Patrick in the face. Bus comes to an immediate stop and both fly forward and hit the windshield. Then the balloon smacks the bus driver onto the windshield and all of them peel off. SpongeBob and Patrick are kicked off the bus] But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom.
Bus Driver: [hands balloon to SpongeBob] Oh, well. [drives bus away]
Patrick: What is this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [reads sign] Rock Bottom. [scroll over to a bus station] It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different. [picks up some green soil]
Green Soil: Do you... [raspberry] mind... [raspberry] putting me down? [SpongeBob shakes him off as he gasps]
Patrick: Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart! [bathroom doors have the "?" on one door and the "¿" on the other]
SpongeBob: Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know. [someone comes out the "¿" door. Patrick gasps] Maybe we should wait for one more. [a snake-like creature comes out of the "?" door. 3 creatures come out the "¿" door]
Patrick: I still can't read the sign! I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes. I'm gonna get a bus schedule. [walks off] Boy, this place sure is creepy. [bus drives by with Patrick's head sticking out the window]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here! [SpongeBob runs after the bus] SpongeBob...! [bus drives up the 90-degree angle road and SpongeBob tries to run up the road but falls down. Tries a couple more times but is unsuccessful]
SpongeBob: I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus. [puts on Grandpa disguise] Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle. [takes off disguise] I better go wait for the next one. [later, SpongeBob is standing by the bus stop sign with his glove balloon in his right hand] C'mon, bus! I've got to get home and feed Gary! [notices shoe untied and lets go of the balloon] Uh-oh, shoe's untied. [Puts foot on bus sign] Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over... [bus drives up and then drives off] and through the barrel. [later, wind is blowing SpongeBob's glove hat on his side so he puts it back. Wind blows balloon away] My balloon! [chases after balloon jumping for it when he gets the chance. A bus drives up and then drives off] Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus! Aww, not again! [throws hat down. Notices a creature with a red light on his head for an antenna] Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me? [the creature gives raspberry] Uhh, uhh, yeah, I... [creature runs after balloon] No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know when the next bus comes... [bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob runs after it, but decides to walk back to the bus stop sign] Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot no matter what! [SpongeBob's stomach growls] I'm gettin' hungry. Glove candy dispenser! Good thing I went to Glove World!. [squeezes out 6 tiny glove candies onto his tongue, then spits them out] Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that? [a Kandy Machine is shown across the road] A candy machine. [Rubs his tummy] Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. Mmm... [Checks each side of the road to see if a bus is coming] I'm not leaving this spot no matter what! [stomach growls] I'll only be gone a second. [runs over to the machine. While getting out a quarter, a bus drives up. Runs back across to bus] Hey! [bus drives off] Ooh! [stomach growls. Takes a few steps across the road and turns around to check for the bus. Takes a few more steps and checks again. Gets to the candy machine and takes out the quarter. Before inserting it, he checks for a bus. There's no bus so he puts in the quarter but a bus DOES come and drives off. Now he checks to his left down the road and decides to sprint across and get some candy. Pushes some buttons and checks for the bus. The candy is slowly coming down] Come on, come on! [candy drops to the bottom. SpongeBob grabs for it, but a bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob gets angry. He reaches for the candy but a bus comes up. Every time he reaches for the candy, the bus drives forward but when he pulls his arm away, the bus drives backwards. So he decides to leave the candy and run after the bus, but the bus drives off before he can get there. A creature comes up and takes the candy] Hey! That was mine! [walks over to the candy machine. 3 buses drives up and drive off while he's over there so he decides to run back. No more buses come, so he shakes the bus sign angrily] Barnacles! Alright, that's it! No more mister nice guy! [later, SpongeBob is at the candy machine staring at it and a bus drives up. Another SpongeBob tip-toes up, but the SpongeBob at the candy machine falls over revealing it to be made of wood. The bus drives off] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob is now a bench. A bus drives up, but drives off after it notices the SpongeBob bench] Fish paste! [walking into the bus station] I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom! I am first in line and no one is gonna tell me otherwise! [sees a giant green round creature standing behind him already in line] Okay, second! I am second in line! [sees another giant creature already in line] Okay, third is good! [another creature is already in line] Fourth, not bad. [Cut to SpongeBob at the end of the line behind a yellow creature] Okay, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it! [yellow creature spits out a giant egg on SpongeBob's head with the number 329 on it]
Window Attendant: Next. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Well, at least the line is moving. [everyone steps forward. Egg hatches 3 baby yellow creatures that jump in front of SpongeBob, thus making him now 331st in line. SpongeBob gets extremely angry. He lets out an angry growl.] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob hides inside his clothes and goes ballistic. Then comes out and everyone staring at him turns around]
Window Attendant: [time is going fast. raspberry] Next. [raspberry] Next. [raspberry. SpongeBob is sleeping] Next. [raspberry] Next.
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh?
Window Attendant: Next. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Finally! Yes, I'm next! [runs up to the window] When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?
Window Attendant: What? [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The bus schedule. The next bus.
Window Attendant: I can't... [raspberry] understand... [raspberry] your accent. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The next bus... [raspberry] to Bikini... [raspberry] Bottom. [long raspberry]
Window Attendant: Ohh. [raspberry] Why didn't you say so? [raspberry] Next bus leaves in... [raspberry] 5 seconds. [bus leaves] Ohh, tough luck, kid. [raspberry] That's the last one til' morning. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Oh, [raspberry] no... [raspberry] you don't! [raspberry]
Window Attendant: Goodnight! [puts closed sign up]
SpongeBob: Hold it, I'm not through here! [raspberry] Do you hear me? [raspberry] I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom right now! Until then, I am not leaving this spot! [gives 3 raspberries. Lights turn off. SpongeBob laughs nervously] Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light! [turns on light] Ah, that's better.
[The glove light stops working; short pause.]
SpongeBob: This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... advanced darkness. Hey! [closes eyes] If I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark.
[A raspberry is heard in the distance; he opens his eyes]
SpongeBob: Who's there?! [walks down the road] Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking. [hears another raspberry] Running! Better start running! Running! [hears another raspberry] Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting! [runs into the 90-degree angle road. Sits down with scallops flying around his head] Sitting, sitting. Bleeding. [hears noise] Hey, who's there? [hears another raspberry] Okay, that's enough! [hears another raspberry] Don't come closer! [hears another raspberry] I'm warning you! [hears another raspberry] I'm a sponge! [a red light shines around SpongeBob. It's the friendly creature from before that chased after the balloon] Oh, it's only you. [the creature ties balloon to SpongeBob's wrist] Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem. [the creature begins blowing balloon bigger] I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon... [raspberry] has... [raspberry] enough... [raspberry] air... [raspberry] thanks. [gives a few more raspberries as he is floating up] Hey, I get it, balloon travel! Thank... [raspberry] you! [raspberry]
Creature: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob, with the balloon still tied to his wrist, floats all the way back home] Ah, home at last. [balloon pops]
Patrick: [riding another bus to Rock Bottom] Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya!


SpongeBob: Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahhh, what a beautiful day! [SpongeBob's hand appears from a sand castle pineapple with his face drawn on his hand] I wonder if Patrick's at home.
Patrick: Hiya, SpongeBob! [Patrick's hand comes over from a sand castle rock with his face drawn on his hand] Whatcha doin'?
SpongeBob: Goin' over to Sandy's place. [both hands walk off together and arrive at a sand-made treedome] Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
Sandy: Don't lose your barnacles, boys. Hi-yah! [Chops sand castle peak down making a sand image of Texas] There it is!
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: Can't you see? It's Texas.
SpongeBob: Texas? What's a Texas? [a wave covers sand and ruins Sandy's Texas display]
Sandy: Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.
SpongeBob: All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.
Sandy: You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Sandy? Hi-yah!
Sandy: Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.
SpongeBob: Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy. [Turns around] Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah! [grabs Don the Whale from behind and flips him over onto the ground. Don growls like a dog and punches SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy? [surfs in the air] Surf's up, Sandy!
Sandy: No, thanks. [enters Jellyfish Fields. Jellyfish are heard buzzing]
SpongeBob: [Runs after a jellyfish with a net] Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing! [Patrick runs after one while laughing, then falls on his face. He gets up and runs again]
SpongeBob: Look, Sandy, we caught one!
Sandy: Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
Patrick: Fly away, little critter!
SpongeBob: Go on, go back to where you belong. [the jellyfish flies away as Sandy watches tearfully] Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home! [Sandy begins to cry, filling her helmet with tears. She takes out a flusher handle and attaches it to her helmet. She pulls it down and all her tears drain out. Sandy gasps for air and pants.]
SpongeBob: Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?
Sandy: I ain't crying! My helmet just sprung a leak!
SpongeBob: [suspicious] Sandy...
Sandy: [confessing] Oh, I guess I'm just feeling a little homesick.
SpongeBob: Homesick, huh? [SpongeBob thinks, and later, Sandy is blindfolded as SpongeBob and Patrick take her somewhere] Almost there.
Sandy: Heck gum it, SpongeBob, what is it?
SpongeBob: Da-ta-dah. [the three are standing outside the Treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Welcome home, Sandy!
[pause. Sandy cries and runs into the treedome.]
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: Go away. [pulls a lever which brings down a metal covering on the treedome]
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?
Patrick: Maybe it's just a squirrel thing. [a hole opens up in the top of the dome and Sandy comes out wearing a cowgirl hat and holding a guitar. Sandy tunes it]
Sandy: ♪Wish I was back in Texas. The ocean's no place for a squirrel.♪ [live action Texas scenery appears behind her] ♪Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world oh no. I guess that deep in my heart, I'll always be a Texas girl. I wanna go hooooooooooooooome, home.♪ [some clams howl along. SpongeBob and Patrick hear the music]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, do you hear that? [Patrick has the notes going around him]
Patrick: Arrrgh! Get them off me! Get them off me!
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy.
Sandy: ♪I wanna wake up in Texas.♪ [live action scenery is shown] ♪I miss those wide open skies. I miss my twenty acres, barbecues and pecan pies, oh, why? When I'm so far from you Texas, all I can do is cry.♪ [a live-action squirrel sheds a tear. SpongeBob and Patrick start sobbing. At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs hears the song, too, and starts sobbing also and accidentally gets hit by the cash register.]
Fish #1, #2, #3: Please Make It Stop! [Two customers are also sobbing; one dries his eyes with his Krabby Patty and gives it to the next person who blows his nose on it]
Sandy: ♪I wanna go hoooommme.♪ [Junior Brown's voice] ♪I wanna go home.♪ [as she sings she goes back into the Treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick continue sobbing and then stop]
Patrick: Do you think she knows the Muffin Man song?
SpongeBob: Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas.
Patrick: Well, let's go get some Texas and bring it down here!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing!
Patrick: [mishears, and frantically covers himself] Where?
[Later, SpongeBob and Patrick have gotten everything ready at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now.
Mr. Krabs: [from inside] Well, hurry up, lads! We can't squat like this forever!
[at Sandy's house where SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are playing leapfrog while going to her treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Sandy's surprise is at the Krusty Krab!
Patrick: Wait until she sees the...
SpongeBob: Shh! Don't spoil the surprise! [SpongeBob knocks, Sandy opens her door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, Sandy!
SpongeBob: You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [walks out with two suitcases] Hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob: What are you doing with those bags?
Sandy: I'm going back home to Texas.
SpongeBob: What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we...
Sandy: It's time for this tumbleweed to tumble on home.
SpongeBob: Wait, Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: I'm tired of fish food, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, don't you want to say goodbye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [gets on a bus] I just can't do that, SpongeBob. It'd be too sad.
SpongeBob: No, no! Wait! Sandy! [the bus drives off] I can't believe she's gone.
Patrick: Yeah. What's so great about dumb ol' Texas? [the bus suddenly speeds back; the doors open revealing a very angry Sandy]
Sandy: What did you say?
Patrick: Texas is dumb?
Sandy: [the bus drives off again] Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain!
SpongeBob: You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?
Sandy: No, you can't!
Patrick: Then can we say people from Texas are dumb?
Sandy: No! You can't say nothing about Texas!
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about... [turns around; grabs his behind and shakes it and rolls eyes] Texas!
Sandy: [blushes angrily] I'm warnin' you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all!
Patrick: I'm Texas, too! Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
SpongeBob: Howdy y'all!
Patrick: Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
Sandy: Y'all best cut it out!
SpongeBob: [while Patrick does armpit farts] The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas! [Sandy gets steaming mad. SpongeBob turns into the shape of Texas] Hey, Patrick, what am I now?
Patrick: Uhh, stupid?
SpongeBob: No, I'm Texas!
Patrick: What's the difference?! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Sandy: [drops suitcases] Y'all best apologize, or I'm gonna be on you like ugly on an ape!
SpongeBob: You'll have to catch us first! [SpongeBob and Patrick run off] We did it! We got her!
Patrick: Krusty Krab, here we come! [turns head around to Sandy] Can we say that plants from Texas are dumb? Can we say that shoes from Texas are dumb?
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, that's enough.
Patrick: Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna... [...catch up, which she is. And fast. Patrick's eyes bug out and he screams]
SpongeBob: Run faster, Patrick! [both of them scream; they go around each side of a huge rock. Sandy crashes right through the rock, obliterating it, and walks with a twirling rope. Her shoe engulfs the screen, Sandy ropes Patrick and brings him into the background]
Patrick: [screams] SpongeBob! [Nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears. SpongeBob screams. SpongeBob stops in front of a leaf and shakes as Sandy karate chops the leaf and SpongeBob in half]
Sandy: Hi-yah! [SpongeBob jumps with his halves and he gets back together] Y'all gonna take back what ya said!
SpongeBob: No! Almost there! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. Sandy's rope turns into the shape of SpongeBob; SpongeBob screams. As he jumps for the Krusty Krab, Sandy throws her rope. SpongeBob hangs onto the door as Sandy pulls him towards her]
Sandy: SpongeBob, you've been messing with the bull! Now here come the horns!
SpongeBob: Sandy, no! [the front of the Krusty Krab tears off as Sandy has pulled tight enough]
Everyone: Howdy, y'all!
Sandy: Wha-what's this?
SpongeBob: It's a party!
Patrick: [hops over with arms and legs tied and covered in bandages] For you!
Sandy: For me?!
SpongeBob: It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out, Sandy! We got square dancing... [Flats is holding a square] ...giant Barbecues... [Squidward is holding a sharp, spiky Q]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: ...homemade peas-in-a-can pie... [Pearl is holding a pie with a can of peas in it] ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats! [SpongeBob and Patrick put ten gallon water jugs on their heads] So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?
[Sandy starts to laugh and tears of laughter spew out and fill her helmet. Everyone frowns as tears start to well up in SpongeBob and Patrick's eyes']
SpongeBob: Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags.
Sandy: [takes out the flusher handle, attaches it to her helmet and flushes the water out again] I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya. [Everyone gathers around Sandy]
Sandy: Huh? Duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.
SpongeBob: Does that mean you'll stay?
Sandy: I'm staying! [Everyone cheers, except Squidward]
SpongeBob: That makes me feel all wiggly.
Patrick: Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas? [cheering stops; cut back to the Bikini Atoll]
Sandy: What did you just say?!
Patrick: Should I start running now?


[metallic roaring]
Plankton: [enters Goo Lagoon and he uses his bulldozer to remove the sign. He leaves his bulldozer] Attention, beach-goers! You are trespassing! You have exactly 17 minutes to haul your carcasses off the future site of the [puts up a sign] 'Chum Bucket Mega Bucket.' [he makes a loud squeaking noise that catches some of the beachgoers' attention]
Tina: Do you hear something? [Peterson doesn't hear anything, and he shakes his head "no." The Lifeguard thinks the sound is coming from his megaphone, looks inside it and then turns it upside-down and shakes it.]
Plankton: [takes out megaphone] Okay, have it your way. I don't mind bulldozing over each and every one--
Billy: [grabs Plankton's bulldozer] Mommy, look! Somebody left this toy tractor here.
Evelyn: Put that down, Billy, that has germs on it.
Billy: [drops the bulldozer] Aw, mom.
Plankton: [talks through megaphone] You'll see. [throws away the megaphone] You'll all see! The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretinous beachgoers. But it's becoming increasingly obvious... I can deny it no longer... [zoom out] I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need... [giant foot almost steps on Plankton but he dives out of the way] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Plankton: Yes. He's the one. [laughs evilly. The sand on his head falls off]
SpongeBob: I'll have one... [some kid cuts in front of him]
Monroe: Two, please. [Lou gives him two ice creams] Thanks. [walks off]
SpongeBob: One, please. [Electric Eel slithers through SpongeBob and grabs the ice cream]
Eel: 'Scuse me. [walks off licking the ice cream]
SpongeBob: One, please.
Lou: Sorry, kid. We're all out.
SpongeBob: Aww, barnacles. [he hears crying coming from Plankton, who's sitting on a bench with two ice creams] Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?
Plankton: Oh, hi, SpongeBob. [blows his nose] I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one! [cries] I don't know what to do with the other one! [SpongeBob is confused; Plankton cries then stops for a second and looks at SpongeBob and cries again.]
SpongeBob: I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.
Plankton: SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?
SpongeBob: Sure! [starts to lick the ice cream]
Plankton: SpongeBob... [SpongeBob is still licking the ice cream] SpongeBob? [SpongeBob eats the whole ice cream and is now licking what's left inside. Plankton uses his megaphone to get SpongeBob's attention] SPONGEBOB!!!
SpongeBob: [turns towards Plankton] Yeah? [spits out ice cream as he talks]
Plankton: Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance. [SpongeBob licks his fingers] You can have anything you want with a little training. [SpongeBob licks his fingers again]
SpongeBob: Training?
Plankton: Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.
SpongeBob: Assertive, huh?
Plankton: That's right.
SpongeBob: Anything I want. [licks his lips] Sounds great! [spits more ice cream at Plankton when talking]
Plankton: Wonderful. [laughs evilly then SpongeBob joins in the laughing. Then an adult fish sits on SpongeBob] SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!
SpongeBob: Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face.
Plankton: No, no, be assertive! [SpongeBob puts his fingers in the guy's pockets]
SpongeBob: ...beep, beep! [Plankton facepalms]
Plankton: NOT INSERTIVE! [adult fish checks his watch, then walks away] SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!
SpongeBob: But I'm a spo...
Plankton: Don't say it! [Plankton spots the eel that took SpongeBob's ice cream] There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?
SpongeBob: Ice cream! [Plankton gets up and runs behind Electric Eel]
Plankton: Listen, you! My friend's got something to say! [Electric Eel turns around]
Eel: What, who said that? [talks to SpongeBob] Was it you?
Plankton: Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!
SpongeBob: That's my ice cream cone!
Plankton: Great! Now let him have it!
SpongeBob: [misunderstanding what Plankton means] You can have it.
Eel: Say, thanks! [walks off]
Plankton: No! [jumps inside SpongeBob's mouth] I'll show ya how! [voicing for SpongeBob, SpongeBob stands still.] Hey, pencil neck! [Electric Eel turns around] Yeah, you... slither over here! [Electric Eel walks over to SpongeBob] Surrender that ice cream cone, or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery! [Electric Eel looks scared; he throws the ice cream onto SpongeBob's face and runs away crying]
SpongeBob: Hey, that guy was crying!
Plankton: Those were tears of joy! He was happy that you were assertive!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Plankton: You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.
Plankton: Whatever.
SpongeBob: Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it! [throws ice cream on  his tongue, hitting Plankton who is still on it. Later, he is using a metal detector, and it beeps] I found something!
Scooter Like Fish: Uhh, excuse me, my metal detector broke. Can I use yours? [SpongeBob hands the equipment to him]
SpongeBob: Sure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!
SpongeBob: [misunderstands] Hey, do you want to take a hike with me?
Scooter Like Fish: Yeah!
Plankton: [angry] ...NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!
SpongeBob: [sees a ditch] Hey! Go check in that ditch! [points to the ditch beside them. The fish jumps down in the ditch and finds a treasure chest]
Scooter Like Fish: Wow! Buried treasure! Thanks!
SpongeBob: Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!
SpongeBob: Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!
Fish: But I'm wearing sandals!
SpongeBob: Okay, never mind! [Plankton jumps off of SpongeBob] It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?
Plankton: [putting things into a suitcase] Oh, nothing, SpongeBob. [puts on a black hat] I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.
SpongeBob: No it's not!
Plankton: Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.
SpongeBob: But what about airline food?
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night! [rimshot] See, I can be a stand-up guy. See? [Plankton throws his hat down]
Plankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!
Plankton: Okay, but this is your last chance! [points to people trying to get a tan] Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?
SpongeBob: Just watch me! [runs over and waves a blanket up and down and builds up sand to make the beach-goers run away] Man, this thing is sandy!
Fred: My leg! [after everyone runs off, SpongeBob is laying on his back with a funnel acting as a sunlamp]
Plankton: Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach! [SpongeBob now has a tan and looks brown] SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?
SpongeBob: Well, not all of me.
Hot Dog Man: Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
Plankton: Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!
SpongeBob: I'll do better than that! [he stretches his tongue to eat everybody's hotdogs]
Plankton: SpongeBob, that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!
SpongeBob: What?
Plankton: Breaking your wind! [SpongeBob uses one of his teeth to boomerang it into cutting the strings off the kites]
Larry: Hey, SpongeBob, throw us the ball! [SpongeBob pops the volleyball and trumpets like an elephant. Everybody leaves the beach]
SpongeBob: Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male! [sees Plankton missing] Plankton? [Plankton is driving a crane] Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!
Plankton: Exactly.
SpongeBob: You didn't tell me everyone would leave.
Plankton: Oops. [he presses a button in his crane, and the "Mega Bucket" sign comes out from the ground]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mega Bucket?! You used me... FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT! [voice cracks] That wasn't nice!
Plankton: Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: Well, what about aggressively nice people?
Plankton: Huh? What are you doing?! [SpongeBob brings out the hot dogs he ate earlier and puts them back where they belong. Then he puts the kites back where they were] Wait, SpongeBob! Stop! [a girl is crying because she has sand on her ice cream. SpongeBob takes it and wipes the sand off with his eyelashes] Butterfly kisses... can't take it... it's too cute... it's disgusting! [Scooter is crying at his broken surfboard]
SpongeBob: What happened? [points to surfboard]
Scooter: I hit a reef with my new board, dude!
SpongeBob: No problem! [makes himself a surfboard]
Scooter: Whoa! [grabs the surfboard] Killer!
Plankton: SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back! [everyone comes back] Wait! [everyone steps on Plankton. He is squished. Scooter is surfing]
Scooter: Cowabunga! Thanks, dude! That was awesome!
SpongeBob: Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket.
Plankton: Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting. [bunches up into a ball] NEED... HATRED... [crawls away]
SpongeBob: Volleyball, anyone? [everyone uses SpongeBob as the ball] Serve up! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch!


[the episode begins with Gary snoring and meowing]
SpongeBob: Wake up, Gary.
Gary: [wakes up] Meow?
SpongeBob: We're moving today!
Gary: [quizzically] Meow?
SpongeBob: That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants! [puts on a hat and fake beard]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [He takes away Gary's bowl] No more food. [gives Gary a plate with clams on it] Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells. [SpongeBob puts salt in the shells, and Gary starts crying] April Fools! [takes off the outfit and puts Gary's food bowl back onto the floor] There ya go, pal!
Gary: Meow. [eats]
SpongeBob: [goes into the kitchen] Whew, I'm thirsty! [takes a big glass of lemonade out of the fridge] [male voice] This is an extreme thirst! [sets the lemonade down on the floor; bubble transition to him putting all the lemonade into a lot of small glasses with umbrellas]
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!! [holds up a mirror] ...To me! [laughs obnoxiously and walks outside and towards work. Squidward sees him]
Squidward: What's he so happy about? [walks by the calendar and notices it's April Fools Day. He panics] April 1st? [screams] April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday! [puts a heating pad on his head and dials the number for the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today, I caught something terrible.
Mr. Krabs: [over phone] What'd ya catch?
Squidward: I caught sight of the calendar.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.
[Squidward runs to the Krusty Krab with an artist uniform on]
Squidward: I have arrived. [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh] What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh more]
Mr. Krabs: You just missed him.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but he told us to tell you...
Squidward: Tell me what?
SpongeBob: [whispers into Squidward's ear] He told me to tell you... April Fools.
Squidward: [lays his hat on the table] Well, it's been nice working here. [he walks off] Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait!
Squidward: Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward! [grabs Squidward's legs] It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!
Squidward: You do?
SpongeBob: Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?
[Mr. Krabs sits on a whoopee cushion and it "farts." SpongeBob laughs]
Squidward: Well, as long as it's not me.
[bubble transition to SpongeBob carrying a tray of burger patties when an old lady comes by]
Miss Shell: Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?
SpongeBob: They're riiiight here, lady! [leads her to the utensils]
Miss Shell: [picks up a spoon] But, this is a spoon...
SpongeBob: APRIL FOOLS! [laughs; Squidward stares at SpongeBob and he runs away; bubble transition to SpongeBob behind the register; a customer comes up to him] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?
Nat: [raises up his left arm] Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [points at something] Hey, what's that?
[Nat turns around; SpongeBob turns around and has a smiley face on his back]
Nat: Well, I didn't see anything... [notices that SpongeBob is gone] hey, where'd that other guy go?
[SpongeBob turns around]
SpongeBob: April Fools!! I'm right here!!
Nat: [laughs] Hey, that was pretty good.
[SpongeBob laughs obnoxiously; Squidward notices SpongeBob behind the register]
Squidward: What are you doing behind the counter?
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob wiping the floor; Tom comes by with a cup of soda]
Tom: Excuse me, can I get a couple of ice cubes in here, please?
SpongeBob: Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up! [fills the cup with ice and comes back whistling] Here you go.
Tom: Thanks. [he takes a sip of his drink; SpongeBob titters and Tom looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before Tom turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom takes another sip of his drink; SpongeBob starts giggling again and then Tom turns around and looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before he turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom finishes his drink] Ah.
SpongeBob: [laughs loudly and obnoxiously] April Fools! [Tom grabs SpongeBob by the collar, suddenly panicked]
Tom: WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY DRINK?!
SpongeBob: I... [giggles] I... [giggles]
Tom: YOU WHAT?!?!
SpongeBob: You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one! [laughs]
Tom: I guess that is pretty funny! [laughs as he walks off]
SpongeBob: [laughs so hard his tongue pops off] Hey, your shoes untied. [tongue looks down] April Fools! You're not wearing shoes! [laughs and hugs his tongue, which smiles. Then they laugh into the microphone; everyone hears it; in the kitchen, Squidward tries to mute the sound with tissues, but he can still hear it] APRIL FOOOOOLS! [Squidward drops a plate]
Squidward: That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about! [bubble transition to him squirting some mustard inside a rope circle then he chuckles and shows SpongeBob the mess]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up! [starts cleaning it and Squidward is standing next to a rope which he is about to cut]
Squidward: APRIL FOOLS! [laughs as he cuts the rope which grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Whooaahh! [the rope sends him into a bag of flour. Squidward is laughing through all of this and rolls on the floor. Then SpongeBob is taken around a bar] Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl... [screams as he is sent slamming face-first into the wall]
Customers: Oh, no!
[Squidwards eyes pop out as he laughs hysterically. SpongeBob screams and flies into Bubble Bass' rear]
SpongeBob: Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [Cut to Squidward cheerleading, laughing, and jumping into the air. Then SpongeBob smashes into the ceiling]
Squidward: [runs and holds out his arms to catch SpongeBob] I'll catch you, SpongeBob! [he giggles to himself. SpongeBob screams as he plummets toward Squidward, who quickly sets out a garbage can in front of him, and SpongeBob falls into the goop in the can] Oops. [dumps SpongeBob, who is now the shape of the can, out of the garbage can] April Fools, you little sausage! [he laughs]
SpongeBob: ...Ohhh!&#160;:( [SpongeBob sobs hysterically and runs out of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You all know I was just kidding… Right?
Wobbles: Aww, man, poor kid.
Shubie: That guy has definitely got some issues to work out. [The customers angrily glare at Squidward as they begin to leave]
Olive green fish: April Fools... jerk. [All the customers storm out the door in disgust] 
Squidward: Wait, don't go!
Man: Hey, you stink!
Squidward: Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh... [looks around at the mess he has made and winces, then he looks at Bubble Bass, who has a hole in his bottom due to the "prank" and Squidward starts to feel ashamed of himself] Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach. [makes silly face] Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo- [throat goes haywire] gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought. [bubble transition to Squidward going to SpongeBob's pineapple; he knocks on SpongeBob's door] SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob? [notices a Krusty Krab hat and goes over there to talk to the man who is wearing it] Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do, so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am... What? [notices that the guy with the hat on is Patrick] Patrick? What are you doing here?
Patrick: Digging.
Squidward: Why are you wearing that hat?
Patrick: Hmm, I don't know. [takes off the hat]
Squidward: [growls] Where's SpongeBob?
Patrick: He's in the house. He's impressed.
Squidward: With what?
Patrick: I don't know, but it must've been pretty good to make him cry like that.
Squidward: [shivers then goes back to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there! [tries to turn the handle, but SpongeBob's arm comes from under the door and pulls it inside; Squidward grabs his clarinet] SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this! [plays clarinet horribly. SpongeBob opens the door]
SpongeBob: What do you want?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. [sticks out tongue while talking]
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: I'm trying to say I'm [turns into a donkey and starts braying] hee-haw-hee-haw!
SpongeBob: What?!
Squidward: I'm just trying to say that I'm... [head explodes] There's gotta be an easier way to do this. [bubble transition to Squidward writing a note; he puts it in a bottle and rolls it to SpongeBob where he picks it up] Well, aren't you going to open it?
SpongeBob: I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.
Squidward: Doh! [Squidward hands SpongeBob a can and Squidward drives to the other side of the road] SpongeBob, I'm... [whispers into the can, then puts the can up to his ear but hears some sort of noise; Patrick is flossing his teeth with the cord; Squidward growls and throws the binoculars down on the ground] SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am... [waves tentacles in the air and bubbles form, puts a big bubble on his head and then talks] ...sorry. [pops the bubble] There you go.
SpongeBob: But I couldn't... [Squidward slams the door in his face]
Squidward: I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear! [Starts to walk away, when an image of Patrick appears in the air]
Patrick: It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that. [Squidward nervously continues walking and runs into a ghost image of a guy at the Krusty Krab]
Tom: April Fools, jerk. [Squidward frantically starts running again, but this time his mother appears]
Mrs. Tentacles: [male voice] YOU STINK!
Squidward: Mother? [runs back to SpongeBob's house to apologize] All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and... [SpongeBob opens the door slightly]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Is all that true?
Squidward: Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.
SpongeBob: Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
Squidward: What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.
SpongeBob: I promise.
Squidward: Really? [SpongeBob opens the door all the way, revealing the citizens of Bikini Bottom inside]
Everyone: April Fools!
Squidward: [twitches eye] April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all! [laughs hysterically while going back into his house]
SpongeBob: What would we do without Squidward?


[SpongeBob Patrick are browsing through Fry Cook Museum making noises at every rare item they see]
SpongeBob: Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula! [Larry tries to pull the spatula out]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look what it says here. [reads plaque] Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease, but all have failed.
Larry: [Makes a straining noise after the golden spatula springs back.]
SpongeBob: Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...the golden spatula. Wow!
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula! [SpongeBob runs up to the spatula and holds it] Okay, I'm ready! [Patrick is about to take a picture]
Miss Shell: Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is? [Patrick gets confused and drools]
Patrick: Uh!
SpongeBob: Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way. [SpongeBob pulls the spatula out and gray clouds appear above him] Uh-oh.
Miss Shell: [deep voice] Holy smokes! [runs away]
Patrick: Rude. Hey, the light changed.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick...
Patrick: [lightning bolts strike] Hold on, almost there. [clouds open to a mysterious figure comes out that is known as]
King Neptune: Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.
King Neptune: A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge. [SpongeBob goes droopy each time he is insulted] Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny! [laughs] Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook. [searches for the real spatula taker] No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no... [soon comes up to a hot dog stand] Ah! 
SpongeBob: But, but...
King Neptune: A purveyor of foods. [chuckles] Yes, you must be my new fry cook.
Hot Dog Vendor: Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them.
King Neptune: Then who pulled out the spatula?
Hot Dog Vendor: [scoffs at Neptune] Uh, he did. [points to SpongeBob]
King Neptune: [everyone laughs] It is even funnier a second time! [destroys the hot dog stand with his fist] You there, crustacean!
Larry: Who, me?
King Neptune: You have the physique of Atlas!
Larry: [laughs] Thanks, I work out.
King Neptune: [laughs] Make poses with me!
Larry: Okay!
Larry and King Neptune: [show off their muscles] Body slam! [body slams each other]
King Neptune: You pulled the spatula from the grease!
Larry: Nope, that was SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob smiles]
King Neptune: This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook? [everyone runs except Patrick] Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know who can flip a burger to suit a royal palate! [Patrick points to SpongeBob] What? Am I expected to believe this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof? [Patrick shows the photo he took of SpongeBob holding the spatula] Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.
SpongeBob: Like?
King Neptune: The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.
SpongeBob: Actually, I've got two. [shows two left hands]
King Neptune: [snaps fingers] Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear. [SpongeBob shows his red underwear] No, blue. [SpongeBob shows his blue underwear] Uh, the royal fry cook's wallet contains... [SpongeBob takes out his wallet] His big toes are... [SpongeBob gets ready to show something about his foot] Uhh, he has six...
Patrick: [contemptuously mocks Neptune] He is the new royal fry cook and you...
King Neptune: [shouting] Silence! [Patrick gets zapped]
Patrick: Is it hot in here or what? [falls over]
SpongeBob: [gasp] Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!
King Neptune: [grabs SpongeBob] So, little one, you think you have what it takes to be my fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!
Patrick: [faint, down below] [mocks Neptune again] Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any... [Patrick gets zapped again] Ouch.
King Neptune: Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.
Patrick:  [mocks Neptune again] Only two? What are two challenges to someone like Sponge- [Patrick gets zapped again]
King Neptune: Three challenges!
Patrick: Three? [laughs contemptuously] [mocks Neptune with sarcasm] Three challenges is nothing. It might as well be 500 challenges! [Patrick gets zapped again]
King Neptune: Enough! [Patrick gets zapped into a dust pile]
Patrick: He'll settle for one.
King Neptune: There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!
SpongeBob: I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
King Neptune: Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him. [Patrick gets zapped to normal]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! [turns around as we see that his face is now on the bottom of his body above his legs] SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!
SpongeBob: How you feeling?
Patrick: Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?
King Neptune: And now, see the fate that may lie ahead. [summons the clouds] For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great. [opens the clouds] Behold! [shows Tom Kenny taking a shower and he screams; Neptune quickly closes the portal and chuckles sheepishly] Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold! [opens the clouds again and shows the city of Atlantis] My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!
Patrick: Hey, that sounds pretty good.
King Neptune: But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?
SpongeBob: I'm ready.
King Neptune: Very well then. To the Poseidome! [At the Poseidome]
Mr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off! [Everyone cheers] All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.[King Neptune and SpongeBob shake hands. SpongeBob's arm disintegrates]
SpongeBob: [regrows his hand] May the best man win.
Mr. Krabs: Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking! [talking to SpongeBob] Don't worry, lad, I have total confidence in you. [Mr. Krabs has a lot of money in his hands] Put it all on Neptune!
SpongeBob: I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.
Patrick: Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: "Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds." Well, just look at me now. [bell dings] Go get 'em, tiger! [King Neptune starts making his Krabby Patties and so does SpongeBob.]
[King Neptune makes his very quickly with help from sea creatures and his magic. SpongeBob takes his time going through each important step to make sure his patty comes out right. King Neptune summons large amounts of wheat from the ground and zaps them into buns.]
[King Neptune summons the vegetables, and summons the swordfish to slice them all. SpongeBob makes sure a tomato is perfectly aligned. He carefully slices the tomato with the golden spatula.]
[King Neptune zaps the patties, while SpongeBob rubs sticks to create a fire. King Neptune uses magic to flip hundreds of patties. SpongeBob patiently waits for the patty to cook above the campfire.]
[King Neptune uses magic to assemble the hundreds of burgers that appear like Krabby Patties. King Neptune laughs while the burgers rain down. SpongeBob puts ketchup on two pickles to apply faces on them. He applies a cheese "blanket," kisses a pickle.]
SpongeBob: [reading a bedtime story to the pickles] Once upon a time...
[King Neptune still laughs, while the burgers assemble in a square-based pyramid. SpongeBob puts the top bun on his one Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Perfect!
[In the end, the score is King Neptune: 1000 and SpongeBob: 1]
King Neptune: I win! [everyone cheers but SpongeBob] Loser! [Chuckles] Free patties for everyone! [everyone chews a bite out of the patties that King Neptune made and they spit it out immediately] Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious! [sniffs one] Ooh.
Audience: [Everyone complains different complaints that King Neptune needs to try one of his burgers] You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!
King Neptune: [throws his burger out] Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better? [King Neptune grabs a patty from SpongeBob] Give me that! [King Neptune eats it and begins to like it] Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time! [King Neptune spits it out and eats it again; the crowd groans in disgust.]
SpongeBob: So, uhh, what do you think?
King Neptune: Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win. [everyone cheers]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Yeah! [both dancing] We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis! [King Neptune laughs]
SpongeBob: What's so funny?
King Neptune: You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?
SpongeBob: You mean, Patrick can't come?
King Neptune: [laughs] No, of course not.
SpongeBob: And my friends?
King Neptune: Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.
Patrick: [crying and wiping his tears with a tissue] It was nice knowing you, buddy!
SpongeBob: [Mr Krabs cries] I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too.
Mr. Krabs: I lost me bet!
King Neptune: Come, SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart... [a two-seater bike appears] to Atlantis![rings bell]
SpongeBob: I... I... [cries] I don't wanna go!
King Neptune: It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it! [King Neptune zaps SpongeBob and he becomes a muscular god. But being the same size, he looks a little strange] Maybe we do have a problem.
SpongeBob: [in a booming voice] Wait, Neptune! I have another idea! [Patrick walks in the Krusty Krab still looking the same when King Neptune changed him back to normal but with his face on the bottom]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. What'll you have? [Patrick drools stupidly then SpongeBob hears King Neptune shout] Can you excuse me?
King Neptune: The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thine own wrath, stove! [uses his powers to zap the stove] Haha!
SpongeBob: What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?
King Neptune: [Sighs. Embarrassedly puts arms behind his back.] Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic. [SpongeBob smiles]


Narrator: Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends. [shows fishermen in boats fishing near the Bikini Bottom atoll]
Squidward: SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
SpongeBob: Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table 9. [uses himself as a cleaning tool]
Mr. Krabs: They're back! They're back, I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes! [everyone looks at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] The hooks! The hooks!
Fred: How about a mint?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! The hooks!
Tom: Can you make that to go?
Squidward: [gives Tom his food in a bag] You don't know how lucky you are.
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! So there I was, minding my own business...
Squidward: I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, uhmmm... I have to do my waste basket inspection. [puts a trashcan on his head] Uh-huh, mmhmm, oh, yeah, there's one.
Mr. Krabs: Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya!
SpongeBob: Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks, me bucko! They're back. Beware the hooks!
SpongeBob: The hooks?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. [shapes his arm like a hook as SpongeBob looks at his arm] The hooks. [The camera shows SpongeBob's face with a reflection with Mr. Krabs' arm as a hook] They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches... [grabs Scooter's pants and lifts high like he is giving him a wedgie. His drink decreases every time Mr. Krabs grabs his pants as he sips it] ...and haul you way up high! Then higher, AND HIGHER, AND HIGHER [he opens a hatch on the roof and points at the surface] until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath! And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya... or worse!
SpongeBob: [gasps] What could be worse than that?!
Mr. Krabs: Gift shops. [shows gift shop and the inside of the gift shop]
SpongeBob: [gasps and hides under a box] Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen! Time is money!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs! [goes in the kitchen with the box on him]
Patrick: [pokes his head through one of the kitchen windows] Gooooood morning, Krusty Crew.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go!
SpongeBob: I can't leave now. I'm working.
Patrick: It's not leaving. You're just taking a break. [SpongeBob goes outside behind unseen] We're going to the carnival, we're going to the carni... [trips and falls on face] We're going to the carnival, we're going to the carnival! There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town! [many hooks are dangling] I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
SpongeBob: Where is everybody?
Patrick: I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier. [a pair of kids' sneakers lie on the ground nearby]
SpongeBob: Doesn't look like any carnival I ever... [bumps into a hook] Excuse me. [gasps as he sees the hook as the camera shows SpongeBob's face again with the reflection with a hook] Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks! Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!
Patrick: [sits on a hook] Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese.
SpongeBob: All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!
[Patrick is putting the cheese in his mouth]
Patrick: Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it! [the hook where Patrick ate the cheese from is pulled up]
SpongeBob: [faces another hook with cheese attached to it] But, Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: SpongeBob, let me ask you something. [the hook that SpongeBob is facing is pulled up. Patrick is shown with 9 hooks in his mouth and still has 1 in his hand] Does this look dangerous?
SpongeBob: [screams] Patrick, don't!
Patrick: Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... [hooks pulls him up]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back! Oh, my best friend! [Patrick floats down and SpongeBob runs into him as he hits the ground] Patrick, you're alive!
Patrick: Am I ever! You should try it.
SpongeBob: But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?
Patrick: You just jump off before you go up too high.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
Patrick: Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? [he jumps on a fish-like attachment on the hook]
SpongeBob: Well, no.
Patrick: Wheeee!
SpongeBob: I guess he didn't! [he jumps on the attachment with Patrick]
Patrick: Hi-yo, Silverfish! AWAYYYYYY!!!! [The hook pulls them up. We see a fisherman reeling in his fishing rod. We see SpongeBob and Patrick laughing out of enjoyment. The camera alternates between the fisherman and his partner to SpongeBob and Patrick. After a few cuts, SpongeBob and Patrick are about to jump off]
SpongeBob: Ready?
Patrick: Ready!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Geronimo!! [jump off]
SpongeBob: This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab! [On the surface, the fishermen are having a smoke break, disappointed at having lost their catch. Cut to the exterior at the Krusty Krab when customers are muttering angrily. We cut to see Ivy mad with Harold]
Ivy: P.U.! [points at his Krabby Patty] You call this food?!
Harold: My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!
Another Harold: [Starts holding up his fried boot] My sandwich is a fried boot!
Fred: Hurry it up, will ya?! We're hungry over here! Look at us! My kids haven't eaten and I'm dying! [customers muttering angrily... all talking at once; Squidward frantically flipping burnt patties] That's not how you're supposed to flip it!
Fish: Can you see, we're hungry! That's wrong!
Female Fish: I want a nice good meal!
Squidward: [defensive] WHY DO YOU WANNA EAT THIS STUFF ANYWAY?!?
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
Squidward: It's a feeding frenzy, sir! And SpongeBob's not back from his break. [Mr. Krabs laughs] What?
Mr. Krabs: I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taken a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59. [laughs] Now, what were you saying?
Squidward: He took a break.
Mr. Krabs: [stares in shocked silence, as his arms and nose fall off. He then storms out the front door] Alright, SpongeBob LAZY Pants! I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues. [uses his nose to smell] Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget!
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I still need help! [all the customers pick up Squidward like they are a mob]
Mr. Krabs: [uses his nose to smell again] They should be right here. [SpongeBob and Patrick float down as they are laughing]
Patrick: Again?
SpongeBob: Again!
Mr. Krabs: The hooks!! No! No! No!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [pulling on hook] 1, 2, 3!
Mr. Krabs&#160;: Wait! WAIT...!!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Blastoff!! [hook pulls them up as Mr. Krabs slams into a rock]
Mr. Krabs: Boys! I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [sobs] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd... [SpongeBob and Patrick float back down while laughing] ...I'D THROTTLE 'EM! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
SpongeBob: I...I...I...
Patrick: I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride 'em up, and up, and up. Then you gently flow down!
Mr. Krabs: And do you know what happens when you don't float back down!?!
SpongeBob: Gift shop?
Mr. Krabs: Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna! [shows a can of tuna] With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise! [shows a jar of mayo while a female screams in the background]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [raises hands] We promise, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I need a sailor's promise! Repeat after me: yo-ho! Yo-ho! Near the hooks I'll never go!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yo-ho. Yo-ho. Near the hooks we'll never go.
[a hook pokes Mr. Krabs in the butt]
Mr. Krabs: [leaps up, holding his injured rear] YOW! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahh! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck! [they turn and rub their own behinds]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa, whew! Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. [Cuts to the exterior of SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'M READY! [comes running out of the house] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready, I'm ready... [Patrick comes out from his rock]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way! [crashes into his furniture]
SpongeBob: I always go to work this way.
Patrick: You're not going to work today. We're going to go play "Hooky"!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we promised.
Patrick: Well, I had my fingers crossed.
SpongeBob: You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us!
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
SpongeBob: Umm...
Patrick: See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun. [Patrick goes up and down the hooks] Come on, SpongeBob! You know you want to!
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another... [almost runs into a hook. Gasps] ...hook! [almost touches the hook but takes it back] Oh no. Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar. A deceiver. I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never! [goes back to hook] Is this seat taken? [hook takes him up, but when he comes down and turns around, it is shown that he is hooked at the pants] Whew! Glad I got that out of my system. [gasps] I'm hooked. And that means... [shows the tuna can with SpongeBob crammed inside] AAAAAHHH!!! HELP!! I'M HOOKED! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Pearl: Thanks, dad.
Mr. Krabs: Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
Mr. Krabs: Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
SpongeBob: Umm...no. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! Yes, you told me not to go near them!
Mr. Krabs: Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Of course not. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean, not exactly. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! YES I DID IT! I admit it! [cries] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me. [shows the hook to Mr. Krabs] I'm hooked!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy. [group of girls laugh. SpongeBob looks at his pants]
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls! [hook pulls him closer] D’oh, okay! I'm taking 'em off. I'm taking 'em off. [takes pants off] There.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... lad?
SpongeBob: [screams, after noticing the hook caught in his underwear] Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs! I can't do it. Anything but that!
Mr. Krabs: I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob. [he places a "Help Wanted" sign on the door] But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [hook pulls him a little closer] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise! [He holds on to a flower but the hook pulls him away. He holds on to the Krusty Krab signpost] Please save me, Mr. Krabs! [cries] I promise I'll be good! [underwear tears off] Whew! [the signpost flings him into the door naked, which makes the girls laugh]
Pearl: Oooh, look! It's SpongeBob NUDIE Pants! [SpongeBob screams and runs]
Squidward: [holding a fishing rod with SpongeBob's underwear on the hook] Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Squidward: Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. [both laugh. Shows SpongeBob running back to his house]
SpongeBob: The pants! The underwear! [cries]
Patrick: [bus drops off a can of tuna] Hellllo? Does somebody have a can opener?


Narrator: Ah, beautiful springtime. A time for fun and frolic for most... [The scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, zooming in and then right at the front door. Squidward is there] but not for this poor slob. [Referring to Squidward]
Squidward: Oh, what a beautiful day. And here I am trapped in a prison of high cholesterol. [bell dings] No one ever comes in on Sunday. [bell dings again] Why can't Mr. Krabs just let us go home? [bell dings again. Squidward gets angry. The scene changes to to SpongeBob ringing a bell, set on the order window. Squidward runs up to SpongeBob] SpongeBob, stop ringing this bell! [He picks it up and slams it on the bottom of the order window]
SpongeBob: I was just testing it. [Squidward leans through the order window getting in SpongeBob's face]
Squidward: I will ring the bell when there's an order. But... [scene zooms out to show that the restaurant is empty] There's no customers! There hasn't been one all day and there isn't gonna be any! [he struggles to pick up the cash register, but successfully does so and he slams it down making a bell noise]
SpongeBob: One Krabby Patty coming up!
Squidward: No!
[The register drawer shoots open, knocking Squidward out of the way. A bunch of coins fall onto the floor. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs’ office where Mr. Krabs is writing something on a sheet of paper and he stops to hear the money dropping.]
Mr. Krabs: That sounds like me money dropping. [The scene changes to show the outside of the office and Squidward is picking up the coins. Mr. Krabs opens his office door.] What's going on out here?! My babies! [runs up to Squidward and shoves him away] Get away, you barbarian! What have you done? Nice, clean money... soiled! [scoops up the coins in his claws] I'll take care of ya. Let papa clean ya up. [The scene changes to show a long shot of SpongeBob staring out from the order window] Clear the way! [he runs into the kitchen and starts washing them off in the sink] No, no, no, don't cry, little ones.
SpongeBob: What's wrong, Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs gets startled and throws the dimes in the air. One dime rolls into the sink and starts to roll towards the sink drain]
Mr. Krabs: Me dime!  [The dime rolls around sink drain. Just as it seems like it's about to fall down the drain, it flips over facing away from the drain. Mr. Krabs gives a sigh of relief. Then the dime jumps, winks, and goes down the drain] No! [grabs the dime in the drain] I got it, boy! [tries to take his claw out] What the? It's stuck! You gotta help me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You've gotta let go of the dime.
Mr. Krabs: I can think of ten good reasons to never let go of a dime, boy. There's got to be another way! Grab me captain's quarters and heave! [SpongeBob pulls on Mr. Krabs from behind a couple times until Mr. Krabs gets thrown back without his arms] Me arms!
SpongeBob: Oh no, not again! [Mr. Krabs hits the wall, the impact causing the shelf above him to slant and drop a pot, a glass, a pan, a mug, a treasure chest, an anchor, a buoy, and a scuba suit on his head. A giant bump rises up on Mr. Krabs' head. and then a dime falls on it, causing Krabs to fall over and black out. Scene changes to show an ambulance outside the Krusty Krab and two paramedics start to carry out Mr. Krabs on a stretcher.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait. [The paramedics stop moving] Squidward... I'm putting you in charge of things around here while I'm gone.
Squidward: [smiles] You can count on me, sir! [The paramedics continue to carry Mr. Krabs out. A third paramedic carries out Mr. Krabs' arms] Take care, Hurry back. Get well soon. You're in our thoughts. [The final paramedic enters the ambulance and it drives off.] Takes more muscles to frown than to smile. [shuts the door] Okay, SpongeBob, let's get down to business. My first official act as new manager is to give you a promotion.
[SpongeBob's pupils form into stars.]
SpongeBob: Ahh! Really?
Squidward: You get to run the cash register.
SpongeBob: The cash register... Wow! Squidward, who's gonna work the grill?
Squidward: You are-- It's part of the promotion I mentioned earlier. You'll be wearing two hats now. You're gonna take the orders and then you're gonna make them! [puts his hat next to SpongeBob's hat]
SpongeBob: Ah... This is the best day of my life.
Squidward: Me, too.
SpongeBob: But wait, if I'm running the register and the grill, what are you gonna do?
Squidward: I've got some very important boss-like errands to run. See ya later. [he runs off]
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: [He is half-way out the door] What is it?
SpongeBob: You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register. [He rubs the cash register]
Squidward: You push the button and put the money inside. Okay, you're on your own. [walks off as SpongeBob hugs the cash register]
SpongeBob: I can't believe this is really happening. [sits on the cash register box. He starts to tear up.] Today, I start living! 
[The scene changes to show Squidward walking outside]
Squidward: Well, Squidward, you've really outdone yourself this time. A beautiful day of relaxing and pampering... With pay. Hmm... I guess I do kinda feel bad for poor little SpongeBob, all by his lonesome... Oh, oh, it'll pass. He's probably just standing at the register with that stupid grin on his face. [scene cuts to Squidward's imagination: SpongeBob and Patrick in the Krusty Krab with dopey looks on their faces]
Thought Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
Thought SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick!
Thought Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, could you give me change for a quarter? [holds up quarter]
Thought SpongeBob: No problem! [takes the quarter, bangs on the register until it opens, and gives Patrick a giant pile of money] Here ya go!
Thought Patrick: Thanks.
[the scene goes back to reality]
Squidward: [gasps] I forgot to tell him how to make change! Oh! [he runs back to the restaurant, banging the doors open] Sponge... [sees only SpongeBob in the Krusty Krab] ...Bob. [checks the cash register to see if everything is still there. Gives a sigh of relief]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. All done with those errands?
Squidward: No, I am not. I just remembered I needed change for this dollar. [He pulls out a dollar from his pocket]
SpongeBob: Do you want four quarters? [holds up four quarters] Or ten dimes? [shows ten dimes on his left hand] Or twenty nickels? [shows ten nickels on each arm] Or one hundred pennies? [shows one-hundred pennies on his back] Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies? [shows the quarter on his nose, 3 dimes on his fingers, 7 nickels on his thumb, and ten pennies, in the shape of the cent symbol, on his foot] Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are...
Squidward: Alright, goodbye. [walks off. Scene changes to show Squidward's house where he comes out wearing sunglasses and blue shorts or bathing suit, he is carrying a lawn chair, a sunbathing mirror, an umbrella hat and a bottle of sunscreen.] This is great. My day off, no worries, just relaxation. [sets his lawn chair down, puts the hat on, puts the mirror down, and puts sunscreen on his nose.] I'm the boss, I deserve this. Ah...
Squidward: [voice over/Thoughts] Everything will be fine. There won't be any customers today anyway. He'll probably just stand there, bored. [imagines SpongeBob behind the counter just standing there. Squidward chuckles.] SpongeBob, bored. [he chuckles some more]
Thought SpongeBob: Ehh... Gettin' kinda bored. [yawns and falls asleep snoring. Krusty Krab spontaneously combusts and Squidward tries to blow it out but it's a thought bubble, so it goes away. Begins to run to the Krusty Krab, but stops.]
Squidward: Oh, what am I doing? [he pulls out a pocket watch] I am wasting valuable relaxing time, that's what I'm doing! I mean, really. What are the odds? SpongeBob setting the Krusty Krab on fire. [he walks back down the road, chuckling. Then, a fire truck drives down the road from to direction of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is startled and runs to the restaurant with a fire extinguisher. He opens the door and sprays the galley with foam. As the foam subsides, Squidward, now with a foam beard, walks over to SpongeBob, who has a foam mustache]
SpongeBob: May I help you, sir?
Squidward: [wipes off his foamy beard] It's me, you dunce!
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward! [mustache falls off] How are those errands going?
Squidward: What's that supposed to mean? I'm very busy.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm sure you are.
Squidward: I don't like your tone.
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] I'm sure you are. [normal voice again] How's that?
Squidward: Just do your jobs! [walks off]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles. [puts the spatula in his forehead. Squidward leaves, grumbling.] Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge. [The scene changes to show Squidward's house. The scene zooms into the interior. Squidward is trying to sit down.]
Squidward: Must... re... [cracks his back] ...lax! [He slouches in his chair. He pulls out a hand mirror] Look at yourself. You're losing your bluish glow! Stop worrying so much. Now, repeat after me: you will not go back to the Krusty Krab. [his reflection turns into SpongeBob]
Mirror SpongeBob: I will destroy the Krusty Krab! [Squidward screams and throws the mirror at the wall while it shatters and runs to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Have you finished...?
Squidward: No! [walks out] That's it. That's it. No matter what sick fantasies run through my mind, I will not go back to that restaurant! [walks into his house then runs out towards the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Have you finished those errands? [Squidward runs back to his house then back to the Krusty Krab] Have you finished those errands? [Squidward runs back to his house] Have you finished those errands? [Squidward runs to the Krusty Krab] Have you finished those errands? [Squidward keeps running back and forth while SpongeBob is repeating 'have you finished those errands?' Finally, Squidward enters the Krusty Krab and stops] Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands?
Squidward: No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be, so quit checking up on me! [walks up to SpongeBob] I know what you're up to. [He hits the cash register while he talks] Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!
SpongeBob: But I haven't...
Squidward: Okay, [He leans on the cash register] maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will. You will... [He slowly loses his sanity as he walks backwards] And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there! [He laughs hysterically and runs away]
SpongeBob: Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear [Rubs his hats] these hats. 
[The scene changes to show Squidward locking his door using his key, putting padlocks on it, bolting it down with wood and nails, putting police tape up, and using a blowtorch to weld the door shut so he can't get out]
Squidward: There! [He throws the blowtorch backwards] Now I'll have to stay here and enjoy myself! [His face looks weird because he has lost his sanity] I'm not even gonna think about you-know-who at the you-know-what doing I-don't-care. [laughs] Just gonna... Relax. [He walks to his shower, turns on the water, puts on his bathing cap and sits in his bathtub] Let Squid's day off...[Under the bath water] begin. [Squidward hears SpongeBob laughing] [above the bath water] What was that? [SpongeBob's laughing is heard again] It's SpongeBob. He's spying on me to see if I'm really doing errands. [gives a chuckle] But, but he left his post. [Gives another chuckle] And I've finally caught him messing up. [Gives another chuckle. He pokes his head out the window.] Aha! I caught you, Sponge... [notices that it's only the wind making a branch of coral brush against his house] ... Branch. [Squidward notices SpongeBob's silhouette with his two hats behind his shower curtain] Heh, here's that rubber duck Mr. Krabs wanted me to get. [pulls the curtain aside] I've got you now! Wait'll Mr. Krabs finds out you're a... [Sees his toilet with a shampoo bottle and 2 rolls of toilet paper on it] ... Toilet. You're losin' it, Squidward. Calm down. If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say...
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. [SpongeBob is in the bathtub with Squidward.] Are you finished with those errands yet? [goes under the water]
Squidward: Aha! [goes under the water and appears as a real octopus with a demonic voice] I know you're in here. [gasps] What? [SpongeBob is in the drain. He winks and goes down] He's heading back to the Krusty Krab! [Jumps out of his bathtub and runs to the door] I'll beat him there! [slams through the barricaded door with nothing on but his shower cap and bubbles foaming around his waist] I've got you now, SpongeBob! [runs past Sadie who covers her son's eyes with her hand]
Sadie: Hey, put some clothes on!
Squidward: [runs past Patrick lying on a rock] The truth will be revealed!
Patrick: [stands up] Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward! [The scene changes to show the hospital where Purple Doctorfish and Mr. Krabs are walking out]
Purple Doctorfish: Okay, Mr. Krabs. Get plenty of rest and if things don't seem right, come back. [walks inside]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, Doc. [He looks at the street and smiles until the nude and deranged Squidward runs past him]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you can't beat me! [Mr. Krabs frowns, his arms fall off again and he walks back into the hospital. Laughing hysterically, Squidward bursts into Krusty Krab to find SpongeBob already there as he never left] AHA! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha! Or the toilet in my bathroom! [SpongeBob looks confused and Squidward's saliva hits his face] And then you were in my bathtub, and [He slowly regains his sanity] I... and-and you... and I... and then you... swam... down the drain... and... beat me... to the Krusty... Krab.
SpongeBob: Uh, does that mean you're...? [Squidward covers SpongeBob's mouth with his hand]
Squidward: Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands. [hugs the register] I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do. 
[He rubs his face on the cash register. SpongeBob takes off his clothes (except his underwear) and hands them to Squidward]
SpongeBob: [Whispers] Then you might wanna put these on. [Squidward looks down and notices a bunch of bubbles. Close up of his legs and all the bubbles pop except for one, which pops after the close up, he grabs SpongeBob's pants and puts them on.] Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look! [walks back with the "open"/"closed" sign] We forgot to switch the "Closed" sign to "Open". [flips the sign from "Closed" to "Open"]. It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off! [He laughs. Squidward's nose falls off and his head deflates. His whole body soon falls gently to the ground.]


[The exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple is shown. The scene zooms into the interior of the pineapple, SpongeBob's bed room. His alarm clock goes off. SpongeBob gets up, still in his underwear, puts his blanket on like a cape, and uses the wind of the alarm clock to "fly" at his big calendar. He lands on the 20th day, which is a Sunday.] 
SpongeBob: Wow, it's Sunday, Gary! Guess what's for breakfast?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [The scene changes to show the two his kitchen. SpongeBob opens the door.] That's right! [puts a bowl on the kitchen counter] A sundae! [runs to the freezer and finds it empty] Whoops... Looks like we're out of ice cream. Guess I'll have to use something else... Ketchup! [Runs back to the bowl with a big bottle of Ketchup. He squeezes a bunch of ketchup into the bowl. He runs over to a cupboard] Hmmm... Bananas... Cherries... Boring. [closes cupboard door] Ah, here we go! Onions! [runs up to the counter with two sacks that say "onions" on them.] Ready, Gary?
Gary: Meow. [Plays a violin while SpongeBob cries while peeling the onions into the bowl]
SpongeBob: Just one more thing! Pea... [opens up another cupboard, but finds an empty jar] ...nuts. Gary! [He walks over to Gary while shaking the empty jar] Our peanuts jar is totally empty! [Gary burps] Hmmm... [snaps fingers] Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts. [looks in the bathroom and finds a peanut plant in front of the window] Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill. [throws the plant into the sundae bowl] A little texture never hurt. There we go. [gets out a spoon] This sundae's gonna taste great! [He turns around] Aren't you going to help me, Gary? Gary? Oh, well. More for me! [takes a few spoonfuls. Scene cuts to SpongeBob coming out of the kitchen with a bunch of stink coming out with him. He drops his spoon while Gary hides behind a coral plant.] You know what they say, Gary. I'm easy like Sunday morning. ["morning" comes out of SpongeBob's mouth and wraps itself around Gary's eyes, twisting them. The scene changes to show SpongeBob outside his house.] Okay, let's see my to-do list. [takes out a big long list] Go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work.. [his list "droops"] Wait, that's not right. I need the one for Sunday. [takes out a small piece of paper] Ah, here we go. 'Say hi to everyone in Bikini Bottom'. [runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob running up to a citizen] Hello. [citizen runs off in disgust of his bad breath. SpongeBob waves] Some people are even late on Sunday. [SpongeBob notices a mailman] Hi, Mailfish. [mailman smells SpongeBob's bad breath and he breaks his skin into a smaller fish and then into another smaller fish. SpongeBob hears a whistling noise] Hi, Mrs. Crossing Guard! [crossing guard gets a whiff of his bad breath]
Mrs. Crossing Guard: Mother of mercy! [children walk across the street and then the sound of a crashing car sounds, but it’s revealed to actually be a parade]
SpongeBob: Wow! A parade! Hi, parade! [the band stops]  Hi, tuba player, hi, drummer, hi, guy with the cymbals, hi, trumpeter, hi tambourine girl, hi, timbale man, hi, didgeridoo player, [didgeridoo player wears a big skirt, hat, sunglasses] hi, triangle player, hi, guy with the kettle drum, hi, pianist, hi, guy with the flute. And heeelllooo, Dolly! [the stench ball rolls down the street, knocking the band out like a bunch of bowling pins and scattering them about. They all run out wailing in pain and disgust. The whole town is soon deserted]
Fish bands: My leg! My leg! [they all run away from the stench]
SpongeBob: Was it something I said? [he walks down the street] Something weird is going on today. Everyone is running away from me. And now... [he notices a giant pink wad on a bench] ...giant piles of bubble gum?! Oh, what next? [Patrick's head pops out from it]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob. [his appendages form from the wad]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Patrick. I'm confused.
Patrick: Yes, I am.
SpongeBob: Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch. [he walks over to a building] Hi, building! [the stench bounces off the building, and it slowly moves away. SpongeBob walks back to Patrick] I just don't get it.
[The stench goes toward Patrick, but bounces off him, as he has no nose.]
Patrick: I don't either. Maybe it's the way you're dressed. [pan up slowly at SpongeBob's clothes, looking fancy]
Both: Nah.
Patrick: Maybe it's your voice. [SpongeBob laughs  for an extended time, then stops]
SpongeBob: Good one, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, maybe it's just because you're ugly.
SpongeBob: Ugly? [he puts a finger in his mouth, wipes his forehead with it, then strikes a pose. A spotlight goes off] You gotta be kiddin' me..
Patrick: Better try the reflection test. [he pulls out a large mirror]
SpongeBob: [to his reflection] Hi. [the stench hits his reflection, and the reflection takes a hammer and breaks the mirror. Pat peeks through it]
Patrick: Ugly.
SpongeBob: Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly! [he runs up to a couple] Am I ugly? [the two catch a whiff on the stench. The husband pulls down a hook, the two bites down on it and the hook is reeled in. SpongeBob runs off and latches onto a car's windshield] Am I ugly? [the stench goes around the glass and hits the driver's eyes]
Driver: My eyes! My eyes!
[the car swerves, spins around, throwing SpongeBob off, then explodes. All that's left is the charred frame, but a policeman gives it a ticket anyway. A tire bounces by and lands on SpongeBob, who is on the ground]
SpongeBob: Oof I'm ugly... [cut to night at SpongeBob's house. Lightning strikes repeatedly as Patrick walks in]
Patrick: SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads? [he walks through the dark house. He opens the library door. It's pitch dark, except for a light from the fire. SpongeBob mournfully plays Phantom of the Opera-style organ music. Patrick walks up to him, and he stops playing.] SpongeBob? [the lights go on, and SpongeBob turns. He's wearing a Groucho Marx-esque nose and glasses, and a dark cape. He turns his back to Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am. [he hits down on the organ]
Patrick: Sure they would! It makes them feel better about the way they look! Maybe a story will cheer you up. [he picks SpongeBob up, without glasses or cape, up and puts him in his comfy chair] It's called, 'The Ugly Barnacle.' [SpongeBob listens attentively] Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end. [Patrick grins, oblivious to his story's bad message]
SpongeBob: That didn't help at all. [he starts sobbing] How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?
Patrick: As long as I can remember. You poor ugly thing, you. [SpongeBob clings on Patrick]
SpongeBob: Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling! [Patrick smacks SpongeBob in the face, twisting his head around] Thanks, Patrick. [Patrick holds his hand up again, and SpongeBob stops him, stammering] It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over.
Patrick: Just do what I do when I have problems. [screaming] Scream! [SpongeBob is covered with spit from Patrick. Patrick grabs SpongeBob and runs off] Come on, buddy. I'll help you. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick on the roof] Okay, now, say it. [SpongeBob hesitates] Say it.
SpongeBob: I can't.
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest. [we see SpongeBob has a alien-like leach sucking on his chest]
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick. [he pulls it off and throws it aside]
Patrick: Say it. Say it.
SpongeBob: I'm ugly.
Patrick: You're ugly and what...?
SpongeBob: Square?
Patrick: No. Proud.
SpongeBob: I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Patrick: Good! Say it louder.
SpongeBob: [louder] I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Patrick: Louder.
SpongeBob: [louder] I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Patrick: Louder!
SpongeBob: [yelling] I'm ugly and I'm proud! [pan over to Squidward's roof, where he's tanning] I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud!
Squidward: Is that what he calls it? [SpongeBob is breathing heavily]
SpongeBob: That felt great! I feel empowered.
Patrick: So whaddya wanna do now?
SpongeBob: I don't know. How about a movie? [cut to 'The Reef' movie theater. SpongeBob and Patrick walk into a crowded theater. The two go down the front row] Pardon me. Ugly sponge coming through. [two fish smell SpongeBob's breath, their pupils turn to crosses, and they float upward]
Patrick: People respect self esteem. [he and SpongeBob sit down in the two now empty seats. SpongeBob leans over to a woman sitting next to him]
SpongeBob: Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway. [the stench burns the woman's eyes, complexion, and hair off, and her head is now all charred. SpongeBob leans over Patrick to the man beside Patrick, who is a blue version of Fred.] Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you.
Fred: Not at all, boy. [sniffs] Deuueaugh! [Smells SpongeBob's bad breath. Makes a sourly disgusted expression, screams out a disgusted noise, and then quickly runs away]
Patrick: [to SpongeBob] Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a- [he notices his friend crying] SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?
SpongeBob: [sobbing] I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried, [he turns around, revealing an extremely deflated face] but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide. [Patrick goes from sad to angry]
Patrick: [loudly] What is wrong with you people?! [he stands up, dropping his drinks in the process] Afraid to look ugliness in the face? [he picks up SpongeBob] Well, here! Look at it! [the stench pours into the audience] It's ugly, isn't it?! [he points SpongeBob at five people] You look at it!
SpongeBob: Hello.
[The fish run off. Patrick points SpongeBob at a larger group of people]
Patrick: You look at it!
SpongeBob: Hi.
[The fish run off.]
Patrick: [points SpongeBob at the whole audience] Look at it! [the entire room empties out] Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!

[Everybody screams in terror and they all run out of the theater in a panic. Patrick and SpongeBob are all alone in the theater]
SpongeBob: They all ran away, Patrick.
Patrick: I bet there's no line at the snack bar. [cut to the snack bar. Patrick leans over the counter] Hello...? Hello...? They must be on break.
[Patrick looks bummed out]
SpongeBob: Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered. [he reaches in his pocket and pulls out some of his sundae] I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!
[The fume of it floats past Patrick, burning off his eyebrows]
Patrick: That looks great! [closes his mouth on SpongeBob's hand, and sucks out the sundae. Patrick sighs with relief, but he starts to feel funny, His stomach makes engine spluttering noises] Oh, I gotta go to the restroom! [he runs off. Cut to the bathroom, where Patrick and Wobbles wash their hands at the sink] I'm out of soap, can I borrow- [the stench reaches the guy]
Wobbles: Stay back!
Patrick: I just want some-
[Wobbles takes out some money]
Wobbles: Here! Here's my money! [he drops it] Take it! Take it and go away!
[Wobbles runs off]
Patrick: My hands aren't that dirty... [he walks over to a line of three fish waiting at a stall] Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?
[Patrick's breath reaches the fish and they make disgusted noises.]
Clay: You tryin' to kill us?!
[The fish walkout murmuring. Patrick looks in the mirror.]
Patrick: [In shock] Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!
[SpongeBob walks in]
SpongeBob: Patrick, is everything okay in here? [he hears Patrick sobbing. He opens a stall door and sees Patrick sitting on the toilet with a bag over his head] What are you doing in there, Patrick?
Patrick: Wouldn't you like to know?
SpongeBob: And why is that bag on your head?
Patrick: Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly! [he whips the bag off. SpongeBob recoils and gasps. Patrick walks out] What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!
SpongeBob: Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.
Patrick: That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me! [his breath reaches SpongeBob and he holds his nose in disgust] I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.
SpongeBob: Patrick...?
Patrick: What's my mom gonna say?
SpongeBob: [plugging his nose] Patrick?
Patrick: Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes or even bad hair, but... [SpongeBob screams at Patrick in rage to get his attention and stop his rambling as it works]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Calmly] You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad. [Patrick sighs with relief, his stench in the shape of a skull and crossbones]
Patrick: [Relaxed]Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief...
SpongeBob: [his eyes water from the foul smell] Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?!
Patrick: Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
SpongeBob: No, I mean just this morning.
Patrick: Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
SpongeBob: What else?
Patrick: Well, I had some of your sundae.
SpongeBob: Sundae... [he whips what's remaining of it out] Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!
Patrick: Whatcha mean? [SpongeBob coughs as Patrick's breath flies by him]
SpongeBob: I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!
Patrick: Stink? [the two cheer and run around in circles chanting]
Both: We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink!
[The fumes encompass the entire theater and it dissolves to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick run out and run up to Squidward, who is looking through the window of a wig shop.]
SpongeBob: Oh, guess what, Squidward?
Both: We stink! [the two hug Squidward, and then run off, still cheering] Oh yeah! We're smelly! I reek! Smell me! [the two run off until they're out of sight]


[At the Krusty Krab, Squidward is at the ordering boat and SpongeBob is looking out from the ordering window. Mr. Krabs' voice sounds on the P.A.]
Mr. Krabs: Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention! [Mr. Krabs is standing next to them, speaking into a megaphone] Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office! [pause] That will be all. [Squidward and SpongeBob follow Mr. Krabs into his office and sit down] I have an important announcement to make.
SpongeBob: Woo! Hooray! [SpongeBob jumps up on top of the chair and twirls it around] The new spatulas are here!
Mr. Krabs:  Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulers!
Squidward: [sarcastically] How disappointing.
Mr. Krabs: You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast. [he looks at a picture of Pearl and Mr. Krabs in swim attire jumping up from the water] It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh... [puts the picture back on the wall] Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers! [a bell rings]
Pearl: [off-screen] Hello? Daddy?
Mr. Krabs: Thar she blows! [Mr. Krabs leaves the room]
Squidward: SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?
SpongeBob: No new spatulas?
Squidward: No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?
SpongeBob: Right! [SpongeBob and Squidward shake hands]
Squidward: So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions.
SpongeBob: Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs' head pokes into the office] All right, men. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk out of the office] Say hello to me Pearl.
SpongeBob: Hello, pole. [SpongeBob hugs one of the giant pillars]
Pearl: [holding a box] Hi, guys.
Mr. Krabs: It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!
Pearl: Great, dad, because I have so many new ideas.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs sniffs the air and his eyes conjoin to make a dollar sign shape] I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me! [walks off]
SpongeBob: What's in the box?
Pearl: It's a surprise.
SpongeBob: I like surprises.
Pearl: Great, then close your eyes.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob covers his eyes with his hands] I'm ready! [Pearl puts the box's open end over SpongeBob]
Squidward: Well, I like it so far.
Pearl: [Pearl lifts up the box] Ta-da... [Squidward gasps. The body suit is pink with purple flowers and on the top are two K's being held up by springs.] It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself. [Pearl hands SpongeBob a mirror]
Squidward: Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform.
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. [he winks to him] Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!
Squidward: Fish paste.
Pearl: Oh, SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu! [giggles]
Squidward: Well, I didn't think it was possible, SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual.
Pearl: Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you, too. [she holds up his uniform]
Squidward: Don't bother! Only a fool would wear that!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office, wearing the uniform] Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers? [laughs, then shuts the door. Krabs peeks his head out] Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for.
Squidward: [with the uniform on. The two springs give and the K's fall over Squidward's eyes] Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.
Pearl: Squidward is such a barnacle.
SpongeBob: A stick in the sand.
Pearl: But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style.
SpongeBob: Me? Really?
Pearl: Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me.
SpongeBob: Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here. [he looks at a picture he drew of Mr. Krabs, himself and Squidward with mustaches]
Pearl: Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess, [cut to a view of the Krusty Krab as a deserted place, where a skeleton is sitting at a table] we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise.
Pearl: [cut to Pearl with a notepad, thinking] SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?
Squidward: [Squidward runs over] For what, dare I ask?
Pearl: The new name for our new look. I mean, "The Krusty Krab" has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh! [she points the pencil towards her open mouth, to show disgust]
Squidward: Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?
Pearl: Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab? [puckers up lips and makes kissing noises]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is now in royal attire] The King Krab?
Pearl: [Pearl holds up a lollipop, which bears an odd resemblance to her father] The Kandy Krab!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob dressed as a jazzy beatnik] The Kool Krab. [dresses as a cowboy riding a stick horse] Or the Kowboy Krab! [appears totally stretched out] The Kurly Krab. [appears as a mad scientist holding a brain with Mr. Krabs-like arms coming from it] The Kreepy Krab. [Appears as a crazy killer jungle man with a loincloth. Shouts scarily.] The Killer Krab!
Pearl: [freaked out] Aaah! No!
SpongeBob: You're right, too scary. [they both think and finally get the name]
SpongeBob and Pearl: The Kuddly Krab! [Both happily hug and laugh. A rainbow of colors fills the screen. Pearl, SpongeBob and an anguished Squidward stand outside the new restaurant. The sign for the restaurant is now a heart and a cutesy robot Krabs is waving his arms atop it. The restaurant outside itself is tie-dyed with colors and rainbows and the flags are now hearts. Balloons are hanging from the roof and giant lollipops come from the chimney. Pearl and SpongeBob, giggling, walk back in the restaurant. Squidward is so mad that the two K's on his uniform catch on fire and he shakes the pole. Millie and Fred drive by in a car.]
Millie: It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab.
Fred: That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?
Squidward: That's it! I quit! [he rips off his uniform, revealing nothing under it. A police whistle is blown and a cop comes over. He writes him a ticket and places it between his legs. Inside the restaurant, it's a total makeover, like Pearl said before, it's a teenage paradise.]
Shelia: Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out! [Pearl and SpongeBob admire their restaurant]
SpongeBob: Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl.
Pearl: Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision. [blinks bashfully]
SpongeBob: Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill. [SpongeBob is in the kitchen at the grill] The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter. [he pushes his spatula on the grill and imitates a sizzle]
Pearl: [Pearl is in the ordering window to hand SpongeBob an order] SpongeBob, order up!
SpongeBob: Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a [pronounces it wrong] sa-lad? [cut to SpongeBob walking up to Pearl with a tray with two Krabby Patties] Here you go. Two sa-lads.
Pearl: Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.
SpongeBob: But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.
Pearl: Exactly.
SpongeBob: All right. [walks back to the kitchen and sadly removes the top bun] Okay, no buns. That's hip. [removes the bottom buns and top buns] No patties, [removes the patties] happenin.' [crushed] Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.
Nazz: This is so cool!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob walks over with a tray of salads to Nazz and Nancy at a table, who are talking] Two salads. [he drops the tray on the table and walks back to the kitchen] That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it. [he screams, noticing the grill is gone] Where's the grill?
Pearl: Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!
SpongeBob: Uh... right on.
Pearl: Check out this new menu I came up with. [SpongeBob takes the menu]
SpongeBob: [reading it] Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?
Pearl: Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore. [takes the spatula from SpongeBob. He starts to stutter] I've got something more fun for you to do anyway. [cut to SpongeBob outside the restaurant in a crab suit, waving at cars. One car with Gus stops]
Gus: Hey, buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention! [laughs and drives off]
SpongeBob: This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much! [he walks toward the restaurant, but gravity gets the best of him and he falls over. He struggles to get up and starts to whimper. Cut to SpongeBob at Mr. Krabs' door, outside the costume.] Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on... [he knocks on the door and peeks in] Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you? [Mr. Krabs' office is just as elaborately decorated as the rest of the restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: Come on in, me boy! Have a seat.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [he sits down in a bear bean bag chair, but starts to sink inside it]
Mr. Krabs: Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob has sunk in, now you can only see his eye] Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem.
Mr. Krabs: Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob has totally sunk into the chair and he sticks out his hand] Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news.
Mr. Krabs: How about my cuddly executive buddy? [picks up a blue stress-relief doll] Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95. [Krabs squeezes it and its eyes, nose and ears pop out]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob pops out of the chair] Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab! [he covers his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab. [goes over to a picture of a seahorse] What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers? [goes to a strand of lights] How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?! [holds one up] It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money! [starts to cry] Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?
SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way.
Mr. Krabs: That's it, boy!
SpongeBob: What's it?
Mr. Krabs: You could fire her! It's okay if she hates you.
SpongeBob: That's not what I said, sir. [Mr. Krabs brings SpongeBob to the door]
Mr. Krabs: Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office. [SpongeBob is pushed out the door and accidentally runs into Pearl]
Pearl: Totally rude, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?
Pearl: Sure, SpongeBob. [they walk to the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [thinking] How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes. [SpongeBob opens his mouth to say it, but Pearl is already crying]
Pearl: [crying] Oh, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob lets out a sigh of some relief]
Pearl: I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!
SpongeBob: Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!
Pearl: No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob thinks for a second] I got it! I can pretend to [air quotes] "fire you." I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.
Pearl: [Pearl grabs SpongeBob in a bone-snapping hug] Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!
SpongeBob: [muffled] Stop trying to break me in half?
Pearl: [Pearl drops him] Deal. [cut to SpongeBob and Pearl walking up to Mr. Krabs' door, Pearl tries to conceal her laughing] Oh, boy!
SpongeBob: Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing. [loud and clear] Pearl, I need to have a word with you! [we see Mr. Krabs in his office, sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen.
SpongeBob: It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that...
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs is pushed against the door] Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way? [he sees himself in the uniform in the mirror] It's for the best.
SpongeBob: Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if...
Mr. Krabs: I can't let him do this! [he goes for the door, then sees the vault open. It's empty, and a spider crawls around its web] Get on with it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Pearl, you're fired. [Mr. Krabs chokes and falls over]
Pearl: Thanks, SpongeBob. [kisses him. She runs off and jumps into a car with all her friends] Come on, gang, the mall awaits! [they drive off. SpongeBob runs into the office]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it! [he screams when he sees Mr. Krabs' body. He runs over to a bill behind glass, which is for emergency purposes and he breaks the glass. He waves the bill under Mr. Krabs' nose.]
Mr. Krabs: [regaining consciousness] Oh, Pearly... [sniffs] Is that a $20? [he pockets the bill] Oh, SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood? [cries]
SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy.
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: She's off to bigger and better things.
Mr. Krabs: That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man! [laughs] But how am I gonna get my money back for all this stuff? [SpongeBob thinks. Cut to his house, where all the stuff is put up in his house. SpongeBob dances in his uniform to the music]
SpongeBob: [laughing] Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!
Gary: [Gary is covered in stuffed animals and his shell has flowers painted on it] Meow?


Narrator: Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life. [chuckles] Well, you know. [Patrick is sleeping and the mailfish walks by and puts a box in his open mouth as he is yawning and waking up, he grabs it and quickly opens it, and it turns out to be a shiny, gold trophy]
Patrick: An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award. [antenna on top of rock breaks] Jellyfish, I got an award. [jellyfish zap him and he jumps up above the surface] Island, I got an awar... [chokes for air and floats back down] I gotta show SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [building a house of cards looking like Gary] Hold still, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Almost done. [Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor; Gary flies away]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.[SpongeBob falls down to the floor]
SpongeBob: That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
Patrick: See for yourself.
SpongeBob: [his body is facedown, but his face come out and reads the award] "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?"
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
Patrick: But, it's shiny. [SpongeBob takes the trophy]
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
Patrick: Ice cream!
SpongeBob: Exactly!
Patrick: I can find it. Is it in here?
SpongeBob: No, don't! That's my... [Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet] ...award closet.
Patrick: I want an award! [starts to cry]
SpongeBob: [has two 1st place ribbons in his eyes] Aww, Patrick, don't cry. [Patrick starts sobbing loudly and wildly going away from the awards] You'll get an award one day.
Patrick: I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.
SpongeBob: But you're Patrick... [jumps on Patrick and his eyes turn into stars] Star. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.
Patrick: Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
SpongeBob: Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
Patrick: I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
SpongeBob: Smaller. [shrinks]
Patrick: Doctor?
SpongeBob: Smaller. [shrinks more]
Patrick: Fireman?
SpongeBob: [In a tiny voice] The smallest you can think of. [shrinks even more]
Patrick: A job at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Yeah! [grows to normal size] I do things at work all the time.
Patrick: Then let's go. [Patrick runs off, pulling off SpongeBob's arm]
Patrick: Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.
SpongeBob: And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?
Squidward: Guess who just quit? [puts his hat on Patrick's head and then leaves]
Patrick: Do I get my award yet?
SpongeBob: You have to work for it, remember?
Patrick: Tartar sauce. [SpongeBob flipping patties]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob places the order in the window] Pick up order! [Patrick comes and eats the order]
Patrick: Do I get my award, now?
SpongeBob: No, you have to take the tray to the customer.
Patrick: Ok. [tray gets to table but with no food; Patrick burps]
SpongeBob: Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table. [Patrick arrives with food on tray but then eats it as he sits down]
Patrick: Like that?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Patrick: [spits out food at the customer as he talks] Barnacles!
SpongeBob: Let's try something different.
SpongeBob: All you have to do is answer the phone.
Patrick: Aye aye, Captain! [phone rings]
Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: No, this is Patrick. [hangs up and starts whistling; phone rings again]
Girl on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: [annoyed] No, this is Patrick! [hangs up and continues to whistle; phone rings yet again]
Another Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: [angry] No! This is Patrick! [puts phone down and folds his arms] I'm not a Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
Patrick: Huh? Oh...Fishpaste!
SpongeBob: It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out? [hands Patrick a broom]
Patrick: What's the point? I can't do anything right.
SpongeBob: You'll do fine. [Patrick sweeps with the handle side of the broom instead of the head]
Nat: [approaches Patrick] Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown? [continues drinking]
SpongeBob: Keep trying, Patrick.
Delivery Guy: I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants. [Patrick becomes furious and sweeps harder]
Patrick: Why can't I do anything right?! [bangs the head of the broom on the floor making dust rise all over the Krusty Krab's dining area, which makes the nearby customers start coughing]
SpongeBob: [pushing Patrick] Kitchen!
Patrick: [throws the broom to the floor] I'm never gonna get an award, now.
SpongeBob: Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar. [gets a jar and opens the lid] Easy. Now you try. First get a jar. [Patrick gets out a pickle] Patrick, that's a pickle.
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: You need a jar. [Patrick picks up a spatula] No. [Patrick takes his pants off] No. [Patrick picks up SpongeBob] No. Try...this! [gives Patrick a jar] Now take the lid off the jar. [puts the lid in his mouth] Just relax. Lift your hand. [Patrick lifts his hand] Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. [puts his hand on counter] No, the lid. [slides his hand to the corner of the counter] [Patrick tries for the lid over and over as SpongeBob keeps telling him "the lid", Patrick pants due to exhaustion; few seconds later, Patrick is almost there] Freeze! [hand is on the side of the jar] Almost there. Now head for the lid. [hand goes lower] Cold. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!
SpongeBob: Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, you did it!
SpongeBob: That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.
Patrick: Yeah. Remember when I had my hand up? And I put it on the lid?
SpongeBob: That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [Patrick copies SpongeBob then SpongeBob stops] Huh?
SpongeBob: Well, back to the ol' grind.
Patrick: Well, back to the ol' grind.
SpongeBob: Forget my hat.
Patrick: Uh, me, too.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob mops the floor then puts the mop up; Patrick mops the floor but he makes the floor wet; SpongeBob comes out with a handful of plates and slips and breaks them all; Patrick follows in SpongeBob's footsteps; SpongeBob glares at him]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [at the grill, frying patties, both whistle a tune, then stop, they both wipe their foreheads] Whew! [SpongeBob drops his spatula]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Dropped my spatula. [bends down to pick it up]
Patrick: Uhh, me, too. [drops spatula and bends down to pick it up; SpongeBob takes off his hat, then Patrick takes off his, they both put their hats back on, then they both put their hands on the grill; Patrick's hand burns after a few seconds] Ow!
SpongeBob: Aha! [shows the fake hand] You're copying me!
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Why are you doing that?
Patrick: So I can win an award like you.
SpongeBob: Well, it's annoying, so stop it!
Patrick: Stop it. [both imitate the others facial expressions]
SpongeBob: Say, you're good.
Patrick: Thanks.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ha! Darn. [both look at each other with suspicion, while rubbing their chins] Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as...pickle fish lips! [both cover their mouths] Sea weavle. Gorgy smorgy.
SpongeBob: [in his head] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
Patrick: [in his head] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [screaming]
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick run out of the Krusty Krab] Stop copying me!
Patrick: There's no award for that!
Squidward: [leaning against the Krusty Krab sign pole, reading a newspaper, a Krusty Krab hat falls near him] Well, I guess it's safe to go in now. [puts hat back on and walks back in]
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick are still running] Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?
Patrick: Until I have as many awards as you.
SpongeBob: We'll see about that!
Patrick: No, we won't.
SpongeBob: [takes out a jump-rope] I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: Me, too. [takes out a jump-rope]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice. [crosses arms and jump-ropes while Patrick tries to imitate but ties himself up with his rope] Ha! Not a scratch on me. [body breaks down into pieces]
Patrick: Oh, no, you don't! [squeezes the rope on himself breaking his body down into smaller pieces, then both hit a hammer on their heads]
SpongeBob: Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?
Patrick: Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you. [SpongeBob stops hammering his head but Patrick does not notice; Patrick hits himself faster and too hard, he stops and gets dizzy, trophies appear and spin around his head, and falls on the ground; SpongeBob runs into Patrick's rock painted as SpongeBob's house; SpongeBob gets angry and steam comes out of his head]
Patrick: My turn! [runs into the pineapple rock]
SpongeBob: [runs into his house] I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me. [pushes his nose into his face and comes out of his house dressed in Patrick's normal outfit] Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.
Patrick: What's so great about being a big pink loser? [SpongeBob's nose pops back out] Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick...
Patrick: Patrick's not here!
Delivery Guy: [stops in front of SpongeBob and Patrick in truck] Trophy delivery! [he drives off and SpongeBob has a package in his mouth]
SpongeBob: Another trophy?
Patrick: [sarcastically] Oh, great! [SpongeBob opens the package] What's it for THIS time?
SpongeBob: 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'. Patrick! This trophy's for you!
Patrick: Yay! [puts trophy on his head like a hat] Eee! [both rip off their present outfits to reveal their own normal outfits]
SpongeBob: So, what are you gonna do, now?
Patrick: I'm gonna go protect my title. [jumps on his rock and falls asleep, the rock closes]
Narrator: So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock.


Narrator: Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up.
SpongeBob: [jumps out of bed] Hey everybody! It's Leif Erikson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgen! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Erikson Day! There's a note.
Patrick: [as note] SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Erikson Day! Yingin-hinga-dinga! 
SpongeBob: Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me. [throws his costume away] Another note. 
Sandy: [as note] SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy. 
SpongeBob: I don't get it. The water's fine. [scene shows the treedome snowing inside] Hey, Squidward! Want to play? 
Squidward: [as note] No. 
SpongeBob: Are you sure? 
Squidward: [as note] Yes. 
SpongeBob: Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy! [lets go of the stick which falls to the ground] Nah... [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a pile of rocks] Rock Buddy! Nope... [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a sink] Sink Buddy! "[Sink Buddy drips a little water]" Almost... [scene cuts to SpongeBob again] I've got it! [dips his bubble wand into bubble soap and blows a human shape-like bubble] Bubble Buddy! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Bubble Buddy on the seesaw] This...is...great! [scene cuts to SpongeBob going up to the Krusty Krab with his bubble] I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob walks in the Krusty Krab but his bubble just floats at the door] Don't be shy, come on! [SpongeBob squeezes the bubble through the doors] 
Squidward: Please come again. When I'm not working. Next. 
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! 
Squidward: How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway? 
SpongeBob: I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy! 
Squidward: This bubble is your friend? [sees his reflection in Bubble Buddy's face; giggles] Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be? 
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not hungry. 
Squidward: Well, thanks for stopping by. 
SpongeBob: Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet! 
Squidward: Why would I do that? 
SpongeBob: He's hungry. 
Squidward: He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here! 
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the register] What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here. [a criminal is eating a Krabby Patty] At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds. 
Squidward: I'm not taking an order for a bubble. 
Mr. Krabs: Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe. [goes back to the cash register, then he peeks at Squidward] Even if you quit. [goes back into the cash register again] 
Squidward: May I take your order? 
SpongeBob: Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you. [reads the menu] Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything. [Mr. Krabs explodes through the cash register] 
Mr. Krabs: One of everything?! Whoopee! [rips off his shirt and applies a tattoo on himself that has a heart and the words "Bubble Buddy" through it] I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table. [points his eyes to a table in the opposite direction] 
SpongeBob: Bubble Buddy's thirsty. 
Squidward: How about a glass of our finest shampoo? [laughs] 
SpongeBob: Sounds great! [Squidward looks annoyed that he took his comment literally, walks off and returns with a shampoo bottle with a straw in it] 
Squidward: Here's your hair care product, sir. 
SpongeBob: Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws. [Squidward bends the straw] Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think? 
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [chews and spits a Krabby Patty for an old lady to eat] Think of the customer. 
Squidward: [drinks shampoo] Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy. 
SpongeBob: Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties! 
Squidward: And? 
SpongeBob: Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do? 
Squidward: We? How about you take these patties and sh... 
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen; cutting him off] Mr. Squidward! [Squidward frowns in annoyance; he takes back the patty and walks off with the cart] 
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch. 
Squidward: What, is he allergic to bread, too? 
SpongeBob: Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... 
Squidward: Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style! [sets a bigger ferris wheel on the table] And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask. 
SpongeBob: That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs waves] 
Mr. Krabs: So long, boys! You see, Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day. 
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab. [hands Mr. Krabs a $100 bill made of bubbles] 
Mr. Krabs: What's this? 
Squidward: Bubble money. [$100 bill pops. Squidward shows his hand full of bubble change] At least they left a tip! [all the bubbles pop as Mr. Krabs and Squidward start growling with fury. Scene cuts to Goo Lagoon] 
SpongeBob: Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here. [Scooter runs up to SpongeBob] 
Scooter: Dudes, bury me! [laughs] 
SpongeBob: See what I mean? [fade cut] All done! 
Scooter: [buried under the sand] All right! 
SpongeBob: Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy. 
Scooter: Don't just stand there, dude. The tide's coming in. [laughs. Water reaches him] Dude? 
SpongeBob: [places Bubble Buddy inside] My friend's in there. 
Harold: Congratulations. 
SpongeBob: [goes to the music and he dances along] Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah! [everyone looks at their rears and they leave in embarrassment] 
Pearl: It's the world-famous surf punk, Grubby Grouper! 
Grubby Grouper: Later, groupies! [shakes Pearl's hand] Grubby's got to go catch some gnarly pounders. Ahoo! 
Pearl: [looks at her fin which is dirty now] Oh, I'll never wash this flipper again. [SpongeBob walks up with Bubble Buddy] 
SpongeBob: Hey, Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy! [rubs Bubble Buddy's hands on Pearl's dirty flipper, her flipper is now clean. Pearl sobs. Scene cuts to the port-o-potty] It's his first time on his own. 
Harold: Once again, congratulations. [later, the line is longer. Picture scrolls over to where we see a sign that reads '45 minutes from this point'] 
Man: Popcorn! Peanuts! 
Lou: [sounding desperate] Ice cold drinks! 
Harold: [camera stops on Harold and SpongeBob as SpongeBob whistles and Peterson struggles to hold it in. Unable to take the wait anymore] Two hours is long enough! That's it! [opens the port-o-potty door to see Bubble Buddy] 
SpongeBob: Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished! [takes Bubble Buddy away, leaving everybody to glare at them] 
Francis: He kept us waiting for a bubble? 
Larry: That's nothing! He called us fat! [along with others, he begins crunching on celery stalk] 
Pearl: [crying as she shows her clean flipper] He washed my flipper! 
Mr. Krabs: [storming up] He owes me money! 
Squidward: [following Mr. Krabs] He made me provide excellent service! 
Scooter: [appears with a halo and angel clothing on] Dudes! He made me experience high tide! [floats up towards the surface while laughing] 
Tom: He poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses! 
Protesters: He did? 
Tom: No... But are we just gonna wait around until he does? 
Mr. Krabs: I say we tip something over! [all yelling] 
Lifeguard: Hey, hey, hey! [everyone tips the lifeguard stand] 
Protester: Now what? 
Protesters: Get the lifeguard! [they go to the lifeguard, but Squidward stops them] 
Squidward: Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems! [holds up a needle] Who's with me? 
Protesters: [all hold a needle] Pop the bubble! [all yelling] 
SpongeBob: [everybody surrounds them] Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy? 
Protesters: Yes... 
SpongeBob: Hey, is this one of those sewing circles? 
Protesters: No... [group steps in closer] 
SpongeBob: Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable. 
Larry: SpongeBob, that bubble's got to go. 
SpongeBob: Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern. 
Pearl: No. "Go" as in... [blows a bubble gum until it pops] 
SpongeBob: [screams] Why?! 
Mr. Krabs: You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it! 
SpongeBob: No! I won't let you! [blows Bubble Buddy until they begin floating] Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never! [both start to get lower to the ground and the group surrounds them both again] Never... 
Squidward: Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble! 
Protesters: Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! 
SpongeBob: No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend? 
Mr. Krabs: [starts crying] Nickel Buddy, I'll never spend you! 
Sheldon: Funny Muffler... 
Larry: Jerky Pal... 
Harold: Boo-boo Keys... 
Man: Snake Eyes... [together with Harold] We love you! [burst into tears] 
SpongeBob: So, what do you say? 
Protesters: [look at each other, then they bring out their needles] Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! [throw SpongeBob away] 
Squidward: Let's get this over with so I can go home and play my clarinet! 
SpongeBob: Noo... [Squidward charges his needle towards Bubble Buddy in a slow dramatic manner, while SpongeBob begs them to stop. But then suddenly Bubble Buddy grabs ahold of Squidward's hand before the needle reaches the former] 
Bubble Buddy: Whoa! [all except SpongeBob gasp] Hey, don't I get a say in this? I'll see you later, SpongeBob. Things are getting a little weird around here. 
SpongeBob: So long. [Bubble Buddy gets into a bubble taxi and it floats away as it drives off] 
Bubble Buddy: Happy Leif Erikson Day! 
Squidward: He's alive? 
SpongeBob: Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes! [laughs as everyone walks off muttering and agreeing with Bubble Buddy's departure] Seems like only this morning I held his bottle. [sniffles] They blow up so fast. [weeps tears of joy while blowing his nose and runs off. A bunch of bubbles pop near Squidward except for one] 
Squidward: [thinking bubble is alive like Bubble Buddy] Uh...hi?


[Squidward is dressed in island clothes and playing the piano on an island (the future version of Bikini Bottom). He hits one of the notes, but realizes it's a sour note and he keeps hitting it. The sound is coming from SpongeBob hitting a bell.]
Dream SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward! [Squidward wakes up from his dream while his alarm clock goes off. Cuts to Squidward driving to work. Zooms in on one of his bumper stickers that reads "Don't Ask Me About My Day." Squidward blearily looks up from his steering wheel to prepare himself for the day ahead. He walks up to the front doors and SpongeBob follows him from inside, smiling. Squidward walks inside]
SpongeBob: Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me? [Squidward walks inside without saying a word] Okay, see you later, Squidinator.
Mr. Krabs: Good morning, Mr. Squidward. [Raises his eyebrows; Squidward sticks out his tongue] So, are you ready?
Squidward: To go home?
Mr. Krabs: No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards... [points at SpongeBob] ...that guy! [SpongeBob is washing a table with a buffer. He scrubs his face and gets it scrambled. He laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for ye.
SpongeBob: Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift. [holds up a sweater] Ta-dah. [zooms in to show it's a picture of a heart with Squidward's face on it]
Squidward: "I Heart you..."
Mr. Krabs: Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it. [laughs as Squidward has a hard time putting the sweater over his head]
SpongeBob: I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size. [Squidward gets the sweater over his head] Do you love it?
Squidward: [starts scratching the sweater] It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of? [cut to SpongeBob with no eyelashes or eyebrows]
SpongeBob: Eyelashes! [Squidward throws the sweater at SpongeBob, causing him to whimper]
Squidward: Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?
Mr. Krabs: After you present your brotherhood gift.
Squidward: I'll buy the little twerp a Gumball.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift.
Squidward: [walks to the doors] The only thing I'm making is for the exit. [opens up the door to see SpongeBob with a new sweater made out of a clear liquid]
SpongeBob: Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears. [sniffs. Squidward sighs and walks towards the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice.
Squidward: Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?
Captain: Heave-ho! [Squidward looks and sees some pirates outside carrying some pies onto the ship] If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!
Squidward: Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.
Pirate: Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs.
Squidward: Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one. [holds up money]
Captain: Wait! [jumps down off the ship] We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please.
Squidward: So, what flavor is it?
Pirates: [all talking at once] Cherry. Apple. Raspberry.
Squidward: Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back. [Squidward gives the pirate the money. Cut to Squidward placing the pie on Mr. Krabs' desk] Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.
Mr. Krabs: Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right. [about to put a piece in his mouth] Wait a second... this would go great with some milk! [while walking to the milk, he trips over a book and the piece of pie flies into the milk, causing an explosion] So, you tried to kill me over a little new age management, eh?
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain! [cut to inside Mr. Krabs' office]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie! [looks at the card attached to it] It's from Squidward. [reading] "To SpongeBob... Well, here you go."
Squidward: And that's what happened!
Mr. Krabs: 25 dollars?! A bomb?!
Squidward &amp; Mr. Krabs: [shouting] In the Krusty Krab?! [both run back into the office but the pie is not there]
Mr. Krabs: That's where you left it.
Squidward: It's not there.
SpongeBob: Hey guys. [licks his fingers then rubs his tummy] Thanks for the pie, Squidward. [sings] La, la, lalalalalala. [skips out]
Mr. Krabs: You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears... and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?
Squidward: Kill him? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob taking a tray to a customer]
SpongeBob: Here's your order, sir.
Customer: Thanks. [SpongeBob explodes and pieces of SpongeBob fly everywhere; back to reality]
Squidward: No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!
Mr. Krabs: Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!
Squidward: You've seen this before?
Mr. Krabs: Eleven times as a matter of fact. [Squidward runs over to a phone and dials the hospital]
Squidward: Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times? [hangs up] Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him? [both look out the window and see SpongeBob cheerfully wiping off a table, apparently having forgotten about the earlier incident]
Mr. Krabs: Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours. [walks away]
Squidward: [tears up] You're right, Mr. Krabs! [sobs] I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it. [opens the door then turns around, smiling] Drown in it! [walks out]
Mr. Krabs: [writes on a notepad] Note to self: Watch out for Squidward. [Cut to Squidward walking over to SpongeBob, who is singing happily and wiping the table]
Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [sing-songy] Yes?
Squidward: I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift.
SpongeBob: Part two? [bounces up and down] Part two, part two, part two, part two... [Squidward grabs him]
Squidward: Please, don't do that.
SpongeBob: What's the part two?
Squidward: Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of? [SpongeBob takes out a list]
SpongeBob: Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list.
Squidward: Great. Uh, let me see it. [looks at the list]
SpongeBob: The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.
Squidward: Everything's in red.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I know.
Squidward: We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.
SpongeBob: Then let's roll! [both walk out] Bye, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs cries and puts a "Help Wanted" sign in the window] Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you.
Squidward: Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.
SpongeBob: Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to a businessman] Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to some kids] Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward. [one of the kids throws a rock at Squidward's head. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking up to a fish sitting on a bench] Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward.
Squidward: Hey, Frank. [montage ends] Glad that's over.
SpongeBob: Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity.
Squidward: Which is...?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.
Squidward: You're gonna be wearing a salmon suit?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one Squidward! [cut to Squidward in a salmon suit in front of some kids. All the kids throw rocks at him. Cut to SpongeBob checking off the item on his list] Next. [SpongeBob and Squidward sit by a rock] Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.
Squidward: Who's there?
SpongeBob: I am! [laughs]
Squidward: [laughs weakly] Oh, yeah... [SpongeBob checks the knock-knock jokes off his list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking backwards]
SpongeBob: [imitates the beeping of a back up alarm] Look out, everyone, friends in reverse! [continues beeping. SpongeBob checks off this item off the list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward making noises with their tongues out of their mouths while moving their hands back and forth in front of their face. SpongeBob checks the item off his list. Cut to Squidward walking with SpongeBob as his face]
SpongeBob: Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.
Squidward:  [muffled] I can't breathe. [SpongeBob checks that off his list. Cut to SpongeBob performing open-heart surgery on Squidward]
Squidward: Are you sure you should be poking it like that?
SpongeBob: Who's the doctor here? [heart squirts blood. SpongeBob checks his operation off the list as well as some other items while he laughs] The last thing on the list is...
Squidward: [with a bandage over his heart] Does it involve more dismemberment?
SpongeBob: Watch the sunset with Squidward.
Squidward: Sunset? [thinks about what Mr. Krabs said earlier in a thought balloon]
Mr. Krabs: The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.
SpongeBob: Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs cries and runs off] Okay, see you later.
Squidward: C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.
SpongeBob: Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me, [a brick wall is shown between the two] ...and this brick wall that you built between us.
Squidward: Yeah. [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob exploding]
Squidward: Explosions... I mean, erosion. 
SpongeBob: You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay. [Squidward tears up. SpongeBob burps] Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine. [smells the aroma] Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry? [the sun starts to go down] Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.
Squidward: Four... three... two... one... [nothing happens]
SpongeBob: I guess we started too early. Let's start again.
Squidward: Five... four... three... [an explosion is heard from behind the wall] two... [cries] o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful. [he sighs] I am such a good person. [another explosion is seen behind the wall but this time, it knocks the brick wall down on top of Squidward. SpongeBob is blowing some bomb-shaped bubbles]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out! [Squidward gets up and mutters] Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.
Squidward: Why are you still here?!
SpongeBob: Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one. [holds up a book that says "Friends 4 Ever"] I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.
Squidward: [slaps book away] Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!
SpongeBob: You want me to explode?
Squidward: Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!
SpongeBob: Um, okay, I'll try. [grunts and then yells] Gary! You are gonna finish your desert, and you are gonna like it! [laughs] Now it's your turn!
Squidward: [yells and stomps on the ground] That's not what I meant you barnacle head!
SpongeBob: Oh, good one.
Squidward: No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces! [he flaps his arms]
SpongeBob: Why would I do that?
Squidward: Because the pie you ate was a bomb!
SpongeBob: What pie?
Squidward: The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!
SpongeBob: Pie...pie... [takes out a pie] Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat! [walks forward and trips on a rock] Oops! [pie flies into Squidward's face in slow-motion causing an explosion the size of an atomic bomb]
Squidward: [now in the destroyed town] Ouch. [fade to black, episode ends]


Narrator: Ah, Sandy Cheeks is going out of town and has asked SpongeBob and Patrick to do a little pet-sitting for her. [inside the dome are a few animals in cages and/or jars]
Patrick: Pet-sitting? Won't that hurt them? [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a bird cage]
Narrator: Perhaps she should have asked someone else. [Patrick whistles at the bird]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird.
Patrick: No, that's Italian, SpongeBob. [Sandy puts a big sack down]
Sandy: Okay boys, this here is Birdy's food. Feed him twice a day.
SpongeBob: This whole sack?
Sandy: No, just a cup's worth. [all walk over to a cricket] This here's my cricket. [the cricket makes noises] He's saying hello to you. Ain't he cute?
SpongeBob: Uh sorry, I don't speak Italian.
Sandy: And this here's Snakey. [holds up the snake that has a mouse in its belly]
SpongeBob: What's that lump in its belly?
Sandy: Well, that's his dinner. [SpongeBob pokes it and the mouse laughs] Well, I guess that's it. I gotta go. [walks off with a suitcase] See you guys in a couple of days.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bye, Sandy! [notices the worm in a jar]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Wait! You forgot about this pet!
Sandy: Oh, that's only Wormy. He don't eat much. [walks out]
SpongeBob: Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella.
Patrick: Kitchie-kitchie koo, koo.
SpongeBob: Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play. [cut to SpongeBob playing hide-n-seek and counting] 998, 999, 1,000. Ready or not, here I come! [turns around and takes the table cover off of Patrick's head]
Patrick: You found me. [both look for Wormy, who is on a leaf]
SpongeBob and Patrick: There you are! [cuts to Sponge and Pat hiding behind a tree. Wormy pops up behind it] He found us! [they laugh]
Patrick: Gee, SpongeBob, I don't want today to end ever.
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy. [puts a 'Best Friend' ribbon on Wormy] Our new best friend. [puts Wormy back in his jar] Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy. We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun.
Patrick: Why must the sun set on this perfect day? Sleep well, Wormy. [Patrick cries as they both walk home]
SpongeBob: Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. It's only until tomorrow.
[cut to the Bikini Atoll island as day turns into night. Meanwhile, back at Sandy's treedome, a now live-action Wormy sheds his skin one last time, turns himself into a chrysalis, then emerges from said chrysalis, now as a butterfly. The next morning, the rooster crows and SpongeBob wakes up.]
SpongeBob: Here I come, Wormy! [Patrick pokes his head out of SpongeBob's alarm clock]
Patrick: Me, too! [both run off to Sandy's with their water helmets already on] And then we're gonna play tag, and then we're gonna color, and then we're gonna build a house of cards!
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're back, Wormy! Wormy, Wormy? [holds up the jar with Wormy in it, who is now a butterfly]
Patrick: Wormy? Where's Wormy? What's that thing?
SpongeBob: He's gotta be in here. [he opens up the jar, causing Wormy to fly out] I think something bad happened to Wormy. [the best friend ribbon is still in the jar]
Patrick: He left his "Best Friend" ribbon behind!
[the butterfly flies onto SpongeBob's helmet. Cue a live-action close-up of a buzzing horsefly's face. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run behind Sandy's table.]
Patrick: What is that thing?! [the butterfly is on the tree]
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy!
Patrick: [In tears] Why does this keep happening to me?!
SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick! We've gotta make a run for the door! [They start to run to the exit but the butterfly flies in front of the door] No! Patrick, it’s blocking our only exit! [They begin to run backwards to the back of Sandy's tree]
Patrick: Now what? We're trapped in here with that... that... "Best Friend Eater!"
SpongeBob: Let's not panic. We just have to stick together. Remember, it's two against one. Right, Patrick? Patrick? [He sees Patrick gone and the butterfly flying at him and shrieks] It’s eaten Patrick! [He runs away and jumps in a barrel and sees Patrick in it] Patrick, you're alive!
Patrick: I am?
SpongeBob: Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house. It might eat Sandy's other pets!
Patrick: Or worse, it might eat Sandy's pets.
SpongeBob: No, it might eat Sandy! We've gotta get it out of here!
[We see SpongeBob and Patrick hiding behind Sandy's table and Sandy's phone in a jar to trap the butterfly and the phone begins to ring.]
Patrick: It's for you! [The butterfly begins to fly by the jar]
SpongeBob: It's working. It’s gonna answer it. [But instead the butterfly just flies past the jar and the lid closes]
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
[Then we see Patrick on a plate with an apple in his mouth]
SpongeBob: You look pretty appetizing, Patrick. Now, just stay here and wait for the monster. I'll go get the net. [He walks off and the butterfly begins to fly by and land on Patrick's butt which makes Patrick feel scared]
Patrick: [Whimpering, spitting out the apple] SpongeBob! Hurry up with that net!
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick! [He searches through Sandy's trunk for the net.]
Patrick: I really don't taste that good, Monster. [Wormy crawls down Patrick's helmet. Patrick sees the butterfly close-up and runs off screaming. SpongeBob runs by with the net]
SpongeBob: I'm coming, Patrick! [Patrick goes right through the net, tearing it up, and crashes into the tree, causing some acorns to fall into his helmet. SpongeBob sees his broken net as Wormy corners him] No, Monster, please don't eat me! No, no, no! Spare me, I don't taste good, no! Please! Wait a second. [takes out a bottle of bubbles and blows one to get Wormy stuck in one] Yeah! [Wormy flies out of the treedome, still in the bubble. Patrick shuts the door behind Wormy] We did it, Patrick! Sandy's gonna be so proud of us. We got that horrible monster out of her house and best of all her pets are safe. 'Cause that horrible creature is now...[Wormy flies to the Krusty Krab]...heading straight for the Krusty Krab! [both run off] It's going in the front! Let's use the secret entrance. [both go inside a rock and then appear inside the Krusty Krab in another rock. They gasp as Wormy flies toward Squidward and Mr. Krabs, who are taking pictures]
Squidward: Okay, hold still.
Patrick: It's gonna eat Squidward and Mr. Krabs! [both jump at them]
SpongeBob: Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Say "money."
Mr. Krabs: "Money!" [Squidward takes the picture. It reveals SpongeBob and Patrick jumping on top of Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: What's the meaning of this, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there.
Mr. Krabs: Is it a paying customer?
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties. It wants to eat YOU!
Patrick: [crying] Just like it ate Wormy!
Squidward: Um, Wormy? [SpongeBob and Patrick cry]
SpongeBob: Why? Why? He was so young.
Patrick: We’ll never forget you, Wormy.
Squidward: Well, if Moron Theater's over, I'm just going to take a look at this monster. [Wormy flies in a bubble] That's the monster?
Patrick: Pretty scary, huh?
SpongeBob: A living nightmare!
Squidward: I should have known. [walks away] Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express.
Mr. Krabs: Now just 'cause you swabs never seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous.
SpongeBob: We tried to warn them. I can't watch. [pushes his eyes into his head]
Squidward: Get a load of the scary monster. [laughs] Monster.
Mr. Krabs: Aww, it looks harmless...
Squidward: It's kinda cute.
Mr. Krabs: It reminds me of money!
Squidward: Monster. [both laugh until they see the butterfly up-close and personal. Squidward and Mr. Krabs scream as their teeth and eyes fall out and they both run away.]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Patrick: Mr. Krabs? [SpongeBob screams when he sees their underwear and hat only]
SpongeBob: [screams] It ate them! And there it goes! [Wormy flies out of the Krusty Krab] First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs! [has three finger puppets for each person] That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must inform the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The faith of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll.
Patrick: Aye-aye, captain. [pushes a lever to make the boat sail out of the Krusty Krab. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick on the streets]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity.
Patrick: Gotcha.
SpongeBob: Run, everybody, run!
Patrick: Monster on the loose!
SpongeBob: Monster! [everyone runs away screaming. SpongeBob and Patrick give each other a thumbs up. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick putting up a sign of the butterfly saying "Beware" when a crowd of citizens runs by screaming. Wormy flies by and SpongeBob and Patrick hide in the bucket of glue and bounce off. Cut to SpongeBob inflating a balloon but then inhales the air in the balloon so he can float in the sky.]
Patrick: [using a megaphone] Attention, Bikini Bottom! There's a flying monster that's going to eat you!
Fish #1, Gerbil, TV Fish, and Fish #2:  A monster?! [everyone screams and runs away. Cut to SpongeBob waving his arms and horrifyingly pointing at Wormy flying by. Everybody runs off, and in the commotion, a lamppost gets knocked over and the whole city is set on fire.]
Realistic Fish Head: Attention, attention! This just in! [TV shows a real monarch butterfly] A giant monster is attacking Bikini Bottom. [a man watching the announcement swallows his eyes and has them appear in his mouth when he screams. He runs through the wall]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved the city! [In the background, a meteor flies down and destroys a building] Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster.
Patrick: About the what? [just then, Wormy flies by. SpongeBob, Patrick, and everyone else run away from Wormy, but Wormy always finds them no matter where they go. Eventually, the crowd stops at a traffic light to allow another crowd through. The first crowd passes as well, and soon enough, Wormy stops at the light, too. The crowd runs inside of a building, and Wormy enters as well. In the struggle to get out, all of the citizens are ejected through the chimney. Cut to the crowd running. As SpongeBob screams, his mouth engulfs the camera. Bikini Bottom's welcome sign snaps in half, and a "Beware" poster drifts through the wind. Then, a bus drops off Sandy. Sandy sees the destroyed town.]
Sandy: Shoot! Looks like a twister hit this place. Where is everybody? [Wormy flies by] Oh, hey there Wormy. [puts him in a jar] You weren't supposed to change till I got back. That oughta hold ya, little guy. [everyone runs up to Sandy, SpongeBob also gives Sandy a hug.] Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Sandy caught the monster! [everyone cheers and picks up SpongeBob and Sandy and bring them into town]
Sandy: I didn't know I'd be missed so much. Golly, maybe I should go out of town more often.


[Episode starts with the Krusty Krab. Inside, it is dirty and covered in cobwebs. Squidward is seen covered in dust and cobwebs. He blows the dust off himself. SpongeBob dusts off a cobweb off a table with a feather duster. A spider comes down and makes a new web. SpongeBob dusts it off again, but the spider comes back and makes another one. Mr. Krabs is seen covered in dust against the wall. He sneezes the dust off.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah-ah-achoo! [sighs] 36 days without a customer.
Dave: [slowly crawls towards the Krusty Krab] So... hungry...
SpongeBob: Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer!
Mr. Krabs: Ah! [Krabs squeals in delight, revealing a spider web growing in his mouth. A spider crawls all over it]
Dave: No food... 3 days...
Mr. Krabs: Hold on, me bucko! Food's on the way! [He is about to call into the kitchen, but then has a second thought] Uhh... You got money, right?
Dave: Yeah...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Bring this guy some grub before he keels over!
SpongeBob: [offers him food] Here you go, sir.
Dave: Oh. Krabby Patties, huh?
Mr. Krabs: Finest under the sea!
Dave: Yeah, yeah, sure. But where's the pizzazz?
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Dave: I mean look at this place. [the inside of the Krusty Krab is all old and worn out] I mean... what is the theme here? Underwater? It's boring. [He turns and crawls away] Foooood... water... atmosphere...
Mr. Krabs: Nobody goes to a restaurant for atmosphere. [runs to the door] They go for food! [he looks out the door as Fred and Tom see each other on the street]
Fred: Hey, Tom!
Tom: Fred! Hey, you wanna eat at the Krusty Krab?
Fred: Nah. Let's go to the Shell Shack. They've got a talking dog!
Tom: [runs off with Fred] Great! Say, what's a dog?
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] Money walking! I need to think up a gimmick like that to bring people back in here!
SpongeBob: [peeks through Mr. Krabs' eye stalks] I have an idea! [Mr. Krabs' eye stalks pull back together, chopping SpongeBob in half]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I've got an idea! [Cut to outside the Krusty Krab, where a marching band plays, and a crowd gathers around Mr. Krabs] ...And so ladies and gentlemen, be sure to buy plenty of Krabby Patties as I bury myself alive! [Everyone cheers and confetti shoots up from the ground as Mr. Krabs wields a shovel. He digs a hole, and then hops into it] No free refills. [scene cuts. Then, he pats the dirt in around him, leaving himself underground with no trace of him. Fred runs up to on top of where Krabs was buried]
Fred: Hey, everyone, listen! [the music stops] The talking dog at the Shell Shack is SINGING!!! Come on!
[He motions for everyone to follow, and they do, leaving Mr. Krabs alone, under the ground. Cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab, where it has been cleaned out]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: What am I going to do? If I don't find an idea, I'll go out of business!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: Why can't someone give me an idea?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: [looks above] Great Neptune in Heaven, I need an idea!!!
[A divine light hits Krabs, and SpongeBob comes down, playing the harp and dressed like an angel]
Angel SpongeBob: [singing] Mr. KraaAAaaaAAAbbs! I haAave an ideeeaaaaAAaa!
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] What in the name of money are you waiting for, boy? Tell me!
SpongeBob: OK. Mr. Krabs, Prepare yourself. Don't bother sitting down, because you'll just stand up when you see this! [makes a Pretty Patty] Ta-da! [Shows Mr. Krabs a green Krabby Patty]
Mr. Krabs: Great Barrier Reef! That patty's spoiled!
[He knocks it off of the plate and onto the ground, where he burns it with a flame thrower. Once the fire is gone, SpongeBob appears in a fire-retardant suit]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Mr. Krabs, it's not tainted meat. It's painted meat [Fire once again overcomes him, and he emerges in regular clothing, with an artist's pallet in hand. On the palette, Krabby Patties lie in different colors] Pretty Patties! Available in 6 designer colors.
[short pause then Mr. Krabs laughs, and SpongeBob looks broken-heartedly at his own creation]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! Come look!
[Squidward walks up, smiling mockingly]
Mr. Krabs: [jokingly] Don't that look appetizing?
Squidward: Mmm, mmm!!! Good, sir!
[Both laughing]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Gimme an orange patty... with extra purple!
[Squidward laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What's next? [holds up a milkshake cup with sequins and encrusted into it] Sequin milkshakes?
Squidward: [holds up a French fry with a bow-tie on] Bow-tie French fries?
SpongeBob: [Welding with tears] No.
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs dance mockingly while Squidward chants "Pretty Patties! Pretty Patties!"]
SpongeBob: [Crying] Stop it! [SpongeBob becomes indignant] I know this is a good idea. I'll show you! I'll... I'll... I'll open my own restaurant! [He runs out of the Krusty Krab] You'll see!
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs look at each other, then they continue laughing. Cut to Conch Street]
SpongeBob: [angrily approaches an angry Patrick] Hey, Patrick, are you angry, too!?
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: What's the matter?
Patrick: I can't see my forehead. What's your problem?
SpongeBob: I have a good idea, and no one else thinks so.
Patrick: [no longer angry, and a cord appears from his shorts] Me too. [he pulls the cord, causing his shorts to inflate and lift into the air a few feet. Patrick is floating upside-down] Inflatable pants! What's your idea?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna open up a restaurant and sell Pretty Patties!
Patrick: [his shorts explode, leaving him with only a piece of his shorts covering his crotch] Forget my dumb idea, that's great!
[Cut to later, where SpongeBob has constructed a purple stand that says "Pretty Patties." Patrick is behind a second one to the left of SpongeBob that is brown and says "Pay Here"]
SpongeBob: Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick? [Patrick looks down and pulls up his purple-and-green trunks and gives SpongeBob the thumbs-up] Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open. [He puts up an "Open" sign. Cut to him at the stand] I'm ready! [He is an adult with the same camera angling. He has glasses on, and brown hair. His pineapple begins to rot] I'm ready. [He is an old man with a long, gray beard. His pineapple wilts and dies] I'm ready... [His gravestone behind the stand says "R.I.P. I'M READY." There is a vacant spot where his pineapple previously was. SpongeBob wakes up at the stand and sees that that was a dream] Patrick! How long have we been standing here?!?
Patrick: [looks at the sloppily-drawn crayon marks on his wrist made to look like a watch] Uhh... I gotta draw a new battery for this! [scribbles on his wrist with a blue crayon]
SpongeBob: What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb. [cries]
Patrick: SpongeBob, sometimes, we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems.
SpongeBob: I'm scared.
Patrick: Then I'm going in for you! [climbs into SpongeBob's head through one of his pores. Then, SpongeBob inflates like a puffer fish]
Patrick: Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants! [flies out of SpongeBob and lands headfirst on the ground]
SpongeBob: Did you find anything?
Patrick: Huh?
Harold: [walks up to the stand] Hey, do you sell food here?
[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle, making Harold feel awkward]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties! [holds out a green Pretty Patty]
Harold: That thing's green! [starts laughing hysterically] Green! [laughs some more]
Patrick: [laughs as well, but doesn't laugh hard at all] Green. [SpongeBob cries]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs was right! What am I going to do with all these? [holds out the palette of Pretty Patties]
Harold: [Stops laughing] Hey, is that one purple? Purple is my favorite color! [He tries it] This isn't half bad! Hey, world! "Pretty Patties" is the best idea ever! [SpongeBob and Patrick are elated]
[Cut to Mr. Krabs in his office, eating popcorn and watching a movie, crying. A spider dangling from its web cries as well]
Rick's Wife: [On TV] Oh, Rick, how could you? Together we were one.
Rick: [On TV] That was before. But now, I'm splitting us up.
[Onscreen, an amoeba splits into two amoebas. All of a sudden, it turns to a Bikini Bottom News emergency broadcast. Johnny talks at a desk. Behind him is a bamboo screen showing a crowd of Bikini Bottom citizens cheering]
Johnny: We interrupt this program to bring you a special news announcement! This wild crowd behind me is screaming for Bikini Bottom's latest culinary sensation. Let's take a listen.
All: [Chanting] Pretty Patties! Pretty Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Pretty Patties? [The spider comes down and steal Mr. Krabs' popcorn]
Johnny: It's easy to see Pretty Patties are popular, but what is it about them that drives Bikini Bottom feeders wild?
Millie, Sadie [has hair], and Evelyn: [we see Millie, Sadie Rechid and Evelyn on screen, who hold out their purses to compare with the Pretty Patties] They match our purses!
Scottish Man: [with Scottish accent, kilt, and bagpipe] They remind me of home. [holds up a plaid Pretty Patty and Larry runs up]
Larry: Pretty Patties rule! [flexes his muscles]
Johnny: Mr. SquarePants, how do you explain all this success?
SpongeBob: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... I don't know.
Mr. Krabs: How can you make money with such a stupid idea?
Johnny: [the TV background has money falling] And how can you not make money with such a brilliant idea?
SpongeBob: [laughs] At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it... [Mr. Krabs' eyestalks inflate] ...shredding it... [Krabs' eyestalks inflate some more] ...and burning it! [Mr. Krabs's eyestalks burst and fly around like a balloon with a hole in it as he screams] But in the end, we decided just to give it all away.
[Patrick is at this stand that now has a bamboo "$" and says "FREE MONEY." He hands a filled paper sack to Nathiel]
Patrick: Come again, sir!
Nathiel: I'm getting back in line! [runs off]
Mr. Krabs: I don't believe it! [runs out of his office and across the dining area] I've got to see this for me self! [runs out the door and into Sandals]
Sandals: Hey Watch it, buddy. I don't care how much you want your Pretty Patty. You're gonna have to wait in line [shows Krabs the very long line] like the rest of us.
Mr. Krabs: I've never had a line.
[At SpongeBob's stand, the "Now Serving" sign flips to 46,853]
SpongeBob: Who's #46,853?
[An enormous amount of people surround them and they simultaneously declare themselves as #46,853. Mr. Krabs makes his way to the front of the line]
Mr. Krabs: [surprised] I never had 46,853 customers.
SpongeBob: [hands a Pretty Patty to an anchovy] Here you are, sir. Stay pretty. [he laughs] All right. [notices Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs smiles nervously] The Pretty Patties are a big hit.
Mr. Krabs: They sure are, boy. You're doing pretty well for yourself. I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: [gets an idea, then he smiles smugly] I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs? [demonstrates rubbing two pickles together] That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... Yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab's only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down. For old time's sake. [takes SpongeBob by the hand and starts to walk away, but SpongeBob's arm expands and he just stays in the same place]
SpongeBob: Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, lad. I'll watch the stand for ye. [SpongeBob retracts his arm]
SpongeBob: You will?
Mr. Krabs: No, I've got a better idea! I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands- for keeps! An in exchange, I'll give ya the Krusty Krab! With Squidward, the grill, and all those squeaky pickles!
SpongeBob: [In a trance] What did you say, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Here's the key to the Krusty Krab. [gives SpongeBob the key, which is composed of 2 K's and a ring] She's yours now.
SpongeBob: [receives the key, while still in a trance] Thank... you... what should I do now, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Run to her, boy. She's waiting for ya.
SpongeBob: I can't feel my legs, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, boy! I'll fix it! [grabs SpongeBob and tosses him to the crowd] Get this to the Krusty Krab on the double! Good luck, lad!
SpongeBob: [while crowd-surfing, SpongeBob's surroundings turn into a pink sky with clouds] Dreams do come true! [gets thrown to the ground]
[SpongeBob floats up and kisses the building. He cheers in the dining area, kiss the floor, throw buns up into the air in the kitchen, laugh over the phone in Mr. Krabs' office, and stand at the ordering boat, the whole Krusty Krab cleaned and refreshed. Cut back to the Pretty Patties stand]
Mr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen! "Pretty Patties" is now under new management! [holds a green Pretty Patty] Who's next? [the crowd cheers]
[A sea-level shot of the Bikini Atoll Island. It turns from night to dawn and the rooster crows everyone up. Cut to Mr. Krabs at the stand beside SpongeBob's house. The "Free Money" stand has been disassembled]
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready...For me money. [the crowd gathers around him, all looking angry] Welcome to Pretty Patties. May I take your money?
Franco: [high-pitched voice] We want a refund, Krabs. [crowd yelling in agreement]
Mr. Krabs: [confused and scared as he turns his head three times] Who, huh, What?
Gus: Your dumb Pretty Patties turned my [shows his purple face] face purple!
Scottish Man: [Scottish accent] Look what I got under my kilt! [raises his kilt to reveal a plaid body, and white underwear]
Clay, John, and Frank: And look at our tongues! [they show Mr. Krabs their respective tongues: a yellow tongue, a speckled tongue, and a normal-looking pink tongue]
Mr. Krabs: [confused as he refers to Frank's tongue while sweating] What's wrong with you?
Frank: [turns off a light to reveal his tongue is glow-in-the-dark, and is pulsing green] We want our money back. All 46,853 of us. [turns the light back on, but Mr. Krabs is nowhere to be seen]
Harold: Hey, where'd he go?
[Cut to Mr. Krabs screaming and running away]
Crowd: Get him! [crowd yelling, chases Krabs, with a rainbow trailing behind them]
Mr. Krabs: [panting...]" Oof! "[slams on the Krusty Krab door but it's locked] My key! [checks his pocket for the key but it's not there] Where's my key?! [recalls he gave it to SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [he quickly bangs the door to get SpongeBob's attention] SpongeBob, let me in! [inside the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is too busy happily rubbing the two pickles together, making a squeaking sound] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [Mr. Krabs tries to get SpongeBob's attention from outside] SpongeBob! Let me in! [SpongeBob cannot hear due to his pickle-squeaking. Krabs screams as he is chased left and right by the mob, still vainly yelling for SpongeBob's attention. Crowd yelling] SpongeBob!


[SpongeBob is standing on a hill looking at his grandma's house]
SpongeBob: There it is! Grandma's house! What wonders await me today? Fresh-baked cookies? Story time? A sweater with love in every stitch? Aw, what am I waiting for? [runs down the hill] Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!
Grandma: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi, Grandma! [hugs her as the two walk into the kitchen]
Grandma: Come in and sit for a while. [gives SpongeBob a plate of cookies] Have a cookie, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea. [grabs a cookie and dips it in a glass of  milk] Oh yeah... [eats it. His eyes turn into cookies] Grandma's cookies...
Grandma: Now, who wants to lick the spoon? [SpongeBob raises his hand]
SpongeBob: Me, me, me! [cut to Grandma telling SpongeBob a story while he licks the spoon]
Grandma: ...and then we drove all the way home with all the windows down in the freezing cold.
SpongeBob: Tell me another story about when I was a baby. [cuckoo clock strikes three. SpongeBob gasps] Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work!
Grandma: Hop in my car, I'll drop you off. [cut to Grandma driving up to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Grandma! [hops out of the car]
Grandma: SpongeBob, you forgot your kissy-kissy! [SpongeBob turns around and heads back to Grandma. Squidward is watching from the window]
SpongeBob: I sure did. [Grandma gives him a kiss, leaving a pink print on his forehead of her lips] Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride. [Squidward opens the door for SpongeBob] Thank you, Squidward. [walks inside while whistling to some laughing from everyone] Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today.
Squidward: I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you.
SpongeBob: Did I do something funny?
Squidward: Your forehead. [points to the kiss]
SpongeBob: My forehead is funny?
Charlie: Hey, hey, Grandma's boy? Kissy-kissy-kissy! [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma.
Charlie: No, especially if you're a big baby who wears diapers! [everyone laughs] And sucks his thumb, and plays with dolls, and, um... [soon, everyone stops laughing] ...wears pajamas with feet in 'em, and carries his, um... blankie around, and...
Customers: All right already!
Squidward: Cheer up, SpongeBob. I know someone who still likes you.
SpongeBob: Really? You do, Squidward?
Squidward: Yeah, your grandma! [everyone laughs. SpongeBob tries getting the kiss off with his hand and a mop but nothing seems to work. Everyone is still laughing at him]
All: HaHaHaHaHaHa!!!
SpongeBob: STOOOOOP IIIIIIIIT! [everyone stops] I have been publicly humiliated for the last time! [runs home crying. Fade to SpongeBob's house]
Patrick: I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Me, too.
Patrick: You're the most adult person I know.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick: You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her.
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick.
Patrick: Have I ever not been right? [cut to a picture of SpongeBob on a giant red firecracker, a picture of SpongeBob with a giant funnel in his mouth while Patrick holds a giant pumpkin, and a picture of SpongeBob and Patrick in black speedos while a wolf whistle is heard in the background] You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one.
SpongeBob: Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how.
Patrick: Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest. [SpongeBob obediently puffs out his chest] Now say, "tax exemption!"
SpongeBob: "Tax exemption!"
Patrick: Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz. [jazz music plays] ...Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready! [cut to both walking up on the hill facing Grandma's house] This is it. What are you gonna tell Grandma?
SpongeBob: I'm a grown up!
Patrick: No ifs, ands, or buts about it!
SpongeBob: A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do!
Patrick: And then you get behind her and I'll push!
SpongeBob: Patrick, we didn't say that!!!
Patrick: Oh yeah, right.
SpongeBob: All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake. [takes out a suitcase] I've been growing these babies for years...! [opens it to reveal sideburns. Both of them take a pair and put them on]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Sideburns! [SpongeBob knocks on Grandma's door]
Grandma: [opens door] Oh, hello, SpongeBob. What a nice surprise. Come here and give your Granny her kissy-kissy. [as she is about to kiss him, SpongeBob puts on a helmet to block it]
SpongeBob: [removes his "Kisses Not Allowed" helmet off his head] Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop.
Patrick: Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff.
SpongeBob: He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way.
Grandma: Oh, you are absolutely right.
SpongeBob: I am? I mean, of course I am.
Grandma: You will definitely not be treated like a baby around here anymore ever again.
SpongeBob: I am glad you see it my way, grandmother. [puts on a hat]
Grandma: Well, I'm glad that's settled. [holds out a tray of cookies] But what am I going to do with all these fresh baked cookies?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat... [notices Patrick isn't there] ...rick? [cut to Patrick sitting at the kitchen table]
Patrick: Keep 'em coming, Granny! [scarfs down the cookies as SpongeBob watches from a window]
SpongeBob: So much for no more baby stuff.
Grandma: And don't forget the cookie-eating hat! [puts a red hat with springs attached to yellow smiley faces on top of Patrick's head. They both laugh]
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby.[growls in frustration] [knocks on the door. His Grandma opens it]
Grandma: Well, look who's here. It's my big old adult grandson.
SpongeBob: Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick. [runs up to Patrick, who still eats his snack] [whispering loudly] Patrick! What are you doing?! Cookies?! Warm milk?! A bib?! [points to it, which reads "I heart Grandma"] Is that a kissy mark on your forehead?! We are supposed to be adults! [bangs on the table]
Grandma: Oh, oh, no roughhousing with a full tummy. [tickles Patrick] Who's the baby?
Patrick: I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby! [SpongeBob clears his throat] Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you. [takes out a pipe and blows bubbles from it] Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup. [Grandma comes back with more cookies]
Grandma: Here's a fresh batch of cookies.
Patrick: All right! [eats them] Rewards, huh?
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, there's, eh... [sees Patrick eating cookies with his mouth open] well, let's see, we... [a cookie rolls over to his side] We went over the jazz... [Patrick grabs the cookie and eats it]
Patrick: Oh, Grandma, I'm full. [Grandma sets down another plate of cookies]
Grandma: More cookies! [Patrick uses his mouth like a vacuum and eats all the cookies. One of the cookies rolls over by SpongeBob's side. He whistles for a brief second, then checks his wristwatch]
SpongeBob: It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do. [Grandma takes the cookie away]
Grandma: Oh, you don't want this baby food. How about a big piece of steamed coral? [gives him the coral]
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, uh... great. [takes a couple bites of it] Nutritious.
Grandma: Storytime! [Patrick runs to Grandma]
Patrick: Oh, boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!
SpongeBob: Storytime? [Patrick is sitting on Grandma's lap, ready to hear a story]
Grandma: You'll enjoy this, Patrick. It's a wonderful story about a magical sea leprechaun. [SpongeBob walks in] Oh, SpongeBob, you wouldn't be interested in this baby book. [drops a giant book on the floor] Here's the technical manual on routine active maintenance.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh... great. Yeah. [opens the book] Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it. [while eating a cookie, Patrick bites his finger leaving a big red bruise]
Patrick: [acting like a 2-year old] D'oh! My wittle finger! [sobs]
Grandma: Hold still, hold still. [kisses his finger] All better?
Patrick: [talking normally] Sorta.... [holds up his other finger] this finger hurts a little bit too. [SpongeBob is angry at what he sees then covers himself with the book he was reading]
Grandma: How about I give you a present? [SpongeBob then uncovers himself and sees Patrick with the present]
Patrick: Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies! [opens up the box, then the box cover lands on SpongeBob's head to find a sweater, but puts it on his head] ALRIGHT! Another hat!
Grandma: No, Patrick, it's a sweater.
SpongeBob: [Removes the box cover from his head] Huh?
Grandma: With love in every stitch.
SpongeBob: No... [imagines himself in the sweater instead of Patrick. The sweater tears in half] Don't I get a present, Grandma?
Grandma: Oh, I almost forgot. [hands him some office supplies] Here's some office supplies. I didn't wrap them. I knew you wouldn't mind. [cuckoo clock strikes three again] Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work. Bye-bye, SpongeBob.
[Patrick gets the sweater on] I'll bet you'd fancy a nap, huh, Patrick? [Patrick yawns] You still here, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work.
Grandma: [puts a blanket over Patrick as he lays on the couch] No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do.
SpongeBob: Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later.
Grandma: Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yep, that is it. Here I go.
Grandma: Come again if you get the chance. [SpongeBob opens the door]
SpongeBob: Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater.
Grandma: Toodleloo.
SpongeBob: I don't know when I'll be back.
Grandma: I know how busy you are.
SpongeBob: So, uh... that's it. [Patrick is sleeping]
Grandma: Shh, he's asleep. [SpongeBob slowly closes the door]
SpongeBob: Soooo loooong... [closes the door but then opens it with sad eyes. His sideburns fall off of his head. He starts throwing a big tantrum] I DON'T WANNA GROW UP! [holds up a giant chocolate chip cookie and snaps it in half in front of his face] I want cookies! [holds up a giant baby bottle with milk inside] and "milkie"! [wears a sweater] I want a sweater with love in the stitches! [runs around wearing a diaper with a blue pin on it as he's putting powder in the diaper] I wanna wear "diadies"! [rides in a wagon] I wanna ride in my wagon! [holds his giant teddy bear] I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins! [rides his old rocking horse with a sailor hat on and a lollipop] I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey! [holds up his bruised finger] And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo! [wailing and falls the floor, slamming his fists on the floor. He then rolls like a wheel. Grandma is shocked and sad for him. SpongeBob, sitting, sprays his tears in his mouth. Grandma thinks for a second. SpongeBob continues sobbing hysterically as he ratchets like a lawn sprinkler, almost spinning around and sprays tears everywhere. He spins even faster and floods the whole house]
Grandma: Take it easy, SpongeBob. [picks up the still-crying SpongeBob] SpongeBob. SpongeBob! [SpongeBob continues sobbing. Grandma holds his lips, stopping SpongeBob's crying] You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love.
SpongeBob: [sniffles as he starts to feel a bit better] I don't?
Grandma: Of course not. [pulls the plug under the tears to drain it] No matter how grown-up you get, you'll always be my little baby boo. [Grandma tickles SpongeBob, then kisses his forehead] And remember, you can kiss your grandma and still be an adult. [hands SpongeBob his sideburns and a chocolate chip cookie] Here you go. [SpongeBob puts on his sideburns and eats the cookie]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Grandma. [bites the cookie] Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?
Grandma: No problem. [she hugs SpongeBob. Outside, Squidward and everyone else are laughing]


Sandy: [Sandy rakes a pile of leaves in the shape of Texas] There we go! SpongeBob, I got all the leaves ra... [steps on piles of leaves still on the ground] SpongeBob, what are all these leaves doing here? You said you were going to rake them!
SpongeBob: [peeks his head out of a pile of leaves he is in] I am raking the leaves.
Sandy: But they're still all over the ground!
SpongeBob: Sandy, I can't rake any faster. [picks up a leaf and starts scraping it with a tiny rake] These are big leaves. [leaf breaks into more pieces] And they keep breaking into more leaves.
Sandy: [Sandy pushes him away and rakes them herself] Then go scrape the salt lick or somethin'! We got to get this stuff done before it's too late!
SpongeBob: What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?
Sandy: [hanging laundry] I told ya, SpongeBob... [scrubs the birdbath with a toothbrush] I'm hibernating next week.
SpongeBob: Hibernating? What's that?
Sandy: [painting the fence] It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter.
SpongeBob: Can I do that?
Sandy: [chuckles] No, silly. It's a mammalian thing. [paints over SpongeBob's helmet]
SpongeBob: Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.
Sandy: [cleaning her exercise wheel] Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!
SpongeBob: Why, Sandy? When does your... "carburation" begin? [Sandy jumps down, pulling down a giant calendar with a giant x on the 8th]
Sandy: In one week!
SpongeBob: But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3... [gasps] 168 more hours of playtime!
Sandy: You're telling me. And there's still so much stuff to do! We gotta climb some things!
SpongeBob: Climb!
Sandy: We gotta jump off of stuff!
SpongeBob: Jump!
Sandy: We gotta ride!
SpongeBob: Ride!
Sandy: I don't wanna go to sleep yet!
SpongeBob: Wait, Sandy! [Sandy begins to cry]
Sandy: I can't burn carbs in my sleep!
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: What?!
SpongeBob: Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you. [Pantera playing]
Sandy: Well, I'm glad, SpongeBob, 'cause for the next seven days, it's gonna be you, me, and these sweatbands! [holds them up. Cut to the giant sand mountains area. Sandy is riding a giant clam shell smashing through a sign] Yee-ha! [sliding down the mountain so fast she is now on fire. She rides past a fish with a backpack on his back. When she goes past him, he drops to the ground and rolls around cause he is on fire. She then rides past a man and a woman. The woman now wears a jogging outfit and the man is now riding a tricycle and holding a lollipop and paddleball. The woman looks at him]
Unnamed Fish #1: Uh... I can explain. [Sandy flips in mid-air, still on fire]
Sandy: I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage! Woo-hoo! [SpongeBob is wearing his green karate head gear and riding down the mountain on his tongue. Cut to two kids, building a sandman]
Girl: Maybe, if we sing that song, he'll come to life.
Billy: Ready?
Both: [singing] Oh, there once was a sandman... [SpongeBob rides into the sandman. a musical note pops up]
SpongeBob: Life's as extreme as you want to make it! [jumps off the mountain] Whoo!
Girl: Maybe we didn't sing it right. [SpongeBob is flying toward the ground. When he hits it, two bones are sticking out]
SpongeBob: Yeahhh... [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob standing outside Sandy's treedome] Whew, what a workout. [pulls out his right arm and shows its damages] I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow. [his arm falls to the ground] Ow.
Sandy: I got to say, I'm impressed with you, SpongeBob. You're making this the best prehibernation week ever.
SpongeBob: Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again. [sighs as he lifts up his left leg and moves it alternately with the other over to his house. Later, it's nighttime and he is finally crawling into bed] Good night, Gary. [falls asleep. Then Sandy pushes a button which launches SpongeBob out of his bed and into a lake. SpongeBob is now a block of ice. Sandy jumps in and becomes a block of ice]
Sandy: Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [shivering] W-what h-happened to s-sleeping? [Sandy pulls down a calendar]
Sandy: I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun. [swims away] Well, hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour! [cut to SpongeBob lifting a bowling ball into a tube. Sandy blows her whistle giving the signal and SpongeBob runs to the end and picks up a few jacks before the bowling ball hits him on his head. Sandy does the same thing but the bowling ball cracks her helmet] Isn't this GREAT?!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I've never played extreme jacks before! [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob with giant q-tips]
Sandy: Okay, SpongeBob, this one's going to be fun! We just whack each other with these giant ear cleaners 'til one of us falls off! [lifts hers up] On your mark... get set...
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?
Sandy: Go! [hits SpongeBob off the Sea Needle. SpongeBob lands on a fire hydrant. Sandy rides up on a two-seated bike] Come on, SpongeBob, we're goin' for a tandem ride through the park!
SpongeBob: Gee, that sounds safe!...I mean, fun. [gets up but leaves a piece of himself on the fire hydrant. He jumps on the bike] Okay, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy?
Sandy: I did, SpongeBob: the industrial park! [they ride into a giant factory] This is where the real action is! [Sandy pedals on barbed wire] This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on! [they ride through a conveyor belt with a giant crunching mouth at the end] I hope we make it! [bike begins to fall to the ground fast. SpongeBob screams] I'm havin' fun, too! [as they hit the ground, SpongeBob melts into a puddle. Sandy tosses a fishing rod on him] Wake up, slowpoke! [scene scrolls over to show a plane] We're going fly-fishin'! [rimshot]
SpongeBob: [thinking] This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle! [sees his shoe floating] Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something.
Sandy: What is it?
SpongeBob: Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of... [his mouth melts away from his eyes. He pulls it back up] I just feel like maybe I need to... [his mouth melts away again. Sandy puts her hand over his mouth]
Sandy: Hold that thought, SpongeBob! 'Cause it's time for a down-home favorite! [holds up a piece of hay. Pantera plays again] Find the hay in the needle stack! [throws it in a giant pile of needles]
SpongeBob: [bites his fingers in fear. Cut to inside the needle pile] Ow-ow, ow-ow-ow! [he gets pricked by the needles. One needle pricks his nose, causing it to deflate like a balloon. Deep voice] ...OUCH.
Sandy: Did you find it?
SpongeBob: Not yet.
Sandy: Well I'm going to look over here!
SpongeBob: You do that. [SpongeBob digs a hole underground then emerges]
Sandy: Found it, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs away] Come on! Best two out of three.
SpongeBob: Gotta hide! Uh-G-Gotta hide! [looks at his house] Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret. [looks at Patrick's rock] Under a rock? It's so original! [as he jumps for the rock, his pants get stuck on a small coral bush]
Sandy: SpongeBob?! [SpongeBob struggles to get free and eventually does, but leaves his pants stuck on the plant] SpongeBob? [Sandy walks up to SpongeBob's pants] Where are you, little square dude? [gasps] SpongeBob's tie! And all his other little dressin's! But-but he always folds his clothes before running around IN THE NUUUDE! Something terrible must have happened to him! [crunching and munching] Alright, listen up, y'all! I'm rounding up a search party! SpongeBob's gone missing! [Squidward smiles at Mr. Krabs, thinking that Mr. Krabs will not look for SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs gives Squidward an angry look.]
Mr. Krabs: [Squidward frowns because they will search for SpongeBob] Man the lifeboats!
Sandy: Alpha Team, you search uptown, Gold Team searches downtown. Any questions?
Frank: Gold Team rules!
Sandy: Now get movin'! [crowd yelling. Fred put a Lost poster with a picture of SpongeBob] SpongeBob? [Cuts to Sandy and the search party] Someone look up there! [Sandy pops out of a sewer] Put your doors, and friends into it! [cut to searching in the sulfur fields] Come on! He could be anywhere in these sulfur fields! [Clay looks in a spout]
Clay: Hey, SpongeBo-ob! [a blast of sulfur hits him in the face] …Well, at least I still have my personality.
Sandy: Check in this here moist cave! [Old Man Jenkins, Nathaniel and Scooter walk in shouting for SpongeBob then run out, realizing the cave is actually a three-eyed sea elephant]
Sandy: Status report!
Small Fish: [covered in Poison Sea Urchins] He's not at the Poison Sea Urchin cove...
Sandy: Well, look again!
Vera: [covered in leeches] He's not at the leech farm!
Sandy: Well, look again!
Squidward: He's not in my thoughts.
Sandy: Well, THINK AGAIN! [cut to Sandy talking into a megaphone] Attention, Bikini Bottom, the time has come to double, no, triple our efforts!
Squidward: How about a break? We've been at it for days!
Gale: Think about the children!
Sandy: That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach.
Frank: [whispering to Sadie] This is a load of barnacles...
Sandy: I heard that! No one's going anywhere until we find SpongeBob!!
Frank: Uh... uh, wait! [picks up Francis] Uh, here he is!
Sandy: That ain't SpongeBob! SpongeBob is square!
[Frank shapes Francis into a square]
Francis:  [in a poor imitation of SpongeBob] "I'm ready, I'm ready"?
Sandy: No you ain't! [Clay holds up a box of Kelp-O]
Clay: I found SquareBob!
Sandy: That's just a cereal box. Besides, he's yellow.
Charlie: [holds up a banana] Uh... here he is! Hey, can I go home now? [Sandy becomes annoyed]
Tina: [points up] Oh, look! He's up in the sky! [Sandy happily looks up, but SpongeBob's not in the sky]
Sandy: He's not...huh? [everyone is gone] They must have gone to search some more. [Sandy continues searching for SpongeBob] SpongeBob, where are you?! [lifts up a house] You under there?! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house where the unnamed fish from before is at]
Unnamed Fish #1: Uhh, I can explain.
Sandy: [lifts up another house] SpongeBob?! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house] Nope! SPONGEBOB!!!! WHERE ARE YOU!?!?!?!
Unnamed Fish #9: [everyone is looking at Sandy] That squirrel's gone crazy.
Woman: But she'll never look under a rock.
SpongeBob: Ahahaha, you said it! Sandy'll never find us! [everyone glares at SpongeBob and throws him out] Hey, wait, you don't understand!
Squidward: [pops out from under the rock] "Oh, look! It is I, SpongeBob, out here in the open!" [Sandy turns around]
Sandy: SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: [in horror] AAAAAHHH! C'MON, LET ME BACK IN! You don't understand! [Sandy hugs SpongeBob]
Sandy: Oh, SpongeBob, I was so worried! I thought something terrible happened! [grabs his arm] Come on! There's just enough time to go atom smashing! [Sandy runs but SpongeBob is not moving]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait!
Sandy: There's no time to wait!! HIBERNATION!! [pulls on SpongeBob's arm]
SpongeBob: Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important! [Sandy lets go of SpongeBob's arm] I...am a man! [holds up a razor] Okay, Sandy, I...I...I-I-I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU ANYMORE! I JUST CAN'T TAKE THE GAMES!! THEY'RE TEARING ME APART!!! [rips off his nose and throws it on the ground, then holds onto Sandy's legs crying] There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I...
[He notices Sandy has fallen asleep]
SpongeBob: Sandy? [chuckles a little] I never thought I'd say it, but thank Neptune for hibernation! [laughs and falls asleep]
Patrick: [returning home with groceries and an ice cream] WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?!?!


[A shot of the exterior of the Krusty Krab is shown.]
TV Announcer: And now, back to Crustacean Crime Theater.
[The scene changes to show a black and white TV. On it, there is a sleeping crab. Another crab comes in and laughs evilly. He grabs the other crab's shell, and the sleeping crab wakes up. The crab, possibly the Sneaky Hermit, runs away with the shell, laughing evilly.]
Shellnapping Victim: Stop! Thief!
[Two police officers show up.]
Cop #1: Which way did he go?
Shellnapping Victim: [pointing to the direction the thief ran] He went that way!
Cop #2: Let's get 'em, boys!
[four police officers run after the Sneaky Hermit, off-screen. They run back into frame with the Sneaky Hermit tied up. The scene cuts to the Sneaky Hermit wearing prison stripes.]
Thief: [As bars come down and the scene pans out to show the TV inside of the Krusty Krab, at a table.] Curses! Foiled again!
[The scene shows Mr. Krabs at a table watching a small TV. Patrick and SpongeBob are behind him.]
Mr. Krabs: What a no-good eel-in-the-kelp that guy was! [Stands on barrel.] There ain't nothing worse than a thief! Thieves need to be locked up forever! They should all be strung up by their gills and forced to breathe air!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, what about all the stuff you stole?
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
SpongeBob:  [points to the barrel Mr. Krabs is standing on] Like that barrel. [The scene then shows a close up of the barrel.] It says, "Property of Salty Sea Farms".
[Mr. Krabs jumps off the barrel.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's where I rent me pickles from.
SpongeBob: Are you renting the barrel, too?
Mr. Krabs: Well, no.
SpongeBob: Then you bought it?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: Then, isn't that stealing?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I, uh...
Patrick: [While holding up a towel.] What about this towel from the Sizzling Spring Sauna?
Mr. Krabs: Um... Well..
SpongeBob: [While waving a phone back and forth] And this Bikini Bell phone.
Mr. Krabs: Well, uh, it's
Patrick: [While holding up hedge clippers] And Sandy's hedge clippers.
[Mr. Krabs is now starting to sweat]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, they're...
SpongeBob: ...And Plankton's lawn mower. [Extreme close-up of SpongeBob's hand. It has a small lawnmower in it.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, he...
SpongeBob: [While holding up hair curlers] Even Mrs. Puff's hair curlers.
Mr. Krabs: [While grabbing the hair curlers] That one was a gift! [He stops sweating.] Listen, all that stuff is, uh... borrowed.
SpongeBob: Borrowed? Well, that's a relief. I thought you took it without [While shaking his head] permission.
Mr. Krabs: [While waving his claw down] Ah, permission shmermission! You can borrow anything you want, anytime, as long as if you give it back [puts arms to side] before it's missed. [While shrugging] Everyone knows that! Right?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [raise fists in air] Okay!
Mr. Krabs: All right then! [While hugging them] Hugs? [Mr. Krabs walks behind SpongeBob and Patrick.] You put in [While pushing the two out of the frame.] a hard day's work, boys!
[The scene changes to show a wide shot of the exterior of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out the door.]
Patrick: But I don't work here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run out of frame.]
Mr. Krabs: See you later! Oh, that was a close one.
[Later at the park]
SpongeBob: What do you want to do today?
[The scene shows a medium tracking shot of Patrick and SpongeBob. SpongeBob is hunched over and is dragging his arms. Patrick is moving the top of his torso and head in the z-direction.]
Patrick: I don't know. What do you want to do today?
SpongeBob: I don't know. What do you want to do today?
Patrick: I don't know. What do you want to do today?
SpongeBob: I don't know. What do you want to do today?
[The two stop moving. Patrick gasps and the scene pans out to show Lou with a balloon stand. The scene shows a close-up of Patrick's head.]
Patrick: I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY. [The scene shows a close-up of the balloons. They sparkle.] I need some money. [Patrick looks in left pocket] Uh. [He looks in his right pocket.] Oh. [He looks in his belly button. The scene shows an extreme close up of his belly button. It shows that there is some lint, a paper clip, and a ticket.] Oh...

Patrick: No, wait! [The scene shows a close-up shot of Patrick's face.] Instead of borrowing the money, why don't we just borrow the balloon?!
[The scene shows a medium close-up shot of SpongeBob]

SpongeBob: What?

Patrick: LIAR, LIAR, PLANTS FOR HIRE!
SpongeBob: ...it's "pants on fire", Patrick.
Patrick: Well, you would know... liar.
SpongeBob: Well, if you're going to be that way... I'll eat it myself!
[The scene returns to the medium close-up of Patrick.]

Patrick: Oh, that's it. [Patrick stomps his foot down on the firewood. The fire lights up again. Patrick howls in pain, hopping around holding his foot.] First the balloon, now my candy bar. You're out of control. I'm... [menacingly] I'm telling on you!

[The scene changes to show a wide shot of Cell 1B.] [As SpongeBob and Patrick walk into the cell] If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.

[pans over live-action houses]
Narrator: And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate. [The exterior of Patchy's house is shown. The name "Patchy" appears. Inside, Patchy is wrapping presents]
Patchy:  [to the tune of "Jingle Bells"] Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho ho. [he notices he's on air] Oh! Hi. [he waves] I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club! [He notices a long piece of confetti on his hook and tries to shake it off. He pulls on it and whacks himself in the eye, giving him a black eye. He switches his patch over to the other eye] Hey, that's better! [Potty, a puppet bird on strings, flies in]
Potty: [squawks] Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Patchy: That's right, Potty! It is Christmas. [he limps over to the fireplace] And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year. [he blows on his pipe, and bubbles emerge] Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now! [He picks up a picture of SpongeBob. Cuts to SpongeBob, holding a remote]
SpongeBob: I sure am! [He presses a button on the remote. A large chimney rises from the ground next to his house, and a gigantic funnel pops out of it with the words "Welcome Santa" in neon letters] I'm ready! [Patchy laughs]
Patchy: Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae. [he puts down SpongeBob's picture] And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating. [He picks up a picture of Patrick. Cuts to Patrick standing by his house with a dopey smile on his face. Zooms out to reveal a single ornament hanging from the antenna on top of his rock. It snaps off and hits the ground. Patrick then falls to the ground as well. Now, Patchy is mixing cookie dough] I too am also preparing for Christmas. [he lifts up the mixer] Hmm, unbaked cookie dough! [he takes a lick] Mmm...
Potty: [squawks] Potty want cookie dough! [Potty flies over, squawking] Cookie! [Patchy ducks]
Patchy: Potty! No! [Potty flies back and forth]
Potty: Cookie! [squawks]
Patchy: Get out of here!
Potty: Cookie!
Patchy: Potty!
Potty: [squawks] Give us a lick!
Patchy: Back off, you flying freak! [Potty flies on the counter]
Potty: [squawks] Clarify please.
Patchy: [the cookies are shaped like SpongeBob and Patrick] This here cookie dough is for the children, not for pesky parrots. [Cuts to Hans reaching over and ringing a bell. Patchy looks out the window] What's that? Three bells! Well, we all know what three bells means!
Children: [off-screen] Free ice cream! [Patchy laughs]
Patchy: No, you silly livers. [sternly] No!
Potty: [squawks] Man overboard? [Patchy walks over to a desk]
Patchy: You, I'm ignoring. [he sits down] No, it's time to open fan letters! [Potty flies over with a letter in her beak]
Potty: [squawks] Here you go! [Patchy tugs at it]
Patchy: Thank you, Potty. [Potty is not letting go] Yeah. Okay Potty, thank you! [Potty squawks, still not letting go] Come on, give it, you birdbrain! [Potty squawks some more] Quiet, infernal bird! [He uses his hook, now with a pair of scissors on the end, to snip Potty's strings. Potty squawks and falls to the ground. Patchy nods] Hmm. [he sits back down] This letter comes to us from...
Fish Head: [as voiceover] Name and address withheld! [Patchy tears the envelope open, pieces of it flying all over. He pulls up his eye patch and replaces it with a pair of reading glasses with one eye covered up]
Patchy: And he writes, "Dear SpongeBob, I am ten years old, and I was wondering if you like Christmas as much as I do. Sincerely yours..."
Fish Head: [as voiceover] Name and address withheld! [Patchy gets up and takes off his glasses. Now his eye patch is back on]
Patchy: A very good question. But you know they didn't always celebrate Christmas in Bikini Bottom.
Potty: [squawks] They didn't?
Patchy: No sir, my fine feathered little neck pain. [He pulls down Potty's strings. Potty falls to the ground, and a puppeteer falls down from above the set. Patchy hangs a homemade SpongeBob ornament on a Christmas tree. Zooms out, showing the entire tree, which is decorated with many similar SpongeBob, as well as ornaments featuring Patrick and Squidward, and a few gift boxes] There was a time when no one had even heard of Christmas in Bikini Bottom. [he snaps his fingers] Hey! Who wants to hear the story of SpongeBob's very first Christmas? [Cuts to Potty, who looks very drowsy and with bloodshot eyes. Patchy turns around] Potty? [Patchy sees an empty bowl of cookie dough, accompanied by a foghorn noise] You ate all me cookie dough! [Potty is now incredibly fat. Potty's body and strings fall off, leaving only the bird's head]
Potty: Squ-ouch! [Patchy shrugs]
Patchy: Oh, well. On with the show.
[After the title card and opening credits, SpongeBob is shown waiting on a hill near Sandy's treedome, wearing karate gloves]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move. [practices karate and sneaks over to Sandy's door as Sandy hums "Jingle Bells"]
SpongeBob: What diabolical act is she committing now? [Sandy plugs in Christmas lights outside her tree and SpongeBob freaks out] Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire! [rushes inside and instead of throwing water on tree, he throws it on Sandy] Huh? So I guess there's no fire?
Sandy: What in the name of the Alamo is wrong with you, SpongeBob? Ain't you never seen a Christmas tree before?
SpongeBob: Christmas who?
Sandy: What?! Y'all never heard of Christmas?
SpongeBob: Is she a friend from Texas?
Sandy: [laughs] No. I can't believe you haven't heard of... [makes an adorable face] ...Christmas.
SpongeBob: Tell me more about this... [imitates Sandy] ..."Christmas."
Patchy: And so, Sandy wove the magical tale of gumdrops and pennywhistles. She told of toy-making elves and flying reindeer. But best of all, she told of the one they call, Santa Claus. [SpongeBob's eyes widen]
[The next day at The Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [standing on a table towards Squidward, Patrick and Mr. Krabs] And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.
Squidward: Yawn.
SpongeBob: But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you.
Patrick: Just like a genie. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine.
SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs. [grabs a piece of paper and pencil] Here you go! You can get started on your letter.
Squidward: I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts.
Patrick: Like a genie.
Mr. Krabs: Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus.
Squidward: Oh, brother.
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Okay, who's next?
Patrick: Ooh, ooh, me, me!
Squidward: Ooh.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Patrick.
Patrick: There's no words on this paper.
SpongeBob: Not yet.
Patrick: [grabs a pencil] Yippee! A writing stick.
SpongeBob: C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter.
Squidward: SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter. [Patrick's letter tears in half]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?
SpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid... [Patrick rips his again] ...ward.
Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob... [hands him another piece] Thanks. [sits down and starts writing with the paper on top of the pencil] Dear Sant... [paper rips] D'oh! Not again.
SpongeBob: Here, Patrick, watch me. [starts to write] Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish. [puts the letter in a bottle] Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!
[presses it and the bottle shoots up to the surface]
Patrick: Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?
SpongeBob: Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve.
Mr. Krabs: Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go.
SpongeBob: Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?
Mr. Krabs: A pony.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: With saddle bags full of money! [shoots a bottle up to the surface]
Patrick: Here you go, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What did you wish for, Patrick?
Patrick: Another piece of paper. [bottle shoots up to the surface]
SpongeBob: And what did you wish for, little girl?
Susie: Front teeth!
Cowboy: I could use a new hat!
Jennifer-Millie: I need a new hairstyle!
Lonnie: I'd like a glass of water for my teeth.
[lots of bottles get shot up to the surface]
Squidward: Excuse me, coming through, out of the way.
SpongeBob: Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?
Squidward: My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.
SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival.
Everyone: Hooray!

Squidward: [pokes head out of his window] Santa Claus is a big phony! SpongeBob has got you all fooled!
SpongeBob: C'mon, Squidward. C'mon! [closes window and gets in bed]
Squidward: Those idiots are gonna be up all night while I get a full night’s sleep. [tries to sleep, but the singing outside wakes him up]
Citizens: ♪Oh, Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight. Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.♪
SpongeBob: C'mon everybody! Let's sing till Santa gets here.
Citizens: ♪Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight. Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming...♪
[it is then morning and they are tired]
Citizens: ♪Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.♪
Fred: Hey! Where's Santa?
SpongeBob: Uh, he should be here any minute. ♪Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.♪
Citizens: Oh, c'mon. Enough of this. [everyone argues and start to leave]
Fred: Thanks for the lies, Mr. Fairytale! Let's go waste our time somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Hey, guys, where's your Christmas spirit? He's just running late.
Patrick: He probably just stopped for a snack! Fat guys get hungry right?
SpongeBob: Yeah! [they wait and wait and then one of the jellyfish jars breaks on SpongeBob's head as the jellyfish floats away]
Patrick: Never trust a genie. [Patrick and a snowman walk away]
Squidward: [alarm goes off] Ah, morning already? Oh, boy! [speaking in a megaphone] Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Wait. Oh, I see a great Christmas photo op. Could you move in a little? [SpongeBob does so] Say Santa Claus.
SpongeBob: [very sad face] Santa Claus. [Squidward takes the picture]
Squidward: Aww, our first Christmas. ♪This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas. The first Christmas is this Christmas. [donkey appears on screen making noises] 'Cause it feels like the first Christmas to me.♪ [laughs at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: You were right, Squidward. This was a stupid holiday. [cries; takes out a present] I still want you to have this.
Squidward: What? What's this?
SpongeBob: A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... Santa came! [cries some more]
Squidward: Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I...
SpongeBob: You're welcome. [sadly walks off and cries]
Squidward: SpongeBob? He made me a present? It's probably a jellyfish net, or an old Krabby patty, or... [imitates a hillbilly] his favorite underpants. Haha. Present. [opens the present] Why, it looks like a clarinet. [smells it] It smells like one, too. Handcrafted out of driftwood. And it's even got my name on it. [finds a button that says "push"] What's this? [pushes the button and three wooden Squidwards with clarinets come out and bob up and down] Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. [sniffles] Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a... [donkey appears on screen and makes noises] big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob?  [SpongeBob is on a ladder trying to get his lights down]
SpongeBob: I guess I won't be needing this. [slides down with the lights in hand] That's better. [a gray cloud comes and rains on SpongeBob]
Squidward: The poor little guy. All he wanted was to spread a little joy.
SpongeBob: I'd better get this stuff off of Squid's place.
Squidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
SpongeBob: Huh? Hello? Who's there? Huh? Hello?
Squidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
SpongeBob: Hello? Yes. Who's there? Huh? Hello? Show yourself. Yoo-hoo. Hello? Who is it? Huh?
Squidward: Up here, you dunce. [dressed like Santa Claus] I mean, uh... Merry Christmas, little boy!
SpongeBob: [gasps] C-c-could it be?
Squidward: Yes, it is I, Santa Claus. Ho, ho, ho... [slips off the roof and hits the ground]
SpongeBob: Hey, you're S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... [takes a deep breath] S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... [takes a deep breath] S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...
Squidward: Hey, uh, kid, take it easy.
SpongeBob: S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... ta... [faints]
Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... [Squidward covers his mouth]
Squidward: Don't do that again.
SpongeBob: I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly?
Squidward: Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body.
SpongeBob: Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?
Squidward: Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny.
SpongeBob: And what about that nose? [pokes his nose and laughs] I knew you were supposed to have a big one, but that thing's gigantic. [laughs]
Squidward: Alright! I'm Santa.
SpongeBob: [jumps onto Squidward] Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.
Squidward: I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did.
SpongeBob: I did? [faints and falls on Gary's shell]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over.
Shelly: Do you have a present for me, Santa?
Squidward: Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really...
SpongeBob: [laughs] Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down.
Squidward: Uhh, right, just a second. [searches in his house for something] C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A book of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect! [hands the little girl a wrench] There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!
Shelly: Thanks, Santa. [scratches the wrench like it's a puppy]
Squidward: That almost felt good. [Squidward then notices a long line of citizens waiting for presents] I didn't... who?
Fred: Hey, Santa, where's my present?
Old Man Jenkins: And mine!
Abigail-Marge: And what about me?
Squidward: Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people. [searches for stuff in his house] Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you.
Jennifer-Millie: Thank you, Santa. This is just what I wanted. [puts bowl on her head] A new hairstyle.
[Squidward gives the little girl two forks]
Little Girl: Thanks, Santa. [She puts them on like front teeth]
Squidward: [gives Patrick a clock] Here you go, Patrick.
Patrick: Wow. [punches a hole through the clock] A wrist watch.
Fish: Thank you, Santa!
Squidward: [gives everything else in his house to the citizens] What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane? [SpongeBob knocks on the door] You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.
SpongeBob: Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind. [turns SpongeBob towards the door and pushes him so he walks] And Santa is... oh, his belly was small, but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward...
Squidward: Well, at least it's over. [notices a bottle with a letter in it on the ground] Huh? What's this?
Santa: Dear Squidward, thanks for all your help! You've been a real good boy this year. Warm regards, Santa Claus. [letter disappears into thin air] Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! [in his sleigh flying] Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho. [does a crazy dance while saying his "ho ho ho"]
Squidward: [Shocked to see Santa does exist and nonchalantly] Yup, I'm insane. [plays his wooden clarinet in the ending tone of the episode]
Santa: Merry Christmas! [back at Patchy's house, a sailboat with a homemade Sponge and Pat moves in front of a picture of the island, which has a bunch of presents on it]
Patchy: Dee dee, dee dee dee dee.
SpongeBob: [as a puppet] Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island!
Patrick: [also a puppet] Presents, ahoy.
SpongeBob: Hooray! [Patchy starts making storm sound effects] Oh, a storm!
Patrick: Yay! I mean yikes!
Patchy: [makes more sound effects and begins speaking in his own voice] Oh, we're going down! [He keeps making noises. Zoom out to show the boat is on Patchy's head] Trim the sails! Hoist the yardarms! Turn on the Weather Channel! [he screams]
Man on Set: [off-screen] Patchy?
Patchy: Oh, hi kids. Boy, that SpongeBob makes me as jolly as a roger. Well, I hope you enjoyed SpongeBob's Christmas tale. And I hope your Christmas is better than sunken treasure. [He takes the boat off his head. Potty flies out, and there is a nest underneath her. In it are a few eggs she laid, wrapped in bows. Patchy picks one up] Aw... Potty left me a little Christmas present. [He laughs. Then he goes over to the mistletoe] Argh, ye old mistletoe. And you know what that means. [he sprays breath freshener in his mouth] Ah, time for somebody to kiss Patchy the Pirate! [he makes kissing noises] Come on, who's it gonna be? Come on! Kiss the captain! [He laughs. Potty flies over and squawks. Patchy screams]
Potty: Give us a kiss! [Patchy goes to avoid him]
Patchy: No! No, not you! [Potty keeps flying around squawking] No, not you Potty! Get out of here! No, Potty! I don't wanna kiss you! No, we talked about this. Potty! No!
Potty: Kissy, kissy!
Narrator: Well, it looks like Patchy's pretty busy at the moment, so I'll say it for him. Good night, and happy holidays.
[the words "Happy Holidays" are spelled out on screen]


[SpongeBob and Patrick are running down the block jumping up and down, disfiguring themselves in the process]
SpongeBob: [hyperactive, in time with Patrick] Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house! Yeah! Ha-ha! Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house! Ha-ha-ha...
Patrick: [hyperactive, in time with SpongeBob] Yay! Yay! Ha-ha! I'm gonna beat you there! I'm gonna... ah, it's gonna be fun! Ah-ha...
[They freeze in mid-run when they see Sandy's treedome is enclosed with metal walls. The two walk up to the door, which has a "Keep Out" sign on it]
SpongeBob: Sandy? [they enter] Hey, Sandy, what's with the sign?
[the two walk up to a TV which shows Sandy in a pink nightgown eating acorns]
Patrick: Look, she's on the eating channel.
Sandy: [On TV. Sandy fills her cheeks with acorns and swallows, wincing in pain as the giant mass of acorns passes down her long, thin neck and into her small torso, deforming it as it goes] Howdy, [eats more nuts] if y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called HIBERNATION. ["HIBERNATION" appears on the bottom of the screen. Sandy eats more nuts] During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So, do not disturb! [sternly] ...That means you, SpongeBob.
[Patrick turns the TV off and puts on SpongeBob's water helmet and his own]
Patrick: We better put these on.
SpongeBob: Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray.
[Patrick pushes the button, letting all the water drain out of the front foyer]
Patrick: When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? "No" means "yes"!
SpongeBob: Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?
Patrick: SpongeBob! Look at this! [snow falls in and covers the bottom of the treedome. SpongeBob gasps and walks in]
SpongeBob: What is this stuff? [pan around the treedome]
Patrick: It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before!
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Wow, Patrick, that was beautiful!
Patrick: What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see? [he hands SpongeBob the wrapper. SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Put your helmet back on! [Patrick has taken his helmet off and is eating the snowflakes] You know there's no water in Sandy's house!
Patrick: It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look! [Patrick lets a flake land on his tongue and it melts into water]
SpongeBob: I guess you're right. It's okay here!
Patrick: Take it off, no one's lookin'. [SpongeBob does so and the two cheer and burrow themselves in the snow. They pop back up with noses made of snow. Then, they hear a weird sound] SpongeBob, did you hear that?
SpongeBob: I think it came from Sandy's tree.
Patrick: That is one tired tree.
SpongeBob: Let's check it out. [cut to inside Sandy's tree where SpongeBob and Patrick come in. They both gasp] Look what's in Sandy's bed! [they walk over to the bed, where Sandy is asleep in hibernation form, looking like some weird squirrel-like monster]
Patrick: Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!
SpongeBob: I think this thing is Sandy.
Patrick: Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep.
Sandy: [snoring, talking in sleep] I've had enough of your dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan. I'm gonna get you and your partner, Pinhead Larry or my name ain't Sheriff... Sandy... [snores]
SpongeBob: [giggles] She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws. [the two giggle] Look out, Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan.
Sandy: I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense.
SpongeBob: Oooh, you better run faster, Sandy!
Patrick: Yeah, I'm getting away! Faster! [Sandy moves her arms and legs]
SpongeBob: Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!
Patrick: Faster! faster! [the two giggle]
Sandy: I'll get you two. You're nothing but pure evil! Just like newspaper comics... [snores off to sleep, the two giggle again]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore.
Patrick: That's not disturbing, this is disturbing. [Patrick struggles to create a talking face that protrudes from his back] Hi there, SpongeBob, my name is PATBACK.
SpongeBob: Ha! That is really disturbing!
[the two laugh uncontrollably. Cut to Sandy, her eye shoots open. A giant shadow looms over SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick stops laughing while SpongeBob continues to laugh]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [stops laughing] Huh?
[Sandy is really mad now, she's steaming and roaring. SpongeBob and Patrick run, but Sandy has them both by the their pants and gives them an extreme wedgie. They run in mid-air anyway.]
Patrick: Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!
SpongeBob: [Crying from the pain of the wedgie.] Sandy! NO! STOP!
Sandy: I warned you, Dirty Dan. Now, you've just crossed the border into Hurtville.
SpongeBob: Sandy, it's us, your friends, SpongeBob and Patrick!
Patrick: Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!
Sandy: Gonna skin y'all and make a pair of size six...boots... [she falls asleep and drops the two. They inch away and see Sandy fall back into her bed]
Patrick: Fun's over.
SpongeBob: Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her.
Patrick: Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint. [he takes the lint out of its designated area. It somehow forms into the shape of earmuffs]
SpongeBob: All right, Pat! [he takes them and crawls over to the bed. SpongeBob puts the earmuffs on Sandy]
Sandy: I'm gonna rip your arms off and.... flapjacks? [snores]
SpongeBob: Well, that oughta work.
Patrick: [loudly] Hey, Sandy, does it work? [Sponge and Patrick look at each other and raise their eyebrows repeatedly and in symmetry]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!
Patrick: Hey, Sandy! Don't wake up! [the two giggle, SpongeBob holds a megaphone up to Sandy's head and yells into it]
SpongeBob: See ya later, Sheriff Sandy! [laughs, the two run down to the snowy plains and act like outlaws, with that drawling voice] You're under arrest!
Patrick: You'll never catch me! [he giggles and makes a snowball and throws it at SpongeBob's face. They both laugh. Patrick starts to make another one, but he's hit by a giant mound of snow. SpongeBob stands on a giant snow cannon, laughing] Hey, that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons.
SpongeBob: They couldn't afford station wagons either! [A giant snowball shaped like a station wagon lands on Patrick]
Patrick: Nice paneling.
SpongeBob: All right, Pinhead. Your time is up! [cut to Patrick, who looks like a cone-head]
Patrick: Hey, who you callin' Pinhead? I wanna be Dirty Dan!
SpongeBob: What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?
Patrick: I'm dirty. [he's hit on the head by a giant "snow" shovel that SpongeBob has]
SpongeBob: I'd say I'm Dirty Dan. [Patrick runs off and returns with a giant bat with a nail in it made of snow]
Patrick: I'd say I'm Dirty Dan! [whacks SpongeBob with it]
SpongeBob: Ow! [whacks Patrick again] I'd say I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! Oof!
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! D'oh!
[Inside the tree, Sandy blissfully sleeps until the repeated impacts cause the earmuffs to fall off.]
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! Ow! [Sandy's eyes snap open] [Cut back to outside]
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. [SpongeBob sees something behind Patrick]
SpongeBob: [in terror] AAAAAAAHHH!
Patrick: Screaming will get you nowh- [Sandy reaches out, grabs the top of Patrick's head and rips it off. Sandy huffs and growls as she stands behind Patrick, towering over him with sharpened teeth bared in a snarl]
Sandy: [breathing heavily] Which one of you fellers is the REAL Dirty Dan?
Patrick: Uh...I am? [bad idea, as Sandy promptly backhands him and sends him flying across the treedome]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick slams against the dome hard enough to leave a dent and little drumsticks float around his head]
Patrick: Hot wings! [cut back to Sandy, who rounds on a cowering and terrified SpongeBob]
Sandy: Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours! [SpongeBob's pupils shrink in fear, he screams and jumps away to avoid it seconds before Sandy's fist obliterates where he was just sitting. Sandy throws her head back and bellows] PINHEEEEAAAADDDD!!!! [SpongeBob whimpers and runs, Sandy is close behind. SpongeBob later doesn't seem to be going far because he's right behind Sandy on the exercise wheel. He slips and gets flung across the wheel. He flies off and slams into the picnic table, leaving a giant crater in its place. Sandy leans over the crater] Now you're gonna pay for those crimes, Pinhead! [SpongeBob picks up a wood board]
SpongeBob: Sandy, stand back. I'm warning ya! [Sandy roars right in SpongeBob's face] Okay, I warned ya! [SpongeBob throws the wooden board, Patrick pops up beside Sandy]
Patrick: Did you win? [he's hit by the board and rolls down the crater to SpongeBob’s feet] Hi, SpongeBob! [Sandy growls before leaping into the crater. SpongeBob and Patrick cling onto each other in fear for their lives as a huge shadow covers them before a cloud obscures them, presumably simulating a fight. Cut to the treedome at night where two gravestones are in front of Sandy's Treedome: one for Dirty Dan and one for Pinhead Larry. Patrick and SpongeBob come up from under the snow in respective tombstone order] Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just wanna be Patrick.
SpongeBob: Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again! [the two run to the door and SpongeBob tries to open it, but his hands slip off the wheel and accidentally hits Patrick in the face]
Patrick: Ouch! [covers his eyes in pain]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!
Patrick: Let me have a try. [he goes up to the door and spits on both hands, preparing to open the door] *Ptuh* *Ptuh* Open sesame! [nothing happens, Patrick shrugs] Well, I've done all I can do...
SpongeBob: Then we're stuck in here...until the door thaws...in spring.
Patrick: Barnacles. [cut to much later, where SpongeBob and Patrick are completely buried in the snow, shivering and blue] Is it spring yet?
SpongeBob: N-n-n-no. [Patrick and SpongeBob's snow covering on their faces breaks off]
Patrick: I'm so c-cold that I'm sh-shivering. [a piece of Patrick's side of his head cracks off, revealing his brain.]
SpongeBob: I'm so cold... [SpongeBob snaps off his two nose drippings and clicks them together] that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks.
Patrick: I'm so c-cold... that... I'm shivering.
SpongeBob: Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree! [SpongeBob begins to pull a strip of bark off the tree, but he is stopped by Sandy's booming voice]
Sandy: [off-screen] You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead! [SpongeBob quickly puts the strip back on and puts duct tape on it, whimpers. SpongeBob goes back to Patrick]
SpongeBob: The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?
Patrick: Maybe she just ignores it.
SpongeBob: Maybe...
Patrick: Maybe...
SpongeBob: Maybe it's her fur! [cut to a shot of a real-life squirrel]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah! [cut to inside the tree where SpongeBob and Patrick marvel at Sandy's fur]
SpongeBob: Look at all that warm, toasty fur.
Patrick: It's like a gold mine, but with fur. [SpongeBob slowly prepares to pluck a hair off Sandy]
SpongeBob: Carefully...carefully? [Patrick smacks him]
Patrick: Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!
SpongeBob: All right, all right, hang on a second! [he plucks one hair off and Sandy jumps up from her sleep and roars ferociously. Then goes back to sleep] That should be enough, right? [Patrick takes the hair]
Patrick: Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, big man!
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I've lived a full life! [he plucks one more hair, causing the same reaction with Sandy]
Patrick: This is taking too long! I want the warm now! [he takes a piece of duct tape, places it on Sandy]
SpongeBob: Pat, no! [Patrick rips a patch of Sandy's fur off with the tape, leaving a patch of bare skin. Sandy roars and goes back to sleep, SpongeBob sighs in relief] Pat, are you crazy?! [we see that Patrick has placed the fur on his forehead]
Patrick: No, I'm warm.
SpongeBob: Let me see that roll of tape.
[As we pan out from the tree, we hear the tape ripping out Sandy's fur and her roaring. Cut to later, Patrick comes out of the tree with a strip of hair on his forehead and his pants full of fur. SpongeBob comes out with big eyebrows and a goatee.]
Patrick: Man, that fur really hits the spot. No more frozen armpits! [he lifts his arm up, revealing fur under it]
SpongeBob: And this eyebrow-goatee-combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.
Patrick: You said it!
SpongeBob: I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!
SpongeBob and Patrick: BRING IT ON!!!
[Just then, all the snow stops and melts. It's springtime again, flowers bloom.]
SpongeBob: ...Spring?
Sandy: [off screen. yawns] Wow, spring already!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run frantically to the door, but the handle hasn't thawed yet]
SpongeBob: Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!
Sandy: [off-screen] I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!
[SpongeBob and Patrick frantically blow on the door handle until it melts. Sandy peeks out the window]
Sandy: Oh, look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!
[With that, SpongeBob and Patrick go crazy trying to open the door. Patrick screams. Sandy walks over, completely hairless and in her bikini.]
Sandy: Hey, guys! [They climb off the door]
[She sees all the different fur assortments the two are wearing. She looks down at her bald pink body and shrieks in horror.]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Sandy. [Patrick removes the furry piece from his forehead, smiling fearfully] Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals! [Sandy is really ticked now]
Sandy: [growling with fury] SpongeBob... Patrick...
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered.
[He giggles nervously. Cut to Sandy's arm pouring some lemonade, she giggles.]
Sandy: [giggles] More lemonade, boys? [pan out to see that Patrick is curled around Sandy's head and SpongeBob around Sandy's body with miserable looks on their faces, in order to cover up her bald pink hide and keep her warm until her fur grows back. The two take a glass]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Thanks, Sandy.
Sandy: Spring sure is lovely.


[It's another great day in Bikini Bottom. Gary is out in a clearing and SpongeBob tiptoes over to a rock behind him giggling. He looks from behind it]
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got ya now, Gary.
Gary: Meow? [SpongeBob jumps up and lands in mid-air. He touches Gary's shell with his index finger]
SpongeBob: Tag, you're it! [he runs off, SpongeBob jumps and he opens his mouth. He flies to his house and chomps down on the side of it, leaving him clinging. garbled] Gary will never find me here! [Gary crawls over the ground, up the house and toward SpongeBob] Uh-oh. [Gary's eye substitutes as an arm as he tags SpongeBob and meows] Tag! Now I'm it! [he laughs uncontrollably as he slides down the wall, scraping off two slices of the covering with his teeth. Patrick is below and SpongeBob takes the shavings out of his teeth]
Patrick: Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Gary and I are playing tag. You wanna join us?
Patrick: Oh boy, would I!
SpongeBob: [slyly] Okay, [touches him] Tag, you're it! [walks away]
Patrick: I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it! [Gary is still there, and he meows. Patrick tags him] Tag, you're it! I win, I win! [Gary purrs and rubs against Patrick. Then he crawls all around Patrick's body. SpongeBob walks over] What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat! [laughs]
SpongeBob: That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!
Patrick: [laughs] It tickles! [the two laugh endlessly as Gary continues to crawl around. They continue laughing and laughing until it's dark]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gare-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary. [he pulls Gary off of Patrick and walks away] Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay. [Patrick waves] What about you, Gary? [SpongeBob sees that he's no longer holding Gary] Gary? Gary? [cut to Patrick's house where the rock is up and Patrick's brushing his teeth and looking in a mirror on the side of the wall. He has his nightcap on]
Patrick: [singing] Brush brush brush, brush brush brush… [SpongeBob walks over]
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?
Patrick: [singing] Brush brush brush, [he brushes under his armpit] Brushin' everywhere… [he spits and turns around. We see Gary attached to his stomach] Nope. [looks down] Oh, hey, here he is! [Gary purrs and meows]
SpongeBob: Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep.
Patrick: Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?
SpongeBob: Hey, that's a great idea!
Patrick: A sleep-over! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games… [SpongeBob thinks to himself and we hear Patrick in the background saying, "Blah blah blah blah…"]
SpongeBob: Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover.
Patrick: And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books…
SpongeBob: OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow. [they wave good-bye and SpongeBob walks home]
Patrick: Blah blah blah blah blah… [soon, night becomes day and SpongeBob wakes up to his foghorn alarm clock]
SpongeBob: I'm awake!
Patrick: [off-screen] Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob leaps up and runs to the window. Patrick and Gary are outside]
SpongeBob: Hey, guys, how was the sleepover?
Patrick: Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows! [he pulls Gary off his chest and runs. Gary goes after him as he runs around SpongeBob's house. He runs on top of his house and falls off and continues running, which Gary then imitates] See? [SpongeBob jumps from the window and runs off]
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee! [laughs] Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me? [he notices he's not being chased] You're not chasing me… [Gary is still with Patrick]
Patrick: Come on, Gary, let's play a different game. [he and Gary walk away. SpongeBob jumps in front of Gary]
SpongeBob: Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of… [Gary crawls away after Patrick] …you… What's wrong with me? [he sniffs his armpit] Do I offend? [Patrick is playing with Gary, Gary is crawling on Patrick's toes. Patrick's on his back and laughing while Gary purrs. SpongeBob runs inside the house and brings out a ball covered in snail slime] Hey, Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball! [Gary is sitting on Patrick's bum and Patrick shakes it, laughing. SpongeBob drops the ball. Gary is now crawling up to Patrick's armpit. SpongeBob pulls a can of snail nip] Hey, Gary, look! Snail-nip! [he eats some] Huh? Huh-huh? [Gary is too busy crawling on Patrick's head to notice. SpongeBob decides to try something else, he runs inside and hangs from the window by his head] Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh, merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head! [Gary is on his shell rolling Patrick left and right] All right, that's it! [The window opens and SpongeBob falls. Gary is now rolling on Patrick's belly. SpongeBob walks up to them] Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now. [Gary's eyes lower] Gary the Snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me this instant! [SpongeBob struggles and pulls Gary off Patrick] Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary. [he walks off, Gary lets out a meow of sadness]
Patrick: Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!
SpongeBob: What's that supposed to mean?
Patrick: I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. Now, I suggest that you put him down and let him choose. [SpongeBob does so]
SpongeBob: Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him. Okay, Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary! [Gary turns around to Patrick] Uh, wrong way, Gary. [Ignoring, Gary is crawling toward Patrick] G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary! [he collapses as Gary crawls up to Patrick]
Patrick: Well, well, well… I guess that answers that question. [SpongeBob's eyes well up] So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do.
SpongeBob: [angrily, to Gary] Okay, fine, if that's how you want to thank me… [whimpers] ...for all that I've done?! [Patrick's rock falls down into place. Cut to SpongeBob's darkened room where SpongeBob is on his bed looking down at Gary's bowl. He sheds a tear into it] I guess you're not coming back, Gary. [angrily] I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend! [cut to Patrick running around laughing with Gary on his head. SpongeBob walks by with a giant worm by the leash. The worm is bluish green and is panting heavily] Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex! [Rex barks, SpongeBob pats him] Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks, too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit! [he waits, but Rex is just sitting there] Roll over, Rex, roll over! [Rex just sits there again] Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? [Patrick laughs and dances with Gary on his head] I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me. [loudly so Gary can hear] So loyal, so trusting, always by my side! [Rex barks and we see he's waiting for the bus across the street with a hitch-hiking hole with stuff in it. The bus comes and he rides off. Cut to SpongeBob entering the house with a pet carrying case] Who needs worms anyway? [SpongeBob puts down the case and opens the door] Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy. [a snail comes out. It's got big bushy black eyebrows and a tan shell, with the same design as Gary's] You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone whose name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary.
Lary: [in a deeper voice than Gary's] Meow. [Cut to Lary sitting at a table as SpongeBob walks over with a plate with a cover on it. SpongeBob is in chef garb]
SpongeBob: And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time! Ta-da. [he takes off the cover, it's snail food in Gary's bowl. But the Gary inscription now has an L written over the G] Bon appetite, Lary. [giggles. Lary sniffs it and hisses. SpongeBob quickly takes the bowl away, scared] Okay, maybe later. [walks backward. Cut to SpongeBob with his robe on, showing Lary the newspaper bed next to his own] This is where you sleep, Lary. [Lary goes over on it, hisses, and tears it up. Lary is now up on SpongeBob's bed] Uh, that's where I… [Lary hisses loudly and falls asleep instantly] I guess you can sleep there… [SpongeBob lays down on the shredded newspaper] I'll sleep down here. [lays some shreds on him like a blanket] Well, good night, Lary. [Lary hisses again. Cut to morning where Lary is watching TV. SpongeBob jumps in upside down and surprises him, causing him to hide in his shell] Hey, Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one! [clears throat] What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor! [laughs, Lary hisses and crawls away] Don't you get it, Lary? A snailor. [he deflates then he stands up] Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry. [he holds a real-life snail from his pocket. He looks at a photo of Gary] Oh, Gary, why did you have to go?! [cries] Why, Gary?! Why…?! Why, why, why, why, why, why?! [we hear Gary meow] Gary? [we see Patrick and Gary are behind him. Patrick is holding a basket of laundry]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Patrick.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Hello, Gary.
Patrick: Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?
SpongeBob: Laundry? But… we used to do laundry…
Patrick: And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?
SpongeBob: Soap? But… we used to use soap. [holds up two bottles] Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'… [tears up]
Patrick: Here it comes…
SpongeBob: Du… du… duuuuu… [cries] ttyyyyy! [his tears make both of the bottles bubble up] Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you! [stops crying] I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want. [runs up to the sofa and tears it up furiously] If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up! [runs up to the litter box] And the litter box? Forget about it! [he dumps the litter on his head] The world is your litter box! [he runs to the fridge and opens it] And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access! [he takes a milk carton and drinks it] And you don't even have to use a bowl! [he runs to a giant carving of Squidward] And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward. [scratches at it] Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary? [we see SpongeBob has carved Squidward into a heart]
Patrick: How pathetic…
SpongeBob: Gary…? [the heart breaks in half and one half hits him. The two walk to the laundry room]
Patrick: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it, SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself. [he takes off his shorts and puts them in the machine; Gary crawls in after them] It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary? [the two notice Gary is in the machine, nudging in Patrick's shorts] He only liked me for my shorts!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket! [Gary is indeed eating the cookie. He finishes and crawls out up to SpongeBob]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: G-G-Gary? [Gary burps and happily meows] Whee! [he hugs Gary] Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww… [giggles, he takes his leash] Let's go for a walk, pal! [the two walk out.]
Patrick: Gary? I thought what we had was special...!

  
 [It's another day at Mrs. Puff's Boating School as SpongeBob skids along his way to failing his driving test again]
 French Narrator: Here we are again at the Bikini Bottom Boating School. Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year, [cut to a shot of SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff's car coming straight to the camera] ...and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means another [starts going into a screaming tone] whole yeAR OF BOATING SCHOOL!! [Shows a static scene as SpongeBob crashes into the camera and glass breaks. Back on regular view, the cameraman is seen to have fallen over. The French Narrator groans.]
 SpongeBob: ...whahappened?
 Mrs. Puff: Oh, nothing SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian. [writes on clipboard] Minus 20 more points.
 SpongeBob: How many does that leave me with?
 Mrs. Puff: Negative 224.
 SpongeBob: How many more minutes left in the test?
 Mrs. Puff: The test is over.
 SpongeBob: That's enough time, I can make up those points! [Sponge is about to pull into reverse]
 Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me! [the boat rams into reverse and Mrs. Puff screams.] It's too late, SpongeBob! [Mrs. Puff pleads Sponge to stop as Sponge knocks over a whole row of cones, knocks through a brick wall and crashes in front of the school's main building. The dust clears]
 SpongeBob: OK, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?
 Mrs. Puff: 6.
 SpongeBob: Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?
 Mrs. Puff: Six.
 SpongeBob: [raising arms slowly] Whooooooooooooo...
 Mrs. Puff: Hundred. [SpongeBob stops]
 SpongeBob: What?
 Mrs. Puff: 600. You need 600 to pass. You got 6.
 SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll be all right Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year! [he slams his fist down, which causes a piece of the motor to fly upward] Well, see you next Tuesday! [Sponge walks off and the piece crashes on Mrs. Puff. She inflates like she always does when Sponge crashes. SpongeBob runs out to his unicycle-like bike] Yeah! [singing] I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year. [goes around in circles on his bike] One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! [Mrs. Puff looks on, still inflated]
 Mrs. Puff: [thinking] Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole! [starts to talk, when she does, she deflates to her normal size] Extra crediiiiit!
 SpongeBob: What was that, Mrs. Puff? [Mrs. Puff runs over and shakes him in joy]
 Mrs. Puff: Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit! [laughing wildly] I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.
 SpongeBob: What's extra credit?
 Mrs. Puff: It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.
 SpongeBob: [singing] Oh….. [cut to Sponge at his desk]
 Mrs. Puff: Now, are we ready for that extra credit?
 SpongeBob: Extra credit!
 Mrs. Puff: That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a 10-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.
 SpongeBob: But I've learned so many things.
 Mrs. Puff: Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started. [SpongeBob writes what she says] "What I learned in boating school is…" There! That's already 7 words! Only 3 more!
 SpongeBob: [writing] L… e… a… r… [pencil snaps] Oh, barnacles.
 Mrs. Puff: What's wrong?
 SpongeBob: Got to sharpen my pencil. [Sponge whistles as he walks to the sharpener. He then sharpens it multiple times to get just the right sharpness. Mrs. Puff begins to sweat. Sponge is finally satisfied and walks back to his desk] N… e… [pencil breaks again, he walks to the sharpener again, Mrs. Puff stops him, grabs the pencil and holds out a pen]
 Mrs. Puff: Give me that! Here's a pen.
 SpongeBob: A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils. [walks back to desk singing] Gonna write an essay, that's what I say. [SpongeBob finishes] There.
 Mrs. Puff: Fantastic, let me see it.
 SpongeBob: No, wait! I changed my mind! [erases some stuff out]
 Mrs. Puff: I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see. [Sponge jumps on top of his paper]
 SpongeBob: Don't look! It's not ready.
 Mrs. Puff: It's so simple, only 10 words! "What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity, [her eyes grow bulging veins] Blank!"
 SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!
 Mrs. Puff: "What I learned in boating school is…!" "What I learned in boating school is…!"
 SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this! [starts to pant] Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here? [screams] My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop! [Mrs. Puff jumps on Sponge and forces the pen to push on the paper]
 Mrs. Puff: You only need 3… more… words! [the desk finally collapses and breaks. Mrs. Puff reaches for the essay] OK, let me see what you've written. [SpongeBob grabs on]
 SpongeBob: It's not ready yet.
 Mrs. Puff: It's OK, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.
 SpongeBob: No!
 Mrs. Puff: Give it to me! [the 2 pull on it]
 SpongeBob: No!
 Mrs. Puff: Let me see it! [the page rips in half. Mrs. Puff grabs Sponge's piece and attempts to read it] "What I learned in boating school is…" Uh… [on the page, it says 'What I learned in boating school is how to drive.' 'School,' 'how' and 'drive are crossed out and below are pictures of a boat, Sponge and a jellyfish] Well, the rest doesn't matter! [throws the 2 pieces on the floor] You pass! [laughs] You pass!
 SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.
 Mrs. Puff: That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.
 SpongeBob: Really?
 Mrs. Puff: Besides, here's your license. [gives it to SpongeBob]
 SpongeBob: My license! [licks it] It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-
 Mrs. Puff: [dragging him out the door] Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!
 SpongeBob: Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants! [echoes] SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants! [fades to a vision of Mrs. Puff's fears] La La La La! [he hits many pedestrians] La La La La! [he crashes through Harold and Frank]
 Fish: [crushed by the bus when SpongeBob hits it] Ow!
 [A small birthday party is going on]
 Partygoers: Harris, happy birthday! [SpongeBob runs over them] My leg!
 News Reporter: So much destruction...this reporter asks, "Why?" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who- [SpongeBob runs him over] OOF!
 SpongeBob: La la la la!
 Reporter: Let's- not- use that take. [Fades to reality]
 Mrs. Puff: That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive. [Later that night while walking home] Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.
 [she opens the door and turns on the light to see the SquarePants Family standing in the center of her living room with a huge round cake in the middle saying, "Thank You, Mrs. Puff! "]
 The SquarePants': Surprise!
 SpongeBob: To the greatest teacher ever!
 Mr. SquarePants: Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family. [kisses her hand for a long while]
 Mrs. SquarePants: I think you made your point, Dear.
 Mr. SquarePants: Ahem. [blushes, and walks back to the family] Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!
 Mrs. Puff: Well, I...Okay.
 Mrs. SquarePants: We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...
 Mrs. Puff: See what?
 Mr. SquarePants: Ta-da. [reading back license plate: "IM-RDY"]
 Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob: A brand new boatmobile?!
 SpongeBob: For me...? [faints and hits the cake, cutting out a perfect square. The family is in the car ready to drive away with SpongeBob still passed out in the backseat]
 Mrs. SquarePants: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff...he'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!
 Mrs. Puff: What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name...! No. Not again! I've got to end this before it begins.
 [In SpongeBob's bedroom, he's laying in bed with his parents overlooking him]
 Mr. SquarePants: You took quite a buster there, son.
 SpongeBob: What I learned in Boating School today is!
 Mr. SquarePants: We're gonna hafta hold off on the driving there for a while, son.
 Mrs. SquarePants: That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat!
 [SpongeBob peeks out to see if it's all clear, then slides through the window and floats to his new boat]
 SpongeBob: Hi, Boaty. [he runs his hand on the side of the boat and gasps] Boaty, you're cold! [he stands up and lays his socks on the side of the door] Take my socks. [he jumps on the side and hugs it] Oh Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! [he kisses the throttle lever, sighs, then falls asleep. On the horizon, a shifty dark figure runs by. It's Mrs. Puff, wearing a black ski mask. She peeks over and jumps into the boat, checking to see if the coast is clear]
 Mrs. Puff: I hope I still remember how to do this. [she takes out a purple balloon and blows it up. She then forms it into a balloon animal and snickers to herself] Hehehe yeah… [she starts the boat and drives off. What she doesn't know is that she's sitting on an asleep SpongeBob. He wakes up and sees the sky moving]
 SpongeBob: Hey, I'm driving! [the two notice each other]
 SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff: Aaaaahhhhhh!

[Mrs. Puff skids off the road for a bit, then returns to normal]

 SpongeBob: [jumps up] Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SKIING! [gasp] Oh my gosh, I know who you are!
 Mrs. Puff: [nervous] No, you don't! You don't know who I am!
 SpongeBob: Yes I do! I know that you're...a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray. [takes it out. He sprays, but it's pointed the wrong way and it gets in his eyes and he screams] Somebody help me!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!! [Mrs. Puff kicks SpongeBob out of the boat]
 Mrs. Puff: Sorry SpongeBob, but it was for your own good. [we see SpongeBob supposedly running next to the boat, but he's actually riding his bike. Mrs. Puff speeds up faster and loses him]
 SpongeBob: Give me back my boat! [SpongeBob finally catches up to Mrs. Puff and slaps his hand on the windshield. He grabs with both hands and jumps up. Mrs. Puff skids and swerves to get him off but he's not budging] You'd better stop this boat! [Mrs. Puff slams the brake and SpongeBob falls to the ground. He's still hanging on and running] I'm not letting go. Nothing will stop me! Not even… [gasps. He sees a sign reading…] Giant clams?!?! [so, SpongeBob is dragged through a field of giant clams. He comes out with a bunch of pieces missing from him] I'm… not… letting… go! Even for… [gasps, when he sees another sign for…] CHEESE GRATERS!?! [so he skids through the cheese graters. Now he's just three yellow sponge strands with arms] If you think I'll let go for a little… [he then approaches the most dreaded sign of them all…] EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION?!?!?!?! OH, NOOO!!!! [cut back to Mrs. Puff]
 Mrs. Puff: Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes. [she turns on the radio, which bears a striking resemblance to SpongeBob. It is SpongeBob, in the shape of a radio: his eyes are knobs, mouth the speaker, and so on]
 SpongeBob as Radio: And now back to K.R.U.D. with all of your personal "you won't get away with stealing my car!" hits! [Mrs. Puff screams as SpongeBob squeezes out of the box and jumps on Mrs. Puff. They get into a giant brawl and the car goes out of control. Two cops look on]
 Cop 1: Hey, look. [the car then flies off a cliff and straight for the squad car. The two policemen scream as they are now scared out of their wits. While plummeting, SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are still brawling]
 SpongeBob: I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were… [he rips off the ski mask, revealing who the culprit is] … Mrs. Puff!?! [SpongeBob flaps his lips in disbelief in a hypnotic background as the car crashes into the police car. Seconds later, the siren goes off. Later, SpongeBob is calling Mrs. Puff on the phone. Every time a person talks, it cuts to them] So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?
 Mrs. Puff: Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to… apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.
 SpongeBob: So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?
 Mrs. Puff: I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.
 SpongeBob: You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student [cut to see that Mrs. Puff is talking to SpongeBob from jail, through that visiting window]. And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?
 Mrs. Puff: What's that? [pan out from the jail exterior]
 SpongeBob: [from inside] Free driving lessons! [laughs]

 
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join Bikini Bottom's noblest, boldest, oldest superheroes as they bravely prepare for vacation. [both pack their clothes into their bags while the words “FOLD” and “PACK” come up] But wait! While our heroes relax at Leisure Village... who will watch the Mermalair?! [Barnacle Boy opens the doors and SpongeBob and Patrick jump in]
SpongeBob: ManSponge...
Patrick: ...and BoyPatrick...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Reporting for duty!
Barnacle Boy: Yeah, yeah, follow me.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Up, up, and awayyyyyy!!
Mermaid Man: EVIL!
Barnacle Boy: Now, we want you boys to keep an eye on the place. Water the plants, and make sure that...
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh, Patrick! This is the greatest wall of superhero secret gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!
Patrick: I get the Aqua-Glove!
Mermaid Man: Hold on there, boys! You cannot play with this stuff!
SpongeBob: What about the Orb of Confusion? [turns the orb on and makes confused faces]
Mermaid Man: [turns it off] No, no! Prolonged exposure to the Orb of Confusion will give you... uh... confusion!
Patrick: [opens the boat's door] What about the Invisible Boatmobile?
Barnacle Boy: Especially not the Invisible Boatmobile! [closes the boat's door] When we say don't touch anything, we mean don't. Touch. Anything! Do you understand?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Loud and clear, trusted boy companion!
Barnacle Boy: Well, great. Here are the keys. [SpongeBob takes the key from his hand] We'll see you in a week.
Mermaid Man: [both run out the door] UP, UP, AND AWAYYYYYY!
SpongeBob: Come, BoyPatrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay! [both flip into the other room while letting out battle cries]
Patrick: Huh? MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA...
SpongeBob: What is it, trusted sidekick?
Patrick: MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA!
SpongeBob and Patrick: MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! Man Ray! Aaaaaaaahhh! [both hide]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?
SpongeBob: Looks like he's frozen or something.
Patrick: FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO!
SpongeBob: It appears to be some sort of prison chamber... [licks the chamber] ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible! Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him! [Patrick pulls the lever down to UNFREEZE] Pat, what are you doing!?! We're not supposed to touch anything!
Patrick: But you said you had a question.
SpongeBob: We could get in trouble!
Patrick: Well, that's not a question. [they both argue when Man Ray's eyes start to light up]
SpongeBob: They said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! [pulls level up back to FREEZE]
Man Ray: I'm free! Hahaha!
SpongeBob: Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.
Man Ray: By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once!
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that.
Man Ray: Why... NOT?!
SpongeBob: Because you're evil!
Man Ray: You mean, if I was good, then you'd let me go?
SpongeBob: Yeah, sure, why not?
Man Ray: Then, uhhh, in that case... I am good.
SpongeBob: Really?
Man Ray: Yes, really.
SpongeBob: Really, really?
Man Ray: Yes. Yes. Really, really.
SpongeBob: Really Really Really???
Man Ray: YES, YES, ALREADY! I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD! NOW, LET ME OUT OF HERE OR YOU'LL SUFFER DIRE CONSEQUENCES!!
SpongeBob: Well, that's good enough for me. [SpongeBob pulls the lever back to "UNFREEZE" Man Ray is unfrozen and falls to the ground]
Man Ray: You fools! Prepare to be eradicated! [tries to jump at SpongeBob and Patrick but stops in mid-air and falls to the ground then laughs] What's wrong with me? Hahaha! What is this, HAHA HEH HEH HA, infernal contraption!?
SpongeBob: Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode 17!
Narrator: [showing a picture of the belt] As seen in episode 17!
Patrick: Oh, I love that episode.
SpongeBob: Oh, me too, me too!
Man Ray: I'll never get out of here wearing this belt! [chuckles] I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me. [chuckles again] Time for those acting lessons to pay off.
SpongeBob: Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
Man Ray: Oh, boohoo! Oh, sob! Oh, cry! [opens and closes his eyes] Oh, woe is me! You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
SpongeBob: We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go!
Man Ray: [turns around] Ahh, that would be fantastic! [chuckles] I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready for your first day at goodness school? [Man Ray puts an apple on his desk] Pat, get your wallet out. [Patrick gets his wallet out of his pocket] Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet. [Patrick tosses it on the ground] Now, what do you do?
Man Ray: Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet.
Patrick: Doesn't look familiar to me.
Man Ray: What? I just saw you drop it. Here.
Patrick: Nope, it's not mine.
Man Ray: It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.
Patrick: Return what to who?
Man Ray: [facepalms, then shows Patrick his ID] ...Aren't you Patrick Star?
Patrick: Yup.
Man Ray: And this is your ID.
Patrick: Yup.
Man Ray: I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet.
Patrick: That makes sense to me.
Man Ray: Then take it.
Patrick: It's not my wallet.
Man Ray: [in anger and frustration] You dim ball! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off! [SpongeBob pushes tickle button and Man Ray laughs]
SpongeBob: Ah-ah! Wrong. [SpongeBob pushes button] Good people don't rip other people's arms off! [Man Ray chuckles] Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?
Man Ray: Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help with... [Patrick drops package on Man Ray's foot] Ow!
Patrick: Oops, sorry. Can I start over?
Man Ray: I noticed you was... [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
Patrick: Oops! Gotta start again.
Man Ray: Would, [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
Patrick: Oops!
Man Ray: [Growls in anger] You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?!
Patrick: My wallets.
Man Ray: [Screams in fury. He grabs Patrick's head]
Patrick: No! SpongeBob, tickle him! [Man Ray slams Patrick into the ground. SpongeBob presses the tickle button]
Man Ray: [laughs] It tickles, but it's worth it! [continues slamming Patrick into the ground, while still laughing]
SpongeBob: Alright, goodness lesson number three. [Patrick is shown angry and severely injured] Uhh, let's see. [Patrick grabs the remote]
Patrick: I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?
Man Ray: Umm... 62?
Patrick: Wrong! [pushes button]
Man Ray: Haha! Stop!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.
Patrick: Let go of it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad!
Patrick: Let go!
SpongeBob: No, you let go!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Let... GO! [remote breaks and the belt goes hay-wire]
Man Ray: Frequency rising. Belt out of control. Hahahaha. Belt on too hard. [he continues to laugh] It's tickling my DNA. Make it stop! [tears come out as he laughs] Haha. Please!!
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.
Patrick: Peanuts?
SpongeBob: No. Please.
Patrick: Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.
SpongeBob: Rehabilitated.
Patrick: Gesundheit.
SpongeBob: It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future. [unlocks the belt, then the tickling stops] Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness. [Man Ray takes the Aqua-Glove off the wall of weapons] Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff. [Man Ray put the glove on his hand and activates it] We're not supposed to touch that, either. [Man Ray grabs the Cosmic-Ray and attaches it on the Aqua-Glove] We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. [He aims the weapon at SpongeBob and Patrick] Good people have no use for weapons such as... [Man Ray zaps them into dust] thoooooooooose!
Man Ray: [laughs] The only thing I'm good at is being evil. [door opens and Man Ray runs] So long, suckers!
Patrick: What's that smell, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.
Patrick: Good, I thought it was my skin.
SpongeBob: Forget about your skin, Patrick! Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him! This is a job for Mermaid Man...
Patrick: ...and Barnacle Boy! [both slide down the poles and get their costumes on]
SpongeBob: To the Invisible Boatmobile! [both stop in the invisible boat]
Patrick: Ignition, on!
SpongeBob: Wait! I don't have a license!
Patrick: Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. [shapes hand into a rectangle]
SpongeBob: You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy. [they scream as the boat rams through the wall and into a street light]
Patrick: Thank goodness for invisible seat belts!
Man Ray: Out of my way, fools! You no longer have control of me. And now this town belongs to Man Ray!
SpongeBob: Not so fast, arch-villain! We still have the Orb of Confusion! [Patrick takes out the Orb of Confusion] Take this! [turns it on and gets all confused] Doy... Duh...
Man Ray: Well, that was easy. [heads to the bank where he kicks in the door] Hahaha! All right, people! Everybody stand right where you are!
[citizens gasp]
Man Ray: I want you to, uh... [Man Ray chuckles, so everyone else chuckles, too] No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to... [chuckles again, so everyone else is still chuckling] STOP LAUGHING, YOU FOOLS!
Bank Lady: What can I do for you, sir?
Man Ray: I'll tell you what you can do! [points glove at the lady] Gimme all of your... [Man Ray chuckles again] G-gimme, gimme all of your... [Man Ray is still chuckling] Give me...! [he chuckles so much he realizes what's going on] Aah! The belt is gone, but I still feel its tickle! The urge to do bad is gone! [sighs] I guess I'll just open a checking account. [Man Ray returns to SpongeBob and Patrick and turns the Orb of Confusion off]
SpongeBob: Doy... [gasps] Man Ray!
Man Ray: No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them! [Man Ray takes his head off and gives it to SpongeBob] I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder. [walks off] 
SpongeBob: Bye, Man Ray! Wow, we did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We saved the day! Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: Uhh... [still has a confused look on his face]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Woo-hoo? Patrick?


[Lights are circling outside the Krusty Krab. Inside, there is a sign hanging from the ceiling that says 'Komedy Krab'.]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, everybody settle down. Welcome [pauses] to the Komedy Krab! [Puts an arrow on his eyes. Everyone laughs] Now please give a warm welcome to our first comic, the indiscernible Dougie Williams! [Dougie walks onto the stage as Mr. Krabs walks out]
Dougie Williams: Good evening, folks. I'm going to skip the jokes and get right to the part where I throw pies at you! [Pulls out a cart of pies. The crowd takes out their umbrellas. SpongeBob opens the curtain from behind and gets splattered with pie]
SpongeBob: [Laughs] I hope I do as good as that guy.
Dougie Williams: [Backstage] Man, those people will laugh at anything. Hey, don't sweat it kid, I got them all worked up for you.
Mr. Krabs: Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants! [SpongeBob walks out with a bow tie on]
Sandy: Go get 'em, SpongeBob!
Patrick: [Sitting at a table with Sandy] Whoo-hoo! [SpongeBob gives them a thumbs-up]
SpongeBob: Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers? I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean?
[No one laughs. A cricket is heard chirping. Cut to a live-action clip of a cricket chirping.]
SpongeBob: And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things? [Chuckles weakly. Crowd is still silent] I mean, you chop them up into slices, but... [Cut again to the cricket, who is no longer chirping.] What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup? [Chuckles weakly]
Fred: Oh, brother, THIS GUY STINKS!
Harold: HEY, HEY, FUNNY GUY! I'VE GOT A JOKE FOR YOU! WHAT SMELLS ROTTEN AND PUTS PEOPLE TO SLEEP?
SpongeBob: Umm, noxious gas?
Harold: NO! YOUR ACT! [Everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: Did you ever notice how, uhh... [Notices a fork on a table] ...forks, uhh...
Fred: Forks?! Come on! [Crowd is booing]
SpongeBob: [Thinking] Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation! [Looks around for material then notices Sandy's teeth] Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are? [Crowd chuckles]
Fish: That's true.
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things. [Crowd laughs more] And what's up with that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home, too. [Crowd laughs loud]
Patrick: [Laughing] Squirrel fur!
SpongeBob: And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt. [Crowd laughs] Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?
Fred: WHY?
SpongeBob: Because, they're so darn stupid! [Crowd laughs]
All: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Patrick: That's a good one, huh, Sandy?
Sandy: Uhh, y-yeah... [SpongeBob walks behind the curtain where Mr. Krabs is waiting for him]
Mr. Krabs: That was fantastic, boy! You really knocked 'em out! I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!
SpongeBob: I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is.
Mr. Krabs: The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show. [Hands SpongeBob a mop]
SpongeBob: Well, at least I don't have to clean up my act! [Laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy. Now get busy! [Walks off]
SpongeBob: Mops, mops, mops, what's up with those things? I mean, really. [Walks up to Sandy] Oh, hey, Sandy!
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Did you enjoy the show?
Sandy: Well, ac-actually, SpongeBob, n-no. Those jokes are hurtful and you know it.
SpongeBob: Come on, Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom.
Sandy: Well, I can't argue with that.
SpongeBob: We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time! [Holds up a mirror and laughs excessively into it. Sandy chuckles]
 Sandy: You're right, SpongeBob. I was being a little too sensitive. [Both hug] No hard feelings. [Scene cuts to Sandy at Barg'N-Mart] Okay, deodorant. Huh, let's see. Roll-on or stick? [Fred and Nancy walk by]
Fred: I think she should buy both. [Laughs]
Sandy: Huh?
Scooter: Hey, look, guys! [Seen with Lloyd and Eddy] It's the stupid squirrel!
Lloyd: I know, let's try to communicate with it.
All: Duh... [Making funny faces, then walk off laughing]
Sandy: Hmph! [Throws the deodorant into the cart, then walks up to a little kid] Hello, little critter! What's your name?
Mable: [Grabs her child] Don't stand too close to a squirrel, Billy. You'll catch its stupid. [Walks off]
Billy: Okay, mom.
Sandy: Stupidity isn't a virus. But it sure is spreading like one. [Scene cuts to the Komedy Krab where everyone is chanting for SpongeBob. SpongeBob is sitting at a desk preparing for his act]
SpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid.
Sandy: Hey, uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Sandy.
Sandy: Umm, I need to talk to you about them squirrel jokes.
SpongeBob: We already talked about that, remember? [Looks in a mirror and laughs]
Sandy: SpongeBob, this is serious. Since you've been telling them jokes, people have been treating me different. [Patrick walks backstage]
Patrick: SpongeBob, five minutes. [Notices Sandy, then talks slowly] Hel-lo... Sandy. Me Patrick. Do you un-der-stand? [Sandy looks away] Squirrels. [Walks off]
Sandy: Y-y-you see? That's what I'm talking about!
SpongeBob: Ah, that's just Patrick. He's just fooling around.
Sandy: I'm just asking you as a friend, please lay off them squirrel jokes, okay? Tell some of them other jokes you got.
SpongeBob: [Nervously] Other jokes? [Imagines the fork joke] Bah! I got a million of them.
Sandy: [Hugs SpongeBob] Thanks, SpongeBob, I knew you'd understand. [Walks to her seat. The crowd is still chanting for SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants! [Everyone cheers as SpongeBob walks out]
SpongeBob: Uhh, hi. [Chuckles nervously] Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish. [Crowd is confused] I guess you heard that one.
Sandy: I haven't heard it! Good one, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water? I mean, the stuff's everywhere.
Patrick: Tell the one about the squirrel and the light bulbs!
SpongeBob: Uhh... [takes out a big rubber chicken] Hey, what about this thing? Huh? Huh?
Fish #5: Get on with the squirrel jokes! [Crowd chants for squirrel jokes]
SpongeBob: [thinking] What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make: [Looks at Sandy] your friends... [Looks at his microphone] ...or your career.
[After a beat, he drops the microphone and everyone gasps. He walks backstage then, after a beat, jumps back on stage with hillbilly teeth]
SpongeBob: HOWDY, Y'ALLLLLLLLLL!!! [Crowd cheers loudly] How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?!
All: BECAUSE THEY'RE SO. DARN. STUPID!
SpongeBob: [Laughs as he walks around tooting a bicycle horn] My people! [Sandy gets angry] But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy. [Spotlight on Sandy as the two women around her giggle] Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes. [to audience] Am I right?! [Crowd cheers; to Sandy] Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you. Do you understand now, Sandy, huh, do ya?
Sandy: [deadpan] I understand everything that's going on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Great. I knew sooner or later you'd understand. What a great sport! [to audience] Let's give a big hand to Sandy. But clap slow, because remember, SHE'S A SQUIRREL! [Crowd is cheering their loudest] Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night! [Walks backstage] Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob. [Sees a note taped to his mirror] Oh, what's this, a fan letter? [Reads it]
Sandy: [voiceover] You were right, SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate. Sandy.
SpongeBob: You did it, SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to the Treedome with his water helmet on and flowers in his hands. He knocks on the door as the water empties from the Treedome] I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy. [Door opens] Good morning, Sandy.
[He stares on; Sandy is dressed as a hillbilly with flies floating around her]
Sandy: Well, hooOOOoowwWWWw-deeeEEEeeeEEee!
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you feeling alright?
Sandy: I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self! [Licks her teeth with her tongue. SpongeBob laughs nervously] Well, come on in! Y'all must be tired from telling them funny jokes all the time. Why don't you take a load off? [Pushes him onto a log with glue on it]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat.
Sandy: Naw, [Holds up a brush and a bucket of glue] I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off. [Gasps and grabs the flowers that SpongeBob was holding] Are them flowers for me?! You even done got me a vase! [Takes SpongeBob's water helmet off his head]
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, that, that's not a... [Sandy places the flowers in the water helmet]
Sandy: Ain't that purdy?
SpongeBob: [already dried out] SANDY, I NEED WA...
Sandy: Oh, that's right! You's a sea critter. Now what was that thing that sea critters need? Umm, uhh... let's see... [A big lump in her throat wiggles up and down] UHH, UHH, SEA CRITTERS NEED...
SpongeBob: WAAAA...
Sandy: [covers SpongeBob’s mouth] Oh, wait, don't tell me. I know this one!
SpongeBob: WAAAA...
Sandy: A Wallet? A Watch? Waffles?
SpongeBob: [hoarsely] SANDY. WATERRRR.
Sandy: Well, why didn't you just say so? [Puts the end of a hose in SpongeBob's mouth] Here you go! Yup, us squirrels sure is stupid. [Connects the other end of the hose to a pipe then turns it on. SpongeBob enlarges as more water enters into him]
SpongeBob: Sandy!
Sandy: Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb.
SpongeBob: Sandy! Okay, Sandy, I get it!
Sandy: What's that? You want more? [Connects to the end of the hose to a bigger pipe and turns it on] Okey-dokey! More water for the sea-critter! [SpongeBob is still enlarging]
SpongeBob: Okay, Sandy, okay!! I get it! [SpongeBob is filled up every inch of the Treedome] No more squirrel jokes... [Scene cuts to the Komedy Krab where the crowd is chanting for SpongeBob again. SpongeBob, who has bandages on his face, goes on stage] Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel. [winks at Sandy. cut to Patrick show his happily exciting smile, Sandy blinks with a smirk] And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of your squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb?' [Crowd laughs] But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge. [Crowd is silent] I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae. [Twists himself] Look at me! I got no bones!
Fish #6: That's true. [Crowd laughs]
SpongeBob: Crabs? Oh, brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] It's true, I am cheap!
SpongeBob: Now, let me tell you about those fish. Boy, are they smelly. Whoo-hoo, how could a creature who spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really. [Imitates a fish] "SOAP, SOAP. WHAT IS SOAP?" [Crowd laughs more. SpongeBob and Sandy give each other a thumbs-up as the scene cuts to an outside view of the Krusty Krab] And don't even get me started on starfish!


Sandy: [looking at the clouds] You know, SpongeBob, sometimes, it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by.
SpongeBob: Yup, and just relax.
Sandy: Yeah. Relax.
SpongeBob: OOOH! Ooh-ooh-ooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
Sandy: What?
SpongeBob: A flower.
Sandy: They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time.
SpongeBob: They sure do.
Sandy: You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty.
SpongeBob: Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
Sandy: Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
SpongeBob and Sandy: [both laugh] Me.
SpongeBob: That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.
Sandy: Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See? [points to her acorn patch]
SpongeBob: I thought that meant you were nuts.
Sandy: Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby. And if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength! [his fingers flex] What do you say to that, "Miss Mittens"?
Sandy: I'd say I'm already halfway there!
SpongeBob: Aaaaah! [begins to climb the mountain] No fair, Sandy! You got a head start!
Sandy: Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles! [collapses the rock SpongeBob is climbing on]
SpongeBob: Hey! [gets back on another rock] You did that on purpose!
Sandy: Yeah, but this is an accident! [unleashes more rocks at him]
SpongeBob: [screams] Aaaaahhhhhhh!!
Sandy: Too bad you forgot your umbrella!
SpongeBob: [holds on to an umbrella and floats up] ♪ I didn't! ♪ [laughing, reaches the top of the cliff]
Sandy: [sitting in a lounge chair, reading a newspaper] Well, it's about time you showed up.
SpongeBob: But you were... I saw you by the... I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
Sandy: Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter.
SpongeBob: I can underwater! I'm... [Low voice] Hydrodynamically designed! [Normal voice] Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
Sandy: Why don't you ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you say to that, HydroPants?
SpongeBob: I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there! [zooms out to reveal a record player] -halfway there!-halfway there!
Sandy: [gasps] Hey!
SpongeBob: [running at the bottom of the mountain, laughing, hits a brick wall]
Sandy: [jumps on SpongeBob's face and over the brick wall] Thanks for the face lift! [runs into the Krusty Krab, laughing] You see? I told ya you didn't have a chan-
SpongeBob: [dressed as an old man] There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature [licks lips] waiting! [rips off suit, laughing]
Sandy: I thought y'all wanted a rematch.
SpongeBob: I did! And I took a head start like you did!
Sandy: Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!
SpongeBob: I guess we don't, air breather!
Sandy: Water sucker!
SpongeBob: Tree climber!
Sandy: Gulf streamer!
SpongeBob: Kite flier!
Sandy: Chum chewer!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Take that back! You- [nervously] not wet person!
Sandy: Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!
SpongeBob: Proves what?
Sandy: That land critters are better than sea critters!
Patrick: [walks to the two] Better at what?
Sandy Cheeks: Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!
Squidward: [walks to the three] What's she blabbering about?
Patrick: She says land creatures are best.
Sandy: Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur styling and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking [Mr. Krabs joins the four] and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs all gasp]
Sandy: And name calling, for sure!
Squidward: And drowning, don't forget drowning!
SpongeBob: [laughing] Good one, Squidward! [jumps to high five Squidward, but freezes in midair] Woo!
Squidward: Not on your life, sport. [SpongeBob falls]
SpongeBob: I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel. [SpongeBob and the rest except Sandy start laughing until SpongeBob signals them to stop] But you're still just a land creature.
Sandy: Squirrels can do anything they want to!
Patrick: I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite. [gulps a big patty down] Ah.
Sandy: [reaches offscreen for the same big patty] Give me that. They don't call me cheeks for nothin'. [tries to eat it, but it splatters on her air helmet. Everyone, but Sandy and Patrick, begins to laugh]
Patrick: Thank you, thank you.
Sandy: Well, that's just one thing.
Mr. Krabs: Can you do this? [pops his eyestalks in and out of his head] Everyone in my family can do that.
Sandy: [Tries to do it] Uh...uh...
Squidward: How about this? [balances six spinning plates on a stick with his tentacles] Huh?
SpongeBob: Can you reproduce by budding? [begins to do it] Can ya? Can ya? Huh? Can ya?
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: Most importantly, can you do this!? [all except Sandy make their eyes big and round, and begin gasping three times without releasing any breath]
Sandy: Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?
SpongeBob: Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if it wasn't for that suit, you couldn't even live down here! [everyone but Sandy starts laughing]
Sandy: Well, you don't... [all continue laughing] I don't need to... [all laughing harder] Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit! [rips off suit, and all gasp] And I don't need this helmet neither! [throws helmet to ground, releasing an air bubble]
Mr. Krabs: Neptune preserve her!
Squidward: How long can she stay like that?
SpongeBob: I don't know!
Patrick: Sandy's a girl?!
SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe... [he, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs chuckle while Sandy winks] Yep, won't be long now. [she starts struggling to hold her breath] Feelin' light-headed yet?
Sandy: Mm-mm. [Sandy shakes her head]
SpongeBob: Remember this? [SpongeBob takes a deep breath in and out]
Mr. Krabs: It's free! [also takes a deep breath in and out]
Sandy: [Starts suffocating underwater. Screen shows her insides where her lungs shrivel and her left lung breaks and falls off. She suffocates, looks around, runs to the counter, and quickly digs through multiple objects, then puts her head into a pickle jar and breathes heavily. All the others start laughing] Stop laughing at me!
Mr. Krabs: I knew it! There was no way some "airhead" was gonna win anything against a water breather!
Patrick: Airhead... [laughs. The top of his head deflates like a balloon] Huh? [puts thumb in mouth and blows. His head becomes round at the top]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water!
Sandy: All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya?! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!
Squidward: Do we have to wear pickle jars? [All, except Sandy, laugh]
Sandy: Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs.
SpongeBob: One minute? No problem, Landy! [All but Sandy begin to laugh]
Sandy: [all but her are still laughing, as she leads them all to an island rising out of the water from the seafloor, as they see the island, they stop laughing] Well? So are you going or not?
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stammering] Uh, well, uh, uh, um...
SpongeBob: Actually, you know, but...
Squidward: We can't, uh...because...
Mr. Krabs: We're late for, um...
Patrick: Our fitting!
Sandy: Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes?
Patrick: [holding and eating popcorn] Hey! We are not chicken! [drops popcorn] Huh! My popcorn! [begins pecking at it like a chicken]
SpongeBob: Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it. [looks at the water's surface and pokes his finger above the water] There. Mission accomplished.
Sandy: Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!
SpongeBob: No way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!
Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: We're not afraid of your dumb old land!
Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: We're sea creatures!
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Okay... Well, this is it.
Mr. Krabs: Wait, boy, [gives him a glass of water] ...make it last.
SpongeBob: [drinks from it] Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay. [gulps hard, and starts running] Here I go! [gasps out of real water; he's now a real yellow kitchen sponge on a stick; he breathes heavily] Hey! This isn't so bad! [proceeds up to the real island] We can do this. Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!
Patrick: I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball! [jumps up out of the water. He's now a real pink starfish, missing his pants, on a stick] Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: All right, Pat, you made it!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here! [cut back to Squidward and Mr. Krabs left in the water]
Mr. Krabs: All ashore that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! [runs up] Land-ho! [he is a red rubber toy crab on a stick]
SpongeBob: Lookin' good, Mr. Krabs!
Patrick: Oh, yeah! Woohoo!
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward, you're missin' all the dry! Come on, Squidward!
SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs: [chanting] Squid-ward! Squid-ward! Squid-ward!
Squidward: [walking up] Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it.
SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs: [chanting] Squid-ward! Squid-ward! Squid-ward! Squid... [they stop chanting after Squidward walks up. He's a puppet octopus with his eyes and big, bulbous nose]
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: Well, here we are! [all four are walking on the island]
Squidward: This is pretty easy.
Patrick: I may keep a second rock up here.
Mr. Krabs: Once you get your land legs, it's not so bad!
SpongeBob: We're the masters of land and sea! [a string puppet seagull lands in front of them] Hey! It's a local. Hi! We're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks? [seagull looks towards the screen]
Sandy: 3. 2. 1. Well, tan my fur! They made it! Better go congratulate 'em. [walks onto the island. She's now a real plush squirrel toy with a small, round plastic helmet on her head] SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to? [we now see two seagulls terrorizing SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Patrick. One seagull has Patrick in it's mouth, the other is chasing around SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward. Sandy sees them and gasps.] Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! HI-YA! [she runs off camera and we hear karate noises and see feathers flying. She briefly backs into the camera's view, then runs off to fight again. All five sink back down to the seabed, with Squidward upside-down.]
SpongeBob: Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy.
Sandy: You know, everyone's best at something.
SpongeBob: But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy.
Sandy: Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!
All: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
All: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
Seagulls: [lying injured on the island with their feathers missing] Hooray.


[The episode starts at the Bikini Bottom Zoo.]
Narrator: Ah... the Bikini Bottom Zoo is having its annual Free Day. Free balloons...
[Jimmy gives Monroe a balloon but Mr. Krabs, disguised in a mustache, steals all the balloons from him.]
Narrator: Free drinks...
[Mr. Krabs comes by and fills up a huge barrel.]
Narrator: Free light bulbs?
[Mr. Krabs unscrews a light bulb from a path light and puts it into his pants just as the police arrive and become suspicious of him.]
Mr. Krabs: Aha! Top of the mornin', boys! [Laughs nervously] Whew! Next stop: gift shop.
[Mr. Krabs runs into the gift shop, then SpongeBob and Patrick walk by wearing zoo hats.]
SpongeBob: There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!
SpongeBob: [Like an announcer] He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball!
[SpongeBob crumples up his hat and spits it into the air and into a little fish's ice cream.]
Patrick: Why are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!
[The two run into the stadium]
SpongeBob and Patrick: This is the greatest day of our lives!
[Clamu is snoring and gurgling]
Patrick: This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring.
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. We came to see [Announcer voice] pearls 100 feet in the air! [normal voice] Right? I'll try my oyster call.
[SpongeBob makes a strange noise, but he gives up, because the oyster is asleep.]
Patrick: Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob.
[Patrick walks away.]
SpongeBob: Come on, come on, wake up already! [He pulls out his bag of sea peanuts. He looks left and right and then throws one at the oyster. The oyster stirs.] I think it's working!
[The oyster frantically looks around]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, it's waking up!
Patrick: Oh, boy, did I miss it?
SpongeBob: No, the show's about to begin!
[The oyster suddenly cries at the top of her lungs. SpongeBob and Patrick get blown away to the seats. The oyster hops around while bawling. Two zoo employees come running into the arena.]
Zoo Worker #1: What's wrong with Clamu?
Joe: Easy, girl! It's me, Joe! Remember?
[Clamu snarls as if it sounds like a belch and uses her tongue to throw Joe out of Oyster Stadium. Patrick and a nervous SpongeBob wait at the stands]
Patrick: Now, this is a show!
[Outside...]
Announcer: Attention, zoo patrons! Clamu, the giant oyster is on an emotional rampage! Please scream and run around in circles. [everybody runs for their lives and screams] Thanks for coming.
[In the stadium, Clamu is still smashing things and making snarling belch noises. The zoo worker goes up to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Zoo Worker #1: You boys better get out of this area, pronto! There's nothing more dangerous than an emotionally disturbed oyster. [The worker points menacingly at SpongeBob] You didn't do anything that might have caused this horrible tragedy, did you?
SpongeBob: Uh...
Patrick: No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob hides the peanut bag]
SpongeBob: Right. [SpongeBob lets out a nervous shriek]
[Clamu chomps on a piece of metal. Cut to Patrick and SpongeBob leaving the zoo]
Patrick: Man, if I ever see the guy who upset Clamu, I'd have a few choice words for him, like "you"... and... "are" ... and... "a jerk!" [SpongeBob and Patrick have now gotten to Conch Street, where their houses are] Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?
SpongeBob: I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh!
[Walks up his cobblestone path into his pineapple]
Patrick: Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!
SpongeBob: Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate! Now go home! [SpongeBob stomps into his pineapple, slamming the door behind him.] Stupid Patrick... I didn't do anything wrong! Aw, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory.
[He chuckles and turns on the TV]
Johnny: Our top story tonight: giant oyster has its feelings hurt! The only clue that could be found was this lone peanut! And as you can hear, the oyster continues to emit its horrible cry. A cry so powerful, it can be heard around the world. [TV is shown with real people covering their ears in Egypt, Holland, and India] A cry that not only breaks the sound barrier, it breaks the hearts of our citizens! [SpongeBob stares a the TV with a look of guilt and horror] What kind of cruel, careless, evil person would deliberately upset one of Neptune's most gentle creatures? [Hans uses a tissue to wipe a tear off Johnny's face. SpongeBob turns off the TV]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: [screams] No, Gary! How would I know anything about the oyster?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something? [He peers out the window at Oyster Stadium, where we still hear Clamu's wailing] This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now. Who could never hate me no matter what I do? [Cut to SpongeBob knocking on Squidward's door] Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Do you have to knock so loudly?!
SpongeBob: Sorry, neighbor.
Squidward: Oh... that overgrown clam is giving me a headache! I can't even take my afternoon beauty nap!
SpongeBob: [chuckles nervously] Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I... uh... was kind of wondering, um... Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster.
Squidward: You mean you know the guy who did it?!
SpongeBob: [gulps]
Squidward: Oh, this is great! You and I can go turn him in! And then I'll get so much sleep, I'll be gorgeous!
SpongeBob: Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically.
Squidward: You mean you don't know who did it?
SpongeBob: Well, um... I... uh... no. [Squidward slams the door in SpongeBob's face] Squidward? 
[SpongeBob walks away. On his way home, he encounters Patrick in a Sherlock Holmes outfit]
Patrick: Gotcha! [SpongeBob screams and jumps out of his pants]
Patrick: Where were you on the day of today? Don't play games with me, mister!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: Oh, hi, SpongeBob. I'm just continuing my investigation of the Great Clamu Caper!
SpongeBob: Um... have you found out anything?
Patrick: Yes! No, wait, uh... no. [Holds up sand] But this grain of sand looks pretty suspicious, [holds up a rock] and so does this rock! [Holds up magnifying glass to look at a piece of grass] And I've got a few questions for this little piece of grass! Don't worry, SpongeBob! Patrick's on the case! The truth will be revealed!
[SpongeBob runs away]
SpongeBob: I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do!
[We see Sandy and SpongeBob in the treedome, and Clamu is still shrieking]
Sandy: Oh, I can't stand it anymore! That poor, poor critter! What kind of inconsiderate person would upset such a gentle creature?
SpongeBob: Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy.
Sandy: Why, when I find out who caused that oyster so much pain, no more jiggery pokery!
[Holds up the Bikini Bottom Phone Book and rips it in half in front of SpongeBob]
Sandy: Now, what was it you wanted to talk about, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob tries to speak, but can't]
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob, how come you're all twitchy like that?
SpongeBob: Twitchy? Twitchy? Who's twitchy? I'm not twitchy! Sorry, Sandy, I have to, um... um... go get my hair cut. [He runs home]
Sandy: SpongeBob doesn't have hair... or does he?
[SpongeBob runs down the block panting. He runs to the house and tries to open the door. Patrick approaches him to talk]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is startled and he falls apart. His limbs and facial features all reattach in different places] This is it! All of the clues are coming together. I followed these footprints right to this exact spot, and then, right where you're standing, I found this bag of peanuts! Ha! Oh, I'm so close to solving this crime, I can almost taste it! [Zoom in on Patrick's mouth licking what appears to be SpongeBob's head. It is revealed to be instead licking a yellow ice cream pop that appears to be shaped like SpongeBob's head] Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow Popsicle hits the spot!
SpongeBob: Okay, uh, good luck with all that, Patrick, and, uh, I guess I'll see you later!
[He shuts the door, and inside]
Police Fish #1: Open up! This is the police!
[SpongeBob's eyes pop out of his head]
SpongeBob: Uh, uh, just a second!
[Two policefish bust in and one flashes his I.D]
Policefish #1: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
SpongeBob: Y-y-yes?
Policefish #1: Put those eyeballs back in your head, son. We've got a few questions for you.
[SpongeBob puts them in and twists them like a dial until they are positioned. Policefish #2 taps the baton on his hand while Policefish #1 talks.]
Policefish #1: Were you at the zoo on the day of the oyster incident?
SpongeBob: [stutters] Y-yes! [hides in his pants]
Policefish #1: Did you, or did you not take part in various activities of zoo-time merriment?
SpongeBob: Yes... [he sinks even lower into his pants]
Policefish #1: [holds up a peanut inside a ziploc bag with "Exhibit A" written on it] And are you familiar with... this peanut?
SpongeBob: Yes!
[His eyes peer out over the top of his pants. The bottom of his pants rip, and his body falls through.]
Policefish #1: Just one more question... Is it true that you were at the oyster's lair with a Mr. Patrick Star?
SpongeBob: [Sobbing] Yes! Yes! It's true! It's true! It's all true! The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick!
Policefish #1: That's all we need to know, son. Let's book 'im! [clink. The police put the cuffs on Patrick]
Patrick: Wow, you guys are good! I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time! It's the perfect crime!
Policefish #1: Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge, pinky!
[Police Man and Police Man 2 escort Patrick out]
SpongeBob: Oh, no! Patrick's too sensitive for the big house! [SpongeBob follows the police boat to the zoo] Wait! Stop! I'm the one you want! I am the criminal!
[crowd booing and yelling]
Sandals: [Cockney accent] Hey, everybody, let's throw peanuts at him and see how he likes it!
[The crowd is throwing the peanuts at Patrick..]
Patrick: I get what I deserve! [Crowd yelling. Patrick attempts to catch all the peanuts with his mouth.] Ouch.
SpongeBob: Wait! Hold your peanuts! Patrick Star is innocent! I have come here to reveal the truth! They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness!
Patrick: [humming while SpongeBob talks] Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum...
SpongeBob: I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I...
Sandals: Hey! Just get on with it!
SpongeBob: I am the one who threw the peanut! I know now that what I have done is wrong. And so I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster. I am sorry, Patrick. I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom. [Patrick stops humming]
Sandals:  Hey! Let's throw peanuts at both of them!
[crowd yelling]
Zoo Worker #1: [objecting] Wait! Here's the real criminal! [pulls Mr. Krabs out for the crowd to see]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, top of the mornin'! [his fake mustache falls off]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
[All gasping]
Patrick: I knew it!
Zoo Worker #1: Mr. Krabs has stolen a very important item from the oyster. [rips off Mr. Krabs' clothes by accident] Behold! [the crowd gets disgusted] Wait a minute... [reveals Clamu's pearl] Behold! The oyster's pearl! [The crowd gasps in shock; the zoo worker then gives the pearl to Clamu] Here you go, girl.
[Clamu sniffs her pearl and the crowd cheers. But suddenly, the pearl starts to crack. And to everyone's amazement, it hatches into a baby oyster.]
Baby Oyster: Mama! Mama!
SpongeBob: Mother of pearl! The oyster's a mother! And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg!
Baby Oyster: Mama!
Clamu: Aww!
[The baby oyster and Clamu embrace each other.]
All: Awww... [They glare at Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] But it's... Free Day!
[The crowd boos as they throw peanuts at Mr. Krabs, burying him.]


Version #1 (Original Airing/The First 100 Episodes Version)
Narrator: Ahoy, kids. It's time for SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special!
Pirates: Hooray!
Narrator: And now the host of You Wish. He's got puffier pantaloons than Captain Kidd, and fuzzier facial hair than Blackbeard. He's America's favorite Pirate, Patchy of Encino!
Patchy: [opens the door] Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to me quarters. Why don't come on back on the galley, I'm cooking up a little treat for you today. (walks inside, and to the kitchen) It's call-in-and-vote time. You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if you're technologically inclined. Now this cartoon is different from most cartoons in that-
Potty: Bawk! In what way?
Patchy: Well, if it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
Potty: Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Patchy: Argh... [Potty flies away] Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Where'd you go? [enters something] Potty? You in there, buddy? Potty? Potty?
[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window]
Potty: [laughing and squawking] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Patchy: Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Now, what was I saying? (Patchy walks to his desk with so many phones and sits down) Now, this cartoon ain't like most of your "land-lubbing cartoons". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to, call the number that's scrolling down there at the bottom of the screen: 1 (800) 624-4094 or go to Nick.com. ["1 (800) 624-4094" appears on the bottom of the screen (in the First 100 Episodes version, it says "Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!" instead). Phone starts ringing. Patchy picks up phone] No, not now! Don't call till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because- [More phones start to ring] You're not gonna make this easy, are ya? Quiet! I'm not there! Belate that ringing! Stop! It's driving me mad!
[episode starts]
SpongeBob: (yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward] Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
Squidward: [Looks at the anchor and annoyed at SpongeBob's idiocy]That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
Patrick: [Stupidly]Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
SpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?
Patrick: How about...
Squidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
SpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
Patrick: Clean...
Squidward: [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
SpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!
Patrick: Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
Narrator: A few inches later...
SpongeBob: [points up] Ship!
Patrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
SpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship![A giant green ship is seen. Patrick is shocked to see he was wrong while Squidward is not fazed.]
Squidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
Squidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
Squidward: All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says "owner" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
SpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?
Patrick: I don't know. Why?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
Patrick: Yes!
SpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says "property of the Flying Dutchman"]
Flying Dutchman: Rawr!
SpongeBob: No, no, it's not "rawr!"
Flying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob: That's it! [Stupidly]Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
Flying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
SpongeBob: [Oblivious]It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward as he waits for answer]
Squidward: [Nervously]I...no, I don't.
SpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
Squidward: [laughs nervously] I never said that.
Flying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
SpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
Squidward: [screams] Ow.
Flying Dutchman: [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back!
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
Squidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?
Patrick: Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: How 'bout now?
Patrick: Uhh...
Squidward: [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: Now listen. [takes out a "Ghost Rule Book"] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
Squidward: Will we be getting business cards?
Flying Dutchman: [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.
Squidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [holds up a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick watch Squidward disappear from sight with a clearly worried expression.]
Flying Dutchman: [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
SpongeBob: [Terrified]No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.
Patrick: [Terrified as well]We'll do anything you say!
Flying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
Patrick: And I got this hat!
Flying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
SpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
Patrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
SpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
Patrick: I don't get it.
SpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
Flying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
SpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?
Flying Dutchman: Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick are scared and start mopping]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
Flying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [bleats like a sheep]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
Flying Dutchman: [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [bleats like a sheep]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
[Very long and awkward silence]
Flying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
SpongeBob: Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy. The Flying Dutchman stares wide eyed, then nervously blows on the telescope, spinning it slightly to land on a little kid]
Billy: [sing-song voice] I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
Flying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
Patrick: Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
SpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
Flying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
Flying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confuse]
SpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
Flying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
Patrick: How does he do that?
Flying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!
Billy: Those guys are dorks.
Flying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
SpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Patrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
SpongeBob: Like movie passes?
Patrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
Flying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
SpongeBob: You're setting us free?
Flying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
Patrick: Wait, I have an idea!
SpongeBob: Really?! What is it?
Patrick: Let's leave!
SpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
Patrick: Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume. Someone even goes as far as removing Patrick's gas mask and spraying him in the face with perfume]
SpongeBob: [panting]I always hate going in there!
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
Flying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and sees SpongeBob and Patrick peeping on him before escaping.]
Flying Dutchman: [On the ship, SpongeBob and Patrick are running but the Dutchman pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
SpongeBob: Never!
Flying Dutchman: Okay, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No! [Sock begins to tear]
Flying Dutchman: [panicking]Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
Patrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Flying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
Patrick: Make it five.
Flying Dutchman: Four.
Patrick: Three. Take it or leave it.
Flying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
SpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
Patrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
Flying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [Taps Patrick on the shoulder]Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [Squidward is screaming as he falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]
Squidward: [Relieved]Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [disappears and re-appears on the ship.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back![Squidward looks around shocked.]
SpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
Squidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
Patrick: [Protesting]Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
SpongeBob: [Angrily]Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny-meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...
Voting Guy: All hands! All hands! Time to vote! It's voting time!
Patchy: Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good Ol' SpongeBob? Just dial the number below: 1 (800) 624-4094 or go to Nick.com and tell us who you be choosing. ["1 (800) 624-4094" appears on the bottom of the screen (again, in the First 100 Episodes version it has been changed to "Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!")] My trusty crew is eagerly awaiting your call. [Potty is shown sleeping against phones and a quote bubble with "Z" slides in] So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, and we'll be right back to announce...the winner! [Commercial break (in the original version, this happens)] That's it, kids! Keep calling! It's almost time! Get those votes in! A-Ha-Ha! WHOO! Democracy! A-Ha-Ha! WHOO! This is Patchy. Please hold. Potty's not here. Well, not yet. A-HA-HA-HA! [After commercial break] Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because it’s time for you to walk the plank! [Screen reads: PLEASE STAND BY] Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner! [blows horn] But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter-ology, you didn't choose...Patrick. [An image of Patrick is shown, with a skull in front of him.] But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh god!
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] My mother told me to pick the very best one and you are it! [Stops on Patrick.]
SpongeBob: That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
Patrick: Um...
Squidward: Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time... [demonstrates the length of eternity as if it were a piece of string. Patrick's eyes look at each end] Understand?!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.
Patrick: Uhh...
SpongeBob: That's not gonna do it! Think harder!
Patrick: Uhh...
Squidward and SpongeBob: [overlapping] Come on! You can do it! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Think really hard! Put on your thinking cap!
Patrick: Uhh... [Inside Patrick's eye is a toaster that brings up some toast.] Okay! I've got it.
Flying Dutchman: Thy wish is granted.
Patrick: [Chewing on gum.] Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum? [SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked.]
Squidward: You wished for gum?
Patrick: Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
[Each take a piece of gum. Later, we see Flying Dutchman with a big belly while everyone is begging for out.]
Flying Dutchman: Ahh, minty.
Patchy: Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Malarkey! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh! [An image of Squidward is shown, with a skull in front of him.] It appears you didn't vote for Squidward! I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either. But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Meeny-Miney-Mo finger landed on Squidward!
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [Stops on Squidward]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!
Squidward: That's right! And you know what I wish?
Patrick: No!
Squidward: I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Flying Dutchman: So be it.
SpongeBob: Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.
Patrick: Hi.
Squidward: That's not what I meant!
Flying Dutchman: Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner. [Flying Dutchman appears with a big belly]
SpongeBob: And what did you say your name was?
Squidward: I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
SpongeBob: Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward. [Tries to pronounce it right] We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess. [Laughs.]
Patchy: And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because it's time to announce...the winner! The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well, what do you know? The winner is...SpongeBob! [A flag is shown with SpongeBob with the words "Winner" on the left side, Patchy sniffs the air] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
Potty: Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]
Patchy: And now, the most requested ending! Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor]
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
Squidward: Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house but you can only see their heads]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Hooray!
SpongeBob: We're home!
Patrick: You did it, SpongeBob. We're safe!
Squidward: But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
Flying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. Fruit prevents scurvy! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast.]
Patchy: [sitting at the couch crying] Hold on! Sorry about that, kids! It’s just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lubbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now you're an official big time cartoon decision maker! [Cuts to a bunch of monkeys at a zoo] Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks, Potty! Potty!
Potty: Squawk! I quit! I quit!
Patchy: [growls] Well, that's it folks. Right now, I've got a little "employee management" to take care of. Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage!
Potty: Brawk! I don't think so!
Narrator: [while they argue] And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special. Thanks for voting.
Patchy: Ow!

Version #2 (Reruns)
Narrator: And now, it's time for Patchy's Pick. Hosted by: SpongeBob's number one fan, Patchy the Pirate.
Patchy: [opens the door] Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to Patchy's Pick. Why don't come on back on the galley, I got a little treat for you today. [walks to a red curtain and shows a large cue card with the title "Shanghaied" on it] We're gonna see me favorite show, "Shanghaied"! Ta-da!
Potty: Boring!
Patchy: Well, if it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
Potty: Bawk! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Patchy: Argh... [Potty flies away] Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Where'd you go? [enters something] Potty? You in there, buddy? Potty? Potty?
[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window]
Potty: [laughing and squawking] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Patchy: Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Well, roll the cartoon. [screen fades to black, episode starts]
SpongeBob: (yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward] Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
Squidward: That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
SpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?
Patrick: How about...
Squidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
SpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
Patrick: Clean...
Squidward: [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
SpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!
Patrick: Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
Narrator: A few inches later...
SpongeBob: [points up] Ship!
Patrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
SpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship!
Squidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
Squidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
Squidward: All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says "owner" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
SpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?
Patrick: I don't know. Why?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
Patrick: Yes!
SpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says "property of the Flying Dutchman"]
Flying Dutchman: Rawr!
SpongeBob: No, no, it's not "rawr!"
Flying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob: That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
Flying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
SpongeBob: It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward]
Squidward: I...no, I don't.
SpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
Squidward: [laughs nervously] I never said that.
Flying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
SpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
Squidward: [screams] Ow.
Flying Dutchman: [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back!
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
Squidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?
Patrick: Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: How 'bout now?
Patrick: Uhh...
Squidward: [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: Now listen. [takes out a "Ghost Rule Book"] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
Squidward: Will we be getting business cards?
Flying Dutchman: [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.
Squidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [shows a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick look at Squidward in blank worried faces.]
Flying Dutchman: [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
SpongeBob: No! We know our place now, Mr. Dutchman.
Patrick: We'll do anything you say!
Flying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
Patrick: And I got this hat!
Flying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
SpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
Patrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
SpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
Patrick: I don't get it.
SpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
Flying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
SpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?
Flying Dutchman: Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
Flying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [screams]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
Flying Dutchman: [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [screams]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
[Very long and awkward silence]
Flying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
SpongeBob: Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it slightly to land on a little kid]
Billy: [sing-song voice] I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
Flying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
Patrick: Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
SpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
Flying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
Flying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confused]
SpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
Flying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
Patrick: How does he do that?
Flying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!
Billy: Those guys are dorks.
Flying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
SpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Patrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
SpongeBob: Like movie passes?
Patrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
Flying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
SpongeBob: You're setting us free?
Flying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
Patrick: Wait, I have an idea!
SpongeBob: Really?! What is it?
Patrick: Let's leave!
SpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
Patrick: Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
SpongeBob: I always hate going in there!
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
Flying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
SpongeBob: Never!
Flying Dutchman: Okay, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob, but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No! [Sock begins to tear]
Flying Dutchman: Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
Patrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Flying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
Patrick: Make it five.
Flying Dutchman: Four.
Patrick: Three. Take it or leave it.
Flying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
SpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
Patrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
Flying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]
Squidward: Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [re-appears on the ship]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back!
SpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
Squidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
Patrick: Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
SpongeBob: Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny-meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
Squidward: Hurry, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish that the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house, but you can only see their heads]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Hooray!
SpongeBob: We're home!
Patrick: You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!
Squidward: But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
Flying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. [slices some fruits to the blender] Fruit prevents scurvy! [he whistles as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward scream and bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Ahoy, children! I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls enjoyed the show because it's time for you to walk the plank! [Screen reads: PLEASE STAND BY] Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time for fan mail! [blows horn]
Old-time crowd: Hooray!
Patchy: And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, so get ready to blow milk out of your nose because we're gonna open a letter! [Potty flies to Patchy with the letter. There is a lit fuse on Potty's head] The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant.
Potty: Brawk, you're not welcome.
Patchy: [sniffs the air] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? [notices the fuse] Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
Potty: Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]
Patchy: Well, that's it for Patchy's Pick. Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor and Patchy frowns]

Different endings
There are various endings to "Shanghaied". Differences between each other are the different fates of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, depending on who the Flying Dutchman picked. Below are the different endings:

SpongeBob: [worried] That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
Patrick: Umm...
Squidward: Wait, Patrick. Listen, I do not particularly want to be trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time... [demonstrates the length of eternity as if it were a piece of string. Patrick's eyes look at each end] Understand?
SpongeBob: [rushes in] Patrick, you've got to think harder than you ever thought before.
Patrick: Uhh...
SpongeBob: That's not going to do it! Think harder!
Patrick: [thinks harder] Uhh...
Squidward: [simultaneously with SpongeBob] You can do it! Come on! Put on your thinking cap! Come on!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously with Squidward] Come on, Patrick! Yes, think, think really hard! [Patrick goes really intensely thinking] Yes, Patrick! You're doing good!
Patrick: [his head's toaster ejects bread] Okay! I got it!
Flying Dutchman: Thou wish is granted.
[Gum appears in Patrick's pocket. Patrick eats some gum.]
Patrick: Oh, I'm sorry... Want some gum?
[SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked]
Squidward: You wished for gum?
Patrick: Well, if we're going to be there forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
[SpongeBob and Squidward take a piece of gum each and chews some gum as well]
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward complain in the Flying Dutchman's belly]

Squidward: I wish that I never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Flying Dutchman: So be it. [magically makes SpongeBob and Patrick not know Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hi there. I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob and this is my associate Patrick.
Patrick: Hi.
Squidward: That's not what I meant!
Flying Dutchman: Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner. [grabs out a metal knife and fork]
SpongeBob: [in the Flying Dutchman's belly] And what did you say your name was?

 Patrick: We'll do anything you say!
 Flying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
 SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
 Patrick: And I got this hat!
 Flying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
 SpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
 Patrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
 SpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
 Patrick: I don't get it.
 SpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
 Flying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
 SpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?
 Flying Dutchman: Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
 SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
 Flying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
 SpongeBob: [screams]
 Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
 Flying Dutchman: [howls like a wolf]
 SpongeBob: [screams]
 Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
 [Very long and awkward silence]
 Flying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
 SpongeBob: Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it slightly to land on a little kid]
 Billy: [sing-song voice] I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
 Flying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
 Patrick: Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
 SpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
 Flying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
 Flying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confused]
 SpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
 Flying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
 Patrick: How does he do that?
 Flying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.
 SpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!
 Billy: Those guys are dorks.
 Flying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
 SpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
 Patrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
 SpongeBob: Like movie passes?
 Patrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
 Flying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
 SpongeBob: You're setting us free?
 Flying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
 Patrick: Wait, I have an idea!
 SpongeBob: Really?! What is it?
 Patrick: Let's leave!
 SpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
 Patrick: Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
 SpongeBob: I always hate going in there!
 Patrick: Yeah.
 SpongeBob: [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
 Flying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
 SpongeBob: Never!
 Flying Dutchman: Okay, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob, but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection]Give it to me!
 SpongeBob: No! [Sock begins to tear]
 Flying Dutchman: Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
 Patrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.
 Flying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
 Patrick: Make it five.
 Flying Dutchman: Four.
 Patrick: Three. Take it or leave it.
 Flying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
 SpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
 Patrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
 Flying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]
 SpongeBob: Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]
 Squidward: Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [re-appears on the ship]
 SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back!
 SpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
 Squidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
 Patrick: Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
 SpongeBob: Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
 Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [then one of the above endings.]


SpongeBob: Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time! [Gary's pupils dilate] Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way, [zooms in on Gary's eyes] or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way... [Gary just stares] So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
SpongeBob: Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch! [Throws the ball to Gary. Toy boomerangs back to SpongeBob and he reads the box] Huh? "New" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm. [throws the box but it boomerangs back and hits SpongeBob in the head]
SpongeBob: [with a bomb strapped to his chest] Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath! [Gary doesn't react] Please...? [bomb explodes] I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages!
[pictures of a bathtub, a shower faucet running, and then a bar of soap come up, then a disturbing picture of a giggling girl appears]
Subliminal Girl: [high-pitched laugh]
SpongeBob: Sorry you had to see that. [on the phone] Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath. [person on the other side is talking] What? Can you say that again? [Gary slithers away] Slow down! It's like you're speaking some other language! [hangs up] Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leapfrog? Weehee! Okay, your turn. [flips Gary into the wall and breaks his shell, then we see Gary with his shell bandaged] Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leapfrog? [Gary whacks him on the head with a cane] ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house! [Mr. Krabs comes in taking a bath then takes SpongeBob's dollar] Ya-da-da-da... [stops dancing] That didn't work either, huh? [Gary is sleeping. SpongeBob, who is dressed as a pirate, runs to Gary, who wakes up] Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house! Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure! Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen... [nervously looks at Gary] 40. The treasure must be in here! [opens bathroom door] Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Why, no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub. [Kicks away a paint can] It's treasure! Look, doubloons! [shows 2 bars of soap] Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch! [shows a rubber ducky]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is on SpongeBob] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but he floats over the tub, and appears back on the floor after 2 seconds] Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to... [pulls up Gary off the floor but both end up dangling from the ceiling] Gary, could you... [Gary sucks in one of his eyes into his head and SpongeBob loses his grip] Gary, no! [Gary pulls in other eye] Gary! [SpongeBob falls in the tub]. Alright, Gary, you have duped and/or frustrated me for the last time! So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. [absorbs all the water in the bathtub]. Psst, Gary. Bath delivery! [SpongeBob spits water at Gary but misses and hits the armchair instead]. Come back, Gary! I have something to "chair" with you. [SpongeBob spits more water at Gary but misses and hits dirty dishes, which cleans and stacks them] "Dish" is more like it! "Water" you waiting for, Gary?
Gary: [meowing in a tree]
SpongeBob: Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary! [spits out water at Gary but realizes it's a gramophone playing a record of Gary's meows]. Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin! [Gary, while meowing mockingly, takes the ladder off the tree] Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant! [ladder falls down] I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath and you are going to get clean right now!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I am so the boss of you!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say. [Gary slithers forward] What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister! [Gary stops right next to some mud] Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary The Snail, do you hear me? I am giving you 3 seconds to get away from that mud puddle! 1, [Gary moves closer to the mud] 2, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two and a half... [Gary leans over the mud] don't make me say 3! [Gary leans further over the mud] Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!! [SpongeBob falls out of the tree and into the mud] I'm a dirty boy... [SpongeBob is in the bathtub]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, Gary. [scrubs his ears] I'm getting behind my ears. [Gary grins]


[The Krusty Krab at night. The lights are still on]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob! It's quittin' time! [the lights turn off and Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk out] I've got a card game tonight. [he locks the doors]
SpongeBob: Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs? [we see the Chum Bucket across the street, with its lights still on]
Mr. Krabs: I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton. [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: [Gasps] Plankton?! [a thought bubble appears over SpongeBob's head with Plankton inside] But, Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy! [he picks up a Krabby Patty] He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years! [the Plankton in the thought bubble sees the Krabby Patty and goes to get it, but SpongeBob squishes him with a fly swatter.]
Plankton: Ouch. [the thought bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Why would you play cards with him?
Mr. Krabs: Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom! [cut to him and Plankton holding cards and a giant stack of money on the table] Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years! [Mr. Krabs puts his cards down on the table and rakes in his money with his claws. Back to the present, Mr. Krabs' eyes have turned to dollar signs] I never lose! [the two start laughing and walk off their separate ways. Cut to the morning where Mr. Krabs walks to work crying, and SpongeBob walks in laughing.]
SpongeBob: Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one! [Mr. Krabs leans against the Krusty Krab doors] How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I lost.
SpongeBob: Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?
Mr. Krabs: I didn't lose any money. [he sheds away a tear] I lost...
SpongeBob: Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: I lost... [SpongeBob grabs him]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Mr. Krabs: I lost... [he points to SpongeBob] you!
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: I bet your contract and I lost. [SpongeBob stares blankly, then laughs]
SpongeBob: Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties. [he begins to walk to the door, but Mr. Krabs' claw stops him. After continually walking and getting nowhere, he falls to the floor]
Mr. Krabs: I'm afraid you don't work here anymore. [Squidward runs out the door to the two]
Squidward: Please tell me this isn't a joke.
SpongeBob: Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke. [Plankton walks over]
Plankton: As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking. [he points at SpongeBob] You work for me now, SpongeBob. [he whips out a bucket with the initials "CB" on it] Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet. [he jumps onto SpongeBob's head, kicks off the Krusty Krew hat and puts the bucket on his head. SpongeBob screams and runs to Mr. Krabs while knocking Plankton and the bucket off his head]
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him! [he tugs at Krabs' shirt collar] I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab! [he and Krabs start crying loudly and hug]
Mr. Krabs: I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!
Plankton: [pretending to sound genuinely sad] What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship? [whips out a crowbar] I would! [he jumps up and uses the crowbar to pry SpongeBob off Krabs. SpongeBob goes flying with Mr. Krabs' arms still clung to him]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! [he slams into a cage and Krabs' arms fly off him. Plankton walks over and shuts the door]
Plankton: This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For fifteen years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em! [a propeller emerges from the cage] I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs! [the propeller spins and pilots SpongeBob into the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [he cries] Can I have my arms back? [Plankton walks over and throws the arms on Krabs' head. Cut to the cage hovering over a spotlight and dropping SpongeBob into it]
SpongeBob: What is this place? [the lights turn on and screens with wires and gizmos start starting up. SpongeBob gasps. A giant boiler turns on. SpongeBob yelps. A light turns on and a calendar entitled "Science!" appears and the photo of the month is some nerd in front of a blackboard. SpongeBob screams. Plankton bursts open the doors]
Plankton: Okay, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty! [he walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh...
Plankton: Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now [he jumps onto SpongeBob's knee] and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef! [we see a giant robot that bears a slight resemblance to SpongeBob] So get cooking. [he twangs SpongeBob's nose. Later, SpongeBob is in front of a weird looking grill. He picks up a spatula with a spring end. He puts his fingers to one of the holes in the grill and steam bursts from it. SpongeBob screams. He looks at a digital sign reading "KITCHEN"]
SpongeBob: The sign says "kitchen", but my heart says "jail". ♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪A patty is a patty, that's what I say.♪
SpongeBob: ♪A grill is a grill, this is surely so,♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪And fries should be fries, either way.♪
SpongeBob: ♪But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know.♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪I would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay.♪
Unison: ♪This kitchen's not the same without you.♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪It's just a greasy spoon♪
SpongeBob: ♪It's just a greasy spoon...♪
Unison: ♪...without you.♪ [SpongeBob cries]
Plankton: What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.
Karen: You know that never works! The answer is obvious: to get to the SpongeBob, you must show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give you what you want.
Plankton: Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.
[We see SpongeBob struggling to make a Krabby Patty with one of Plankton's cooking machines]
SpongeBob: [Sound of surprise]
Plankton: Hi!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!
Plankton: Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.
SpongeBob: Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?
SpongeBob: Well, I usually cook on a grill.
Plankton: You got it! [Plankton brings a grill into the Chum Bucket] Well, it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.
Plankton: Say no more, I'll take care of everything. [Plankton pushes the grill] How about here?
SpongeBob: A little more to the left.
Plankton: How's this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Move it over a little more.
Plankton: Here?
SpongeBob: Keep going.
Plankton: Here?
SpongeBob: Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right.
Plankton: [cut to a blindfolded SpongeBob] Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Okay, go ahead, take it off! [he removes the blindfold] It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!
SpongeBob: It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs! [his face turns sad. wailing] Oh...Mr. Krabs!
Plankton: Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?
SpongeBob: Well...there is one thing I've always wanted... [cut to SpongeBob with some fancy vibrating shoes on] Wow!
Plankton: So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: Well... [cut to SpongeBob in a bubble bath, licking green mint ice cream]
Plankton: You ready to make some patties?
SpongeBob: Wait ‘til I finish my ice cream! [cut to SpongeBob riding a toy seahorse, with Plankton pushing him]
Plankton: [while pushing him] How about those patties?
SpongeBob: Faster! Faster! Faster! [cut to Plankton reading to SpongeBob a baby book]
Plankton: And then the littlest sea-elf said... [drool drops on Plankton. SpongeBob is sleeping. He wakes up] Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?
SpongeBob: All this preparation is making me hungry.
Plankton: Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.
Plankton: [laughs] Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?
SpongeBob: [yawning] No, I don't really feel like it!
Plankton: But I don't understand. [SpongeBob drinks soda from a cup] You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair. [loses his cool as he exposes his hands with fumes rising out] I rubbed your putrid feet!
SpongeBob: Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later!
Plankton: [growls in fury] I command you to make me a patty this instant!
SpongeBob: [crossing his arms in refusal] No!
Plankton: Don't back sass me!
SpongeBob: [mocking Plankton] Do ba da ma!
Plankton: What?! [SpongeBob blows a raspberry as he moons at him] That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges. [cut to Plankton outside of a lab] Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants... [to the audience] I put the brain in the robot, you know. [to Robot SpongeBob] You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want. And I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!
Robot SpongeBob: [Beeping] Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response: Why don't you ask me later?
Plankton: [going mad] What? What?!
Robot SpongeBob: Get welded.
Plankton: [pressing the button on the control] Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!
Robot SpongeBob:  [Reads a comic and drinks oil] I don't wanna.
Plankton: [screams out of madness]
Mr. Krabs: [cut to the Krusty Krab] Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter. [holds up an "Out of Business" sign] Huh?
Plankton: [crying] I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.
Mr. Krabs: Um...Well... [taking off the "Out of Business" sign off the doors] a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.
Plankton: Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!
Mr. Krabs: How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands.
Plankton: It's a deal! I cheated anyway.
Mr. Krabs: Now, be gone with you, you puny pest! [Mr. Krabs throws Plankton back inside the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: Thank you! [a crashing sound is heard] Ouch.
SpongeBob: My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!
SpongeBob: [Yawns] I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, Krabby? [laughs; Mr. Krabs glares at him] I mean...I'm working all day for free! My treat! [runs to the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: That's what I thought you said.

French Narrator: Well, well, what is this? Ah, the artist at sea. Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck.
Artist: Hmm... ah! [He kisses his pencil, then he draws some more strokes. He hums something. He accidentally throws his pencil into the sea. It sinks in the water until it's out of sight]
Artist: My pencil! [searches for it in the sea] What? No, no!
French Narrator: The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: Always bring a spare pencil.
Artist: Noooooo! [with a loudly sound. Cut to the pencil dropping into the water. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with bubbles]
SpongeBob: Okay. Ready, Patrick? One...
Patrick: Two...
Both: Three!
[SpongeBob blows a scissors bubble and Patrick blows a paper bubble]
SpongeBob: Scissors beats paper, Patrick! [they both laugh at that] One...
Both: two...
SpongeBob: Three! [both blow paper bubbles] Patrick, how come you always do paper? [the pencil pops the two paper bubbles and drops in the sand and the two scream while running around. They both hide behind the Pineapple away from the pencil.]
Patrick: What is that thing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It looks like a giant pencil!
Patrick: Go touch it!
[SpongeBob extends his arm and touches the pencil]
SpongeBob: It is a giant pencil, Patrick! [SpongeBob grabs the pencil] Let's draw some giant pictures with it.
Patrick: Whatcha drawin'?
SpongeBob: Stand back, Patrick. I can't draw with you breathing down my neck.
Patrick: Psshh, artists.
SpongeBob: It's a jellyfish.
Patrick: Pretty good, SpongeBob, but it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired.
SpongeBob: Eh, everybody's a critic.
[The drawing comes to life and swims away buzzing]
Patrick: SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!
SpongeBob: Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic.
Patrick: No, I mean it's swimming away!
SpongeBob: Do you know what this means, Patrick?
Patrick: Your art can never hang in a museum.
SpongeBob: It means we found a magic pencil!
Patrick: Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Coming right up! [he draws mustache on Patrick's face]
Patrick: Life is good! [the mustache floats away. He shrugs] Easy come, easy go...
Squidward: Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea. You've got looks, talent, all you need is a full head of... [the mustache goes on his head] HAIR!
Patrick: My turn!
SpongeBob: Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such.
Patrick: Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.
SpongeBob: Okay! Why didn't you say so?
[Patrick draws a crudely-drawn picture of Squidward with a small stature and a waving fist.]
SpongeBob: Hey! Another jellyfish!
Patrick: It's Squidward, silly!
[The badly drawn Squidward comes to life and grumbles at them]
SpongeBob: It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.
Patrick: You're right, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: We can't let it go into town! [Patrick erases it]
Patrick: Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hey! My brain just hatched an idea. [he draws a dollar on Squidward's green mat, attached to a string while laughing] This is gonna be classic!
Squidward: [dressed up] I think I fancy a stroll around the park.
SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: [opens door] What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy! [SpongeBob pulls the string] Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair! [it floats away] SpongeBob!
[Squidward goes back inside and slams the door, Patrick and SpongeBob laugh while hopping up and down and suddenly stop]
SpongeBob: Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me! [SpongeBob draws a doodle of himself, Patrick laughs. The drawing stands up] Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie. [Draws it] Ready for action! 
[The SpongeBob doodle shouts nonsense and he runs over to Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Patrick: He's going to the door.
[DoodleBob knocks on the door]
SpongeBob: He's knockin' on the door. Squidward's answering the door... aaaaand...
[DoodleBob picks up Squidward, holding him upside-down and repeatedly pounds his head on the ground]
Squidward: OOH! OWW, OWW, OW!
Patrick: He's beating up Squidward! Ha! Ha! Ha!
[Patrick and SpongeBob watch DoodleBob slam Squidward back and forth]
SpongeBob: DoodleBoy, stop! [DoodleBob throws Squidward back in his house. Then he steals the magic pencil and then runs away with it]
Patrick: He's got the pencil.
SpongeBob: What have I done? We've got to find him!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick in a field with tall bushes] 
SpongeBob: Where could he possibly be?
Patrick: Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.
SpongeBob: Come on, let's go! [Patrick hides in a bush]
Patrick: I'm not going in there [SpongeBob also hides]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there... [DoodleBob draws a hole. They fall into it]
Patrick: What just happened?
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense] Meahoy, memoyay? Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!
Patrick: Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?
SpongeBob: No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him. [a giant wrench falls and hits Patrick on the head]
DoodleBob: Neofineyin!
SpongeBob: See what I mean, Patrick?
Patrick: [dizzily] WHERE'S THE LEAK, MA'AM? [DoodleBob draws a bowling ball and rolls it. Patrick's head turns into a bowling pin in surprise] Yurrgh! [Hits Patrick and some pink bowling pins and a "strike" symbol appears. Another "strike" symbol then appears after the bowling ball falls into the hole]
SpongeBob: You okay, Patrick?
Patrick: FINLAND!
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense and more nonsense] Meyaiovah! Mee hoy minoy! Meah froyay! [he runs off in the distance, Bubble transition to a coral rock wall and a field]
SpongeBob: There he is.
Patrick: He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie! [SpongeBob looks down at his own clothes]
SpongeBob: Uh... *ahem*.
Patrick: [blushes] Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob. Heh heh!
SpongeBob: He's putting down the pencil. This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him.
Patrick: Ooh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?
[DoodleBob breaks through the coral rock wall where SpongeBob and Patrick are hiding behind.]
DoodleBob: [nonsense] Bawahh bwah bwah wahh! [DoodleBob grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick!! Patrick! Do something!
Patrick: Happy Birthday!
[DoodleBob throws SpongeBob, who screams and lands with a thud in the distance]
Patrick: [Gives DoodleBob a rock] Here's your present. [DoodleBob bashes it on his head] You're welcome.
DoodleBob: [nonsense] Dewaaagheaugaaagh! [DoodleBob was about to run for his life until SpongeBob stops him whilst holding the pencil in his face]
SpongeBob: Hold it right there, Doodle! I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense fast] EEDAHFAAWAHOBABOBBA!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, what was that?
DoodleBob: [Slowing gibberish down] Ee...DAh...Faawa...HobaBobba... [DoodleBob starts to shout more gibberish while SpongeBob erases his face. DoodleBob mutters, then he hits a rock]
SpongeBob: Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good. [begins to erase DoodleBob to oblivion] Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...! [he screams in victory] I AM SPONGEBOB, DESTROYER OF EVIL!
Patrick: Take it easy. It's just a drawing.
SpongeBob: [calmly] Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?
Patrick: Done and done.
[When SpongeBob and Patrick go home, it is soon revealed that one of DoodleBob's arms is still alive. It creeps out from under the rock. Cut to nighttime. SpongeBob had just returned home. He draws on the spaces of his bedroom to make it look like a fancy bedroom, complete with a canopy for his bed.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince.
Gary: [with a crown on] Meeeoowww.
SpongeBob: Good night, magic pencil. [Falls asleep. DoodleBob's arm goes into SpongeBob's house, it starts going up the stairs and takes a bathroom break, finally he sneaks up to SpongeBob's bed, grabs the pencil, and starts to re-draw himself. He wakes up] Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water? [laughs] [DoodleBob pops up in his bed] AAAAH! DOODLEBOB! Heh heh, no hard feelings, right? [DoodleBob draws two angry eyebrows on his face and jumps on SpongeBob's bed holding the pencil threateningly] [screams] What do you think you're doing, doodle?!
DoodleBob: You Doodle! Me SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams and jump out of the ways as DoodleBob erases his pillow, then part of SpongeBob's house whilst chasing him, they chase downstairs. DoodleBob erases a door and the back of SpongeBob's pants, revealing his butt] Huh? [Erases his butt]
SpongeBob: [screams] Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen? [DoodleBob erases his nose] I nose. [DoodleBob erases some parts of his face and body, DoodleBob laughs at the way he looks now] Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn. [When SpongeBob and DoodleBob struggle, the pencil breaks into two. SpongeBob has the lead and draws the rest of his face and body back] Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw. [DoodleBob sharpens the pencil with his mouth. He now has both sides] You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school. [the lead piece flies out of his hand, crashes through the window and hits Squidward]
Squidward: [offscreen] Ow! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!
SpongeBob: Or maybe it was most clumsy. [DoodleBob starts to attack him again as SpongeBob hides in a bookshelf, as DoodleBob approaches him, he gets his foot stuck in a piece of paper on the floor, DoodleBob sees this and tries to get it off] Huh? [SpongeBob looks in a book] Paper! [DoodleBob tosses the pencil from his hand] Page for Mr. Doodle! [Smashes him with a notebook. SpongeBob watches as DoodleBob is preserved as a drawing, when it was all over, he smiles. The next day, SpongeBob hangs the piece of paper on the wall with a push-pin]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?
SpongeBob: Take a look for yourself, Patrick.
Patrick: [Gasp!] It's the evil Doodle!
SpongeBob: No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose. [he blows from a pipe]
Patrick: So... he's a drawing?
SpongeBob: Exactly! See how happy he is?
Patrick: [He looks at the paper with DoodleBob on it] He still looks kind of creepy.
[Cut to outside. SpongeBob has just drawn a diving board. The pencil's broken halves have recently been taped together.]
SpongeBob: Oh, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?
Patrick: Ready! [SpongeBob drops the pencil into Patrick's mouth. SpongeBob jumps from the diving board and onto Patrick's chest, and the pencil is launched back to the surface. In the real world, the artist from earlier is curled up in a fetal position]
French Narrator: We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.
Artist: [the pencil reaches the surface and lands on him] Huh? What's this? [he jumps up and holds his pencil in joy] My pencil! [he tries to draw, but unfortunately, the pencil lead breaks]
French Narrator: [As the artist starts to cry] The second most important rule for the artist at sea: Always bring a pencil sharpener.
Artist: NOOOOO!!!



SpongeBob: [as he runs to Patrick's rock] Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing? [Patrick comes out of his rock with a box, doing an acrobatic trick]
Patrick: Oh, boy, am I!
SpongeBob: Here's your net. [Patrick glances at his box] Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.
Patrick: First, I have to put away my secret box.
SpongeBob: Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box! [SpongeBob tries to peek in the box, but Patrick pulls it away]
Patrick: Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh! [opens the box, laughs at it, and shuts it as SpongeBob tries to peek it] Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life! [SpongeBob gets behind Patrick to see what's inside the box, but Patrick holds it to himself]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.
Patrick: You do?
SpongeBob: I've got a gazillion secrets!
Patrick: Like what?
SpongeBob: Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly. [Patrick drools as the top of his head has lightning bolts coming out of it, showing that he couldn't understand the whole sentence]
SpongeBob: You wanna hear one of my secrets?
Patrick: Do I?
SpongeBob: Uhh... Let's see... [he runs up to Patrick] Did you know that you're my best friend? [he runs away]
Patrick: No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!
SpongeBob: Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve.
Patrick: Wow! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh. [SpongeBob clears his throat and taps on Patrick's box] Tell me some more secrets!
SpongeBob: Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think jellyfishing and bubble-blowing are the... [transition to SpongeBob still telling secrets as Patrick lays his head on the box] ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word "fancy" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now. [he shows his three pairs of underwear to Patrick]
Patrick: Gasp. I never would have guessed.
SpongeBob: Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. [Patrick imagines a carton of milk spilling itself]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh… [close-up of SpongeBob's socks] I've got my secret socks on. [he runs away and comes back with Gary's bowl] And my secret Gary's bowl! [he runs away then comes back, pulling his television] My secret TV! [turns on the TV] And my secret TV channel. [the TV shows an off-air color bars screen] What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: [he giggles, then laughs loudly after a gander at the box and then stops to breathe. He looks again and laughs harder and wildly. He stops to breathe] Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret. [he shows the box to SpongeBob] Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the mystery of the box. [SpongeBob tries to peek inside the box, but Patrick slams it shut] Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house. [scene zooms out to show Squidward's Tiki Head home looking down at SpongeBob and Patrick, who notice the looks before it goes back to normal] It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna… [gasps when he finds out his box is gone, The scene cuts to a laughing SpongeBob running with Patrick's secret box, but then he bumps into Patrick's belly] SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!
SpongeBob: [Struggles with Patrick on the box] But, Patrick, I must know the secret!
Patrick: [Struggles with SpongeBob on the box] For the last time, SpongeBob, no!
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, just a peek?
Patrick: Never! [SpongeBob and Patrick strain as they fight over the box. Eventually, SpongeBob's arms pop off and he gasps] So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club! [he shows his finger with the ring on it and then the camera zooms in on the ring. He grabs one of SpongeBob's arms and points it at SpongeBob] Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants! [as he pokes SpongeBob's nose with his arm] If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!
SpongeBob: But... we're supposed to be... [his eyes get big and sad] friends forever. [flashback to SpongeBob and Patrick as babies in a crib laughing, then we see them as kids riding on a bike, then as they are now, riding a bike, then as older men in rocking chairs, then we see a shot of two gravestones with their names and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick still laughing, but they are buried. The flashback ends.] I feel so filthy! [he starts to cry] I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself! [he jumps on Patrick] I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!
Patrick: Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever? [we see a close-up of Patrick's box] The most amazing... [as he sticks the box in SpongeBob's eyes, the eyes pop out of him and then back in] mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom. [he eyes are glued to the box for a moment, and then goes back to him]
SpongeBob: So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?
Patrick: Friends. [they shake hands. Cuts to a night view of SpongeBob's house, then inside as SpongeBob talks]
SpongeBob: What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish! [he slides down in his bed] Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds. [he sits up] Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box. [he hides himself in the blanket and shivers] Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party! [screams, then jumps onto the bedroom window and talks a little muffled] I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do! [SpongeBob's face pops off and sticks onto his back] That's it! How do you look in a secret box? [he jumps off the window] Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back. [he turns around to show only his nose. He turns back around] Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary? [Gary narrows his eyes]
Gary: Meeh… No. [cut to the outside]
SpongeBob: Oh, what do you know? You're a snail! [SpongeBob sneaks over to Patrick's house, puts gloves and a ski mask on him, crawls up the rock with his back, and tears him in half and gets both halves under the rock. He then lands and notices Patrick. He then screams gibberish, drools and SpongeBob hides behind the portrait of SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob then peeks and then the wall starts to crack. Patrick mumbles, the wall breaks even more and then the nail falls off. He then grabs the nail with his foot and puts it back.]
Patrick: [as the camera zooms in on the box] Seee... cret.
SpongeBob: [thinking] I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up. [slides down the wall from the portrait and makes a loud noise upon touching the floor. Patrick stretches and then goes back to sleep. SpongeBob then lifts his leg and then Patrick makes another noise. He then tosses himself over on the bed. SpongeBob puts his leg down, which makes a loud noise]
Patrick: Duh... who's there? [he mumbles then goes back to sleep.]
SpongeBob: [talking to his foot] Shhh! [SpongeBob steps on a potato chip and makes a broken glass sound]
Patrick: Eh?! [gibberish] Who's that?! [Patrick is back asleep. SpongeBob sweeps his sweat drops off him and they land, causing a loud splash sound.] Mmm... water. [he licks his mouth dry, then tosses himself on the bed. SpongeBob takes another step and makes an "AWOOOOGA!" noise. He then steps again, making a loud machine gun noise. Steps again, making the sound of an elephant. He then stretches his leg near the side of the bed, then takes the step, making a very loud crashing noise. He then peeks above Patrick to see the box. He gets ready to reach for the box, but Patrick takes the box before SpongeBob could grab it. He then slides onto Patrick, grabbing the box] Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside. [opens SpongeBob's mouth and pulls out his tongue, then laughs. He lets go of his tongue] Nighty-night, boxie. [he puts SpongeBob on the side of the bed. SpongeBob gets off the bed and then trips on a shoestring, causing him to bounce around Patrick's house, making a lot of loud noises until his head hits the wall, causing the portrait to fall off the wall, hitting him in the head, breaking the portrait half. The box then lands on SpongeBob and makes a loud noise. The scene cuts back to Patrick, who, despite all the noise, continues to sleep]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. [Patrick wakes up]
Patrick: Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!
SpongeBob: Uh…
Patrick: It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box! [he runs up to SpongeBob] Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life! [he readies his pillow like a shotgun ready to suffocate him]
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! [takes off his mask] It's me, SpongeBob!
Patrick: [stares at him while clueless] Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me.
SpongeBob: No, really, Patrick! Look! [Patrick gasps. SpongeBob presses a button on the ring]
SpongeBob and Patrick BFF Ring: It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!
Patrick: Our friendship ring! It is you! [crying as he covers his face with his pillow] How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!?
SpongeBob: If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside. [he throws the pillow away and snatches the box out of SpongeBob's hands]
Patrick: [with a tear coming out of his eye] That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is over!
SpongeBob: [gasps and tears up] Really?
Patrick: Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to.
SpongeBob: Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes! [he lifts the lid off the box] Huh?
Patrick: Well, didn't I tell ya? [we see a string inside the box] Isn't it great?
SpongeBob: It's just a string.
Patrick: A secret string!
SpongeBob: Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that! [he puts the lid back on the box] Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!
Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob pops out of Patrick's house]
SpongeBob: I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along! [he laughs] Wait 'till I tell Gary!
Patrick: [laughs menacingly] Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the... [a secret compartment opens] ...secret compartment of my secret box... [he takes out a photo] ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party! [cut to the Bikini Atoll] Merry Christmas, SpongeBob! [laughs as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]


Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about...
Squidward: [talks cheerfully as he switches the "Open" sign to "Closed"] Now! 8:00! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is: [pulls out his clarinet] Clarinet. [Tom shows up at the door and knocks on it, causing Squidward to drop his clarinet] What?
Tom: Are you open?
Squidward: [points to the sign] Read the sign.
Tom: [ignores him] I'll have a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a Double Chili Kelp Fries.
Squidward: NO, YOU WON'T. I can't hang out here all night. I've got a life!
Tom: Well, fine, if you don't want my money!
Mr. Krabs: [says cheerfully] Money?! [Mr. Krabs then falls from the ceiling on top of Squidward] You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?
Tom: [pulls out cash; Sadie, an anchovy, and an old man appear behind him] Sure!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, [tears up the "Closed" sign] welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day.
Squidward: What!? [crowd of fish barge in cheering]
SpongeBob: Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life. [leaves]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working! [gasps] It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease! [jumps on cash register counter] Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
Squidward: [Sandals walks up to counter; Squidward hands him a baseball bat] Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.
SpongeBob: Pst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen [laughs] at night!
Squidward: [takes hat off; leans head on counter] Don't hold back.
SpongeBob: [cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen] Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob in the bathroom wiping it clean with himself] Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob at the grill picking up spatula, misses the spatula and hits the grill; screams] I burned my hand!...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob walking on the counter, singing to the tune of Charge] Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! NIGHT!
Squidward: WILL YOU PLEASE?! Here, [hands SpongeBob a bag of garbage] give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!
SpongeBob: All right! [takes bag from Squidward] Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night. [stops at the door] You mean outside?
Squidward: That's where the dumpster is, yes.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward, [leans face against window] it's kinda dark out there.
Squidward: But I thought you liked the night shift.
SpongeBob: You're right! [lifts bag over his head] FOR THE KRUSTY KRAB! [runs out of the building to the dumpster, panicking the whole way] AHHHHHaahhAAAhhhhhhAahhaAAAAAAHHHaaaAaaAAaAhhhhAAhhahahAAHh! [reenters the building panting heavily. He confidently snaps his fingers] Piece of cake.
Squidward: So you're not afraid?
SpongeBob: Pfft, nah.
Squidward: Well I am. Especially after, [looks around, gulps] well, you know.
SpongeBob: [turns around] What? What do I know?
Squidward: You don't remember? It was all over the news.
SpongeBob: Tell me, tell me!
Squidward: No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you. [gives a sympathetic look, then smiles slyly]
SpongeBob: [excitedly] What happened, what happened, what happened!?
Squidward: You mean you've never heard the story of the [thinks] "Hash-Slinging Slasher?"
SpongeBob: The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
SpongeBob: The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, [a boring-looked Squidward frowns] The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.
Squidward: Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha---[breaks into scream] because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!
SpongeBob: [begging] Tell me the story!
Squidward: Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.
SpongeBob: He forgot the secret sauce?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: He didn't wash his hands?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Irregular portions?
Squidward: No!! He cut off his own hand by mistake!
SpongeBob: You mean like this? [pulls one of his arms out of socket, another one grows back in its place] Or like this? [pulls it again, another one grows back] Or this? [does it again] Or this? [does it again] But what about this! Or this, or this, or this, or...
Squidward: [interrupts] Except he wasn't a sponge.
SpongeBob: [ask with all his extra hands creating a rainbow-like line] So?
Squidward: So it didn't grow back!
SpongeBob: [screams] OH, NO!!! [all his extra arms lift their hands upwards and run away]
Squidward: And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?
SpongeBob: Tuesday.
Squidward: Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.
SpongeBob: [gasps] But tonight's Tuesday night!
Squidward: Then he'll be coming.
SpongeBob: How will we know?
Squidward: There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First: the lights will flicker on and off. Next...
Harold: [interrupts] Dude, can I have some ketchup?
Squidward: Oh, here you go. [hands him ketchup] Next: the phone will ring and there will be nobody there. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails] And finally: the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails, starts eating his arms, the arms regrow and he eats those and then he eats his arms like popcorn] Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead! [SpongeBob begins eating his hands like popcorn] Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand...
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: He opens the door... [pushes his tentacle to SpongeBob's face, making it looking like he's a door that's being opened; while doing this he imitates the sound of a squeaky door opening. leans towards SpongeBob's face, which sinks in] ...he slowly approaches the counter! ["counter" echoes menacingly] And you know what he does next?
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: You really want to know?
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Are you sure you want to know?
SpongeBob: WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DOES HE DO?!?!
Squidward: [sneaks up on SpongeBob, taps him] He gets ya! [SpongeBob now screams repeatedly for about 20 seconds while Squidward is laughing] SpongeBob... [continues screaming] SpongeBob I wa... [screaming continues] I was ju... [SpongeBob's pupils are now screaming too] I was jus... [screaming continues] SPONGEBOB, I WAS JOKING!!
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: It's not true! None of it's true!
SpongeBob: It's not?
Squidward: Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.
SpongeBob: Ohhhhh... [laughs repeatedly like he did with screaming. Cuts into later in the night. Shows Krusty Krab with a big sign that says 'Open Forever']
[Squidward is shown at the counter reading a book. Squidward hears spooky noises and feels water dripping on him but he doesn't know what it is.]
SpongeBob: [on the ceiling wearing suction cups cleaning] Isn't this great, Squidward? [Squidward screams] There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.
Squidward: [says to himself] Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?
[cuts to Patrick's bedroom]
Patrick: [Patrick's alarm clock goes off] Oh, boy! Three A.M.! [whips out a Krabby Patty and starts to eat it; cuts back to The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here! [lights start to flicker on and off] Very funny, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: "And the lights will flicker on and off," just like the story. I get it. [realizes no one is flickering the light switch and looks shocked]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?
Squidward: I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day! [phone rings, Squidward picks it up] What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: [walks up to the counter] Nice try, Squidward.
Squidward: Nice try, what?
SpongeBob: "The phone will ring and there will be no one there." [raises eyebrows up and down and giggles] Oh, you crack me up.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm not doing this. [hangs up phone] Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights, [lights flicker on and off] and the phone, [phone rings] ...and the walls will ooze green slime?!?! [walls start to ooze green slime] Oh, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing? [hears a motor, turns his head and opens his eyes wide; a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab doors]
SpongeBob: [walks up to the counter] I didn't know the buses ran this late. 
Squidward: They don't! [a man gets out of the bus and the bus pulls away, all Squidward and SpongeBob can see is his spooky outline]
SpongeBob: Well, they're dropping someone off. [from the outside, the man lifts his spatula]
Squidward: [screams to the point where hair grows from his head and starts wiggling] The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...
SpongeBob: The Hash-Slinging Slasher! [starts to cry]
Squidward: At last you understand! We're doomed!
SpongeBob: No, that's not it. [wipes tear] I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me. You must really like me! [cries again]
Squidward: SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One: I hate you. And two: how can that be me when I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE!? [the man taps on the door with his spatula]
SpongeBob:  [screams to the point where his eyelashes grow and start wiggling]
SpongeBob and Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!!!! [the guy walks in the door and up to the counter]
SpongeBob: [Squidward screams] He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!
Squidward: SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!
SpongeBob: Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!
Squidward: Huh? [a nerdy unnamed guy reaches the counter]
SpongeBob: Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!
Richard: Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula. [holds up spatula] I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.
SpongeBob: Do you have references?
Squidward: Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights? [lights flicker on and off; SpongeBob, Squidward, and Richard look over to see a vampire flicking the light switch]
SpongeBob, Squidward and Richard: [playfully] Nosferatu!
Nosferatu: [smiles, light turns off]


[The exterior of the Krusty Krab is shown.]
Mr. Krabs: [Off-Screen] Da da dee. [Mr. Krabs is shown in his office. He is stitching.] Stitch one purl two. da da dee doo. [The scene shows that he is stitching a pattern of a dollar bill.] Da day dee da. Dee doh.. [He abruptly stops and sniffs the air.] What's that smell? [He runs over to the cashier boat.] The register! [He shakes the register and smells it.] $49.0... 8?! That's a penny short! [He starts crying.]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, no. Not a penny. Help! Somebody, help us.
[SpongeBob slides up from the floor of the boat.]
SpongeBob: It's just a penny, sir. [Mr. Krabs stops crying. SpongeBob jumps out of the boat.] It doesn't matter.
Mr. Krabs: Doesn't matter? It's money that makes the world go round, boy! It's money that keeps your [He holds up a right-angled ruler to SpongeBob's pants.] pants square! It's money that keeps Squidward in frilly soap!
[The scene cuts to Squidward in the Dining area sniffing the air.]
Squidward: Lilac!
[The scene cuts to show the Krusty Krab with numerous large bandages on it.]
Mr. Krabs: It's money that paid for all them renovations we did! Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that... [Something catches his eye] Hmm? ...scrumptious, curvy cutie.
SpongeBob: I see her, Mr. Krabs. [The scene cuts to a Krabby Patty on a tray, next to a soda.] A Krabby Patty with cheese. [A pair of flippers grabs the sandwich. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs.] The classic.
Mr. Krabs: Not the sandwich, boy. The curvy cutie holding the sandwich.
[The scene cuts to Mrs. Puff eating the Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] Hey! [On-Screen] that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!
Mr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff? Aw, she's married.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single.
Mr. Krabs: Then what happened to Mr. Puff?
[The scene cuts to Mr. Puff, who is now a lamp, being turned on. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: She doesn't like to talk about it.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a lass like that on me claw.
SpongeBob: Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, I, I'm, I'm too old, boy. Too hard-shelled for love. Besides, I ain't not properly dressed.
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Mr. Krabs! [The scene cuts to a close-up of his clothes, which are messy.] You look great. [The scene cuts back to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.] You wait here while I go break the ice.
[SpongeBob quickly runs off.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooh!
[It cuts to a wide shot of Mrs. Puff.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
[Mrs. Puff screams.]
Mrs. Puff: Hit the brakes, SpongeBob! Watch that tree! Left! Left!
SpongeBob: [He snaps his fingers.] Wait, Mrs. Puff! We're not driving.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't expect to see you here.
SpongeBob: I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss?
Mrs. Puff: Well, I'm not...
SpongeBob: Don't move!
[SpongeBob runs back to Mr. Krabs.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
SpongeBob: [While dragging Mr. Krabs to the table] Mrs. Puff, [The two stop.] I'd like to introduce you to Mr... [Mr. Krabs falls forward onto the floor. SpongeBob props him back up.] Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs.
Mrs. Puff: [Nervously] Uh, hello.
[Mr. Krabs quivers.]
SpongeBob: Psst! Mr. Krabs, say hello. [Mr. Krabs nervously mutters.] No, no, Mr. Krabs. Just say hello.
[Mr. Krabs performs a strangled groan.]
Mrs. Puff: Hmm, perhaps another time would be...
Mr. Krabs: [As Mrs. Puff is starting to leave, Mr. Krabs yelling at SpongeBob] No!
SpongeBob: Wait. [As Mrs. Puff sits back down and shivering] He's trying to tell you something.
Mrs. Puff: [Shivering] Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs jerks his eyes and moving his arms around weirdly, while speaking gibberish.] I don't understand.
[Mr. Krabs looks at SpongeBob and speaks gibberish to him.]
SpongeBob: [While Mr. Krabs is speaking gibberish] Oh! I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to... [Mr. Krabs stops speaking gibberish and turns around.] ...hit you with a rake!
Mrs. Puff: [Scared] Goodness!
Mr. Krabs: No!
[Mr. Krabs lifts his tall eyes up and down, while Speaking gibberish.]
SpongeBob: Try to guess your weight.
Mrs. Puff: [Offended] Well!
[Mr. Krabs flails his arms, while speaking gibberish.]
SpongeBob: [While Mr. Krabs is speaking gibberish] No, wait. He wants to take you... [thinks for a second] ...on a date!
[Mr. Krabs gasps happily and falls over]
Mrs. Puff: Is that true, Mr. Krabs? Do you want to take me on a date?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. What do you say?
Mrs. Puff: What do I say? [starts laughing] I say, you have a way with words, Mr. Krabs.
[Mrs. Puff walks away.]
Mr. Krabs: I still got it. [chuckles]
[The bubble transition goes to the exterior of the Krabs' house at night.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] Ready for your date, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [Off-screen] I'm always ready when it comes to datin', lad!
[The interior of the Krabs' Anchor is shown.]
SpongeBob: [While he is holding a list, and Mr. Krabs, who is wearing fancy clothes, walk down stairs] Breath spray?
Mr. Krabs: [sprays mouth with breath spray] Check.
SpongeBob: Lucky hanky?
Mr. Krabs: [He takes out his hanky.] Check.
SpongeBob: Giant rusty anchor?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, anchor. Anchor? I can't find me giant rusty anchor!
[SpongeBob throws the list away and laughs]
SpongeBob: Relax, Mr. Krabs. [While opening the door.] Just a little joke. [While making a circle in the air with his hands.] Good luck with you know who.
[SpongeBob moves his eyebrows up and down.]
Mr. Krabs: Who's that?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah. Well, wish me luck, lad!
[The bubble transition goes to the exterior of Fancy!]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen] Oh, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff are shown at a table inside.] This dinner has been so wonderful. The coral was cooked to perfection. [giggles] I don't think I could eat another bite.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I doubt that, my little shrimp boat.
[Mrs. Puff giggles.]
Mrs. Puff: You're spoiling me, Mr. Krabs. I mean, [The scene shows a squid rubbing Mrs. Puff's feet.] foot rubs between courses. [While pulling out a caricature of herself.] Caricatures. Imported music. [The scene swift pans to a live-action scuba diver plays the piano on the other side of the room. The scene shows Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing's too good for you, my prickly peach.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, what I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Krabs, is...
Waiter: Uh, sir, your fancy pantsy limousine is here.
Mr. Krabs: Wonderful! Pufflily-poo, your chariot awaits!
Mrs. Puff: Well...
[Mr. Krabs whistles and two men join the waiter in carrying a screaming Mrs. Puff away.]
Mr. Krabs: You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib.
[He sighs as the waiter approaches him again.]
Waiter: Your bill, sir.
[Mr. Krabs takes the bill.]
Mr. Krabs:  What? [it shows the bill] $100?! Well, this can't possibly be correct!
Waiter: Oh, my mistake, sir. Thank you for pointing that out. [he hands Mr. Krabs a different bill] This is your bill.
[Mr. Krabs takes the bill. Looks down and his eyes enlarge, oddly. The exterior of the restaurant is shown and the cork flies off. The scream shatters the glass bottle, which causes the sign to go flying and the valet fall over. The bubble transitions shows the Krabs' anchor at night. It then cuts to the interior and Mr. Krabs, who is back in his normal clothes, crying on the floor. SpongeBob is also there.]
SpongeBob: I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night?
[Mr. Krabs gets up.]
Mr. Krabs: [Still crying] Oh, SpongeBob! I couldn't help but spend every cent I had on her! I couldn't control myself!
SpongeBob: What are you gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know, boy! I've got another date tomorrow! I'm caught in the middle of me two great loves! Sweet Mrs. Puff, and the rest of me money!
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs is crying] I wish there was some way I could help.
[Mr. Krabs stops crying.]
Mr. Krabs: Perhaps there is, boy! [hands SpongeBob his wallet] I'm puttin' you in charge of me money.
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You come with me on the date and don't let me spend any money. [The bubble transition shows Mrs. Puff's house. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk up to it.] Now remember, we keep it cheap by going to the park. And no matter how much I ask you, you don't give me any of me money. Now give me a dollar.
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Good boy! You'll do fine.
[Mr. Krabs knocks on the door.]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen; singingly] Who is it?
Mr. Krabs: It's me, [Mr. Krabs' pupils turn into hearts.] my beautiful bell buoy!
[Mrs. Puff is heard giggling.]
Mrs. Puff: Just a minute!
[Mr. Krabs pupils turn back to normal.]
Mr. Krabs: Flowers! Flowers, boy! Go get flowers!
SpongeBob: But you said...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't call on a classy lady like Mrs. Puff empty-handed. We ain't talking about this... [He makes a square in the air.] ...or this... [He makes a triangle in the air.] ...we're talking about this!
[Mr. Krabs makes the circle in the air.]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen] Almost ready.
Mr. Krabs: Hurry, boy! Get the flowers!
[SpongeBob runs off as Mrs. Puff opens her door.]
Mr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff. You're as beautiful as ever.
[Mrs. Puff sighs.]
Mrs. Puff: That's funny. I thought I heard SpongeBob's voice.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, e-excuse me. I have to call my insurance agent.
[Mrs. Puff hurries back inside]
Mr. Krabs: Of course, my beautiful Puff.
[Mr. Krabs sighs and his pupils turn to hearts again.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen; making the heart pupils go away] Mr. Krabs, [While walking to give Mr. Krabs the flowers.] I got the flowers you wanted me to buy.
Mr. Krabs: [While turning around.] What's that?
SpongeBob: I got the flowers for Mrs. Puff.
Mr. Krabs: We had an agreement, boy. You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!
SpongeBob: But you said...
Mrs. Puff: [As Mr. Krabs' pupils turn to hearts again] Here I come!
Mr. Krabs: [while Mrs. Puff opens the door and he grabs the flowers] For you, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, [as she is grabbing the flowers] flowers. Oh, how thoughtful!
Mr. Krabs: [While he holds out an empty claw] And here's a box of chocolates. [He turns back to SpongeBob.] SpongeBob, where's the chocolates?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't go to Mrs. Puff's house without chocolates. Hurry! Hurry!
[SpongeBob runs off. SpongeBob comes back with the heart-shaped box of chocolates]
SpongeBob: [As Mr. Krabs' pupil return to normal] I bought the biggest box they had!
Mr. Krabs: Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!
Mrs. Puff: [As Mr. Krabs' pupils turn back into hearts] Oh, Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: [As he offer Mrs. Puff the box of chocolates] Here's those chocolates I bought for you. What are we doing today, Mrs. Puff? Dinner? Dancing? A trip to the moon?
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs' eyes turn back to normal] Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?
Mrs. Puff: Actually, a walk in the park sounds perfect. It's a beautiful day. I'll just need to get a sun hat and...
Mr. Krabs: [While his pupils turn back into hearts] Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, I think she...
Mr. Krabs: The sun is beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head.
SpongeBob: As your financial advisor, I suggest...
Mr. Krabs: [his eyes are back to normal] There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!
[SpongeBob starts to leave, but comes back.]
SpongeBob: But...
Mr. Krabs: Today! [SpongeBob runs off and Mrs. Puff puts her fins over her mouth.] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll [He takes out a barrel.] shade ya! [He places the barrel on Mrs. Puff's head.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, hurry!
SpongeBob: [as he comes back from the store with a large straw hat] One shady hat.
Mr. Krabs: Good job, lad. 
[Mr. Krabs puts the hat on Mrs. Puff.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, well, thank you, but you didn't need to buy one. I have a hat in the closet.
Mr. Krabs: Didn't need to buy one? [He turns his head around like an owl to face SpongeBob, still grinning] You hear that, boy? [in high pitch] We didn't need to buy a hat. [angrily] Aren't you supposed to be saving me money?!
SpongeBob: I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!
Narrator: A few moments later...
Mr. Krabs: [happily as hearts float in the background] SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat! [After SpongeBob buys one, Krabs is mad and flaming dollars float in the background]
Mr. Krabs: You're spending all me money! [happily] Puffy needs a new pair of shoes! [SpongeBob gets the shoes]
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] You're breaking me, boy! [happily] She needs fine jewelry! [SpongeBob gets the jewelry] Not that fine! [SpongeBob runs back and forth, speeding up, carrying various items as Mr. Krabs keeps yelling his name. He eventually becomes too tired to move] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a pink umbrella] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a bicycle] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a purple surfboard] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a grandfather clock] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with an anchor barbell] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a TV] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back and forth with lots of presents] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
[his voice echoes, and SpongeBob is seen sitting on the ground, his arms stretched, and he is panting]
Mr. Krabs: [runs up, his eyes are shaped like hearts] SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff...
SpongeBob: Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say, [stretches out his eyeballs, imitating Mr. Krabs] "Arrgh, SpongeBob! Yer spending all me money!" And then I'll say, "But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!" Then you'll say, "We're not talking about this..." [Makes the triangle] ..."Or this"... [Makes the square] ..."we're talking about this!" [He squiggles all over the screen. The screen fades out for a moment. Fades back in to see SpongeBob panting with Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: But, lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this! [Cut to Mrs. Puff who has many unneeded, expensive items surrounding her]
Mrs. Puff: Are we going to the park soon?
Mr. Krabs: Please, lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her! [Starts to cry]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Okay, I, I'm going to get it, see? [Walks off-screen, and comes back with a washing machine] Cheer up, Mr. Krabs, Here's that washing machine you wanted.
Mr. Krabs: Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!
SpongeBob: See?! You just did it again!
Mr. Krabs: Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money. [SpongeBob gets a blank expression on his face] Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think? [screams] Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet! [During SpongeBob's rage, Mrs. Puff looks up these words in the dictionary that Mr. Krabs bought her, and gasps and blushes. SpongeBob angrily walks past Mrs. Puff while muttering, and Mr. Krabs' mouth is agape]
Mrs. Puff: I didn't know SpongeBob had such a colorful vocabulary. Actually, there's something I'd like to say, too, Mr. Krabs. [Takes off her fur coat, shoes and hat] I'm afraid I just don't feel comfortable accepting all these gifts. I'd rather go Dutch, if you don't mind. [Hands him some money from her purse]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, okay.
Mrs. Puff: You're a very sweet man, Mr. Krabs. [Mrs. Puff kisses him and his eyes bend into the shape of a heart]
Mr. Krabs: [as his eyes make a heart] Aawww...


Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. [class groans]
SpongeBob: [leans towards Nat] Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
Mrs. Puff: Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight. [class groans again]
SpongeBob: [Again leaning towards Nat] Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
Mrs. Puff: In no less than 800 words. [squeals and class groans again]
Nat: [acting like SpongeBob] Did you hear that? 800 words!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I know! [Nat frowns]
Mrs. Puff: Due tomorrow. And remember class: work hard and no goofing off.
[back at SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is [holds up a pencil] the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm... funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. [kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it] Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. [looks at window, it's colorful outside] Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! [SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and has still only written 8 words] Gee, this is harder than I thought... [SpongeBob looks outside where everyone is having fun]
Patrick: [applies lotion on Sandy] Come on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob goes back to his desk]
SpongeBob: It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! [a live-action drag race is shown. a car hits a wall, tumbles and gets back up] Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only 6 o'clock. Okay, okay here we go, here we go. [struggles to write] I know, I just need to get blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? [SpongeBob does calisthenics. While doing it, he recites "Hup Hoo" several times, his nose and eyelashes do it too.]
SpongeBob:  I can feel those juices pumpin' now! [moves his chair closer to the table. he does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs] Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! [pushes his chair in] Come on, pencil, make words.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How’s my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What do you mean you're not hungry?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary. [Grabs Gary by his shell and pours some food he takes up a ladder and fills it to ceiling-level] I've got to make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite. [Gary quickly eats it] Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? [steps on Gary's food] Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. [cleans it up using himself as a mop] Hmmm... I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. [cut to SpongeBob, who has already finished] Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long... and it's only... 10 o'clock?! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written! [Begins active writing] I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah... yeah... yeah! And some of these, and some of these... Almost there and... [finishes writing. The pencil is steaming due to the excess force] done. Now lets see how it looks so far. "The-" [shows he has only written "the" in fancy lettering] Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go... thinks SpongeBob think! [looks at the telephone. Cut to Patrick in bed, snoring. The phone rings and he wakes up]
Patrick: Who is that? [picks up phone] Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to?
Patrick: Sleeping.
SpongeBob: That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss? I remember on the...
Patrick: SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.
SpongeBob: [gasps] That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!
Patrick: Well, I'm listening.
SpongeBob: Uh... Marco!
Patrick: Polo! [hangs up]
SpongeBob: Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write? [hangs up phone] Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? [back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! [swats the shavings away but they float above the paper] Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long, pesky particles! [the shavings float back to SpongeBob. As he struggles to remove the shavings, he swallows one in the process] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What do you mean 'overly dramatic', Gary? [rubs his tummy] All that choking sure made me hungry.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary. I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see... White or rye bread... or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese [doorbell rings] A visitor? For me!? [SpongeBob opens the door to meet Norton the Mailfish] Hello! 
Norton: Package for Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Great thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?
Norton: It puts bread on the table.
SpongeBob: Rye or pumpernickel? [laughs]
Norton: Oh, brother..
SpongeBob: So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...
Norton: Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away]
SpongeBob: [Gulps and zooms in on his face] How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? [blipping his eyes and slides back into his house]
Johnny Elaine: In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off. [head sticks out TV] When will he learn?
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [karate chops the TV causing a zap and glass breaking. lights a candle]
Chair: Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat, put your feet up and relax.
SpongeBob: [gasps and a bell rings and drops the candle that went out and the clock lights up] Oh no! Midnight! [runs through the hallway of clocks and the alarms ring on the walls] Must... get... back to desk! [runs to the table, but it has enlarged. he jumps up on the chair] Whew, that was a close call. [his pants are missing] Ah! My pants!
Pants: Yoo hoo! Down here!
SpongeBob: You get up here! I've got to get back to work!
Pants: [runs out of SpongeBob's Pineapple to the door] Freedom!
SpongeBob: [runs out the door] Stop Pants, you get back here this instant! Paaants... [door closes, SpongeBob yelps, then tries to get back in, but it is locked. looks in the window. The candle is still lighting. The clock spins, breaks, and comes to life]
Clock: [ghostly voice] Time's up, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [gasps as the candle comes to life]
Fire Wick: Only 799 words to go! [laughs sinisterly as he burns the essay]
SpongeBob: No! [the fire wick burns his entire pineapple. He screams] What have I done?! [SpongeBob runs around his house, yelling] Help! Help! My house is on fire! [continues running around his burning house until it comes to life]
House: SpongeBob, why? Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob? Why didn't you just write your essay? Stop wasting time!
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Where's my essay! Oh, there you are! [laughs] I must have dozed off. [grabs his paper from his head] Lets see where are we? [holding his paper with a word "The" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk] Do I dare look at the clock... [slowly looks at the clock and gasps] It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes? How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight! [Writing] And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... [cut to SpongeBob running to the boating school] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is! [goes inside, but nobody is there] Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?
Mrs. Puff: Oh, there you are SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em.
Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you... I have to go to a teacher's convention!
SpongeBob: But what about my essay?
Mrs. Puff: I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!
[SpongeBob rips his essay. He then rips himself]


[The title card has men singing part of the song "Sailing Over the Dogger Bank"] ♪Watcha twigger she's a proper jubby-jewel... On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby!♪ [then we see the Krusty Krab at night]
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's the worst time of the day once again. [cringes as he changes the "Open" sign to "Closed"] Closing time!
SpongeBob: Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, SpongeBob! [pulls SpongeBob back] Take that pile of filth out with you. [Squidward holds up a trash bag with flies flying around it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!
Squidward: He means this filth, you loon! [He drops the bag on the floor]
[SpongeBob goes to the dumpster while bringing the trash bag]
SpongeBob: [singing] Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash.
[SpongeBob throws the trash in the dumpster and then looks at some writings on the dumpster.]
SpongeBob: Hmm... dumpster writing! The voice of the people! "Up with bubbles, down with air!" [laughs] "Nematodes are people too!" [laughs] Ha, those nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells. [writes the word "good" after "smells"] Good. [laughs] Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a [dolphin chirp].
Garbage man: [Clearly disgusted] Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
[picks up multiple garbage bags and leaves]
SpongeBob: Well, sometimes, but not... Recently.
Patrick: [off-screen] Hi, garbage man. [appears on-screen] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?
Patrick: "Krabs..." Uh, isn't that the red, sweaty guy you work for?
SpongeBob: [pointing to "Krabs," then the unseen word as they are said] Nah-uh, not that word, that word.
Patrick: Hmm... [dolphin chirp]! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.
SpongeBob: Sentence enhancers?
Patrick: You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-O! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it! Let me try. [clears his throat] Hello, Patrick. Lovely [dolphin chirp] day we're having, isn't it?
Patrick: Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This [dolphin chirp] day is particularly [dolphin chirp] lovely!
SpongeBob: How [dolphin chirp] right you are, Patrick!
[The two continue to say the word a few more times]
SpongeBob: Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation.
Patrick: Oh, mine, too!
[both laugh]
SpongeBob: It tingles when I laugh!
[SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab the next day]
SpongeBob: Hello, customers, nice [dolphin chirp] day we're having, uh? [The customers stop eating and stare in shock]
Harold: [gasps] Did he just say?!
Pirate fish: Aye, he did.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?
Patrick: [sitting at table at the Krusty Krab] Pretty [dolphin chirp] good, SpongeBob.
Old Man Jenkins: I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.
SpongeBob: [taps on the microphone and speaks into it] Attention, customers, today's special is a [dolphin chirp] Krabby Patty served in a greasy [dolphin chirp] sauce and grilled to [dolphin chirp] perfection. [a mother octopus covers her laughing children's ears and puts soda on one since she doesn't have enough hands] And don't forget to ask us to [dolphin chirp] the [dolphin chirp] fries. It will be our [dolphin chirp] pleasure. [Squidward hears the intercom and a giant human ear pops out of his head; he pushes it back in] Hi, Squidward, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?
Patrick: Nice [dolphin chirp] day, isn't it, Squidward?
Tom: I don't understand. That guy's talented, he doesn't have to work blue.
Evelyn: Let's go somewhere more family oriented. [Everyone leaves the Krusty Krab, grumbling in frustration]
Female fish: [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] I'm never eating here again.
Male fish: [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] Those foul-mouth bottom feeders.
[The Krusty Krab customer meter is running down; sirens wail and a red light flashes]
Mr. Krabs: [in the bathroom, hears the sirens] Huh? [looks through the periscope, sees that the Krusty Krab is empty and gasps] The Krusty Krab, she's empty! [runs to dining room with toilet paper stuck to one of his legs] All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?
Squidward: Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what was it? What'd he say?
Squidward: Er...he said...um, well he said...
[Squidward whispers]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Squidward whispers it again; Mr. Krabs gasps] SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.
Patrick: Yeah, it's fancy talk.
Mr. Krabs: There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
SpongeBob: You mean [dolphin chirp]?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, that one! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand up] Now quit saying that! [SpongeBob and Patrick frown] It's a bad word!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bad word?! [both start wiping their tongues while moaning]
Mr. Krabs: Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.
Squidward: Don't you mean there are only 7?
Mr. Krabs: Not if you're a sailor. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wow, 13.
Patrick: That's a lot of [dolphin chirp] bad words.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We promise.
[later at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing Eels and Escalators]
SpongeBob: Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!
Patrick: Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.
SpongeBob: Yeah, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators.
Patrick: Oh, boy, my favorite! [Flops arms up and down like a seal]
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! [rolls the dice]
Patrick: Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel.
SpongeBob: Darn. [moves game piece to eel]
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Hooray! Escalators! Yay! [screams] Up, up, up!
SpongeBob: Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators! [rolls dice] [sighs] Eels again.
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Escalators!
SpongeBob: Escalators, Escalators, Escalators! [throws dice] Eels?
Patrick: [rolls dice] Es-skee-lators! [moves to escalators] Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!
SpongeBob: [gets frustrated while rolling the dice] Escalators, escalators, escalators! [dice is thrown and lands on escalators] Ha! Escalators! [dice turn over to eels]
Patrick: Eels...
SpongeBob: Ah, [dolphin chirp]! [covers his mouth when he realizes his mistake]
Patrick: Ooooh...! You said number 11!
SpongeBob: [babbles for Patrick to understand] I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob, I understand. [pause] Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [starts running to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [starts running after him] No, wait, Patrick! [after SpongeBob catches up to Patrick] Patrick, no, please don't tell!
Patrick: But, you said "[dolphin chirp]"! [Covers his mouth as he realizes his mistake]
SpongeBob: Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!
Patrick: Not if I tell first!
SpongeBob: I can run faster than you! [laughs]
Patrick: [riding on the back of an ice cream truck] See ya at the Krusty Krab! Hahaha! [the truck turns at the wrong corner] Oh, nooooo!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What, what, what?
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes, yes?
SpongeBob: He said, he said, he said!
Mr. Krabs: Out with it, boy!
SpongeBob: [talking fast] Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things.
Mr. Krabs: [eyes SpongeBob] What kind of things?
SpongeBob: Well, he said...
Mr. Krabs: Yes?!
SpongeBob: Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?
Patrick: [walks in door of the Krusty Krab and eats an ice cream cone, but throws away the cone] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs sighs]
SpongeBob and Patrick: He said that word that you said we shouldn't say...!
SpongeBob: ...number thirteen...
[They babble on about the word, as Mr. Krabs stares on disapprovingly, until the two are just pointing at each other and yelling, "Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!"; Mr. Krabs eventually grabs their lips to quiet them.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mmm-mmm...!
Mr. Krabs: Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mmm-hmm... [Mr. Krabs lets go of their lips, which initially deflate, then reinflate; they both point at each other again] He said "[dolphin chirp]"!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash. [picks SpongeBob and Patrick up by their pants and carries them outside the Krusty Krab] You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. [walks back in Krusty Krab]
Patrick: What's going to happen to us?
SpongeBob: We'll probably get 40 lashes!
Patrick: Oh, no! [stupidly imagines himself blinking with 40 thick eyelashes]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.
Patrick: I'm sorry, too, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Agreed!
Mr. Krabs: All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for fouling the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom. [jams his foot on a rock then hops on one leg] Ow, Ooh! Ow! My [dolphin chirps] foot! What [dolphin chirps] genius put a [dolphin chirps] rock in a [dolphin chirps] path?! Can't you see I got a [boat horn no. 1] foot here?! Oh! [seal bark. Continues saying a bunch of swear words, censored out by seagulls, foghorns, ship bells, etc.; at this moment, SpongeBob and Patrick count the swear words he uses]
SpongeBob: Five, six, seven...
Mr. Krabs: ...a whole lotta [old-style foghorn] and with a side of [dolphin chirp], a heapin' helpin' of [ship's bell] and a boatload of [boat horn no. 4] ...
Patrick: Nine...
Mr. Krabs:  Ooh [seal bark, seagull squak]crabbin’ [a new-style foghorn] Ooh-hoo-uh! [cries in pain]
SpongeBob: [cuts to SpongeBob with thirteen fingers] That's all thirteen, Patrick! [gasps] We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [worried] No, please, not me mommy! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as they run to Mama Krabs' house, Mr. Krabs runs after them] Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!
[They go to the house]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [repeatedly banging on the door] Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!
Mama Krabs: Why, hello there!
[SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs all explain the situation at the same time, swearing numerous times as they do so]
SpongeBob: Mama Krabs, he said [dolphin chirp] and then he said [dolphin chirps] again and said [dolphin chirps] and then he screamed at the top of his voice [foghorn blows]!
Patrick: It was terrible.
SpongeBob: And he-- [horn honks]--Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of [seagull caws, foghorn, ship's bell] I have never heard in my days!
Mama Krabs: [shocked] Oh, dear! My poor old heart. [faints]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you? [takes a coin out of her pocket] You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!
Mama Krabs: [wakes up] You should all be ashamed. And if you're going to talk like sailors, then you're going to work like sailors.
[Then the three are painting her house; Patrick is painting the sand]
Mama Krabs: I guess you scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade. [laughs, then stubs her foot on a rock] Yeeeoww! My [Klaxon horn] foot!
[SpongeBob and Patrick gasp in shock] 
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] Mother!
Mama Krabs: What? It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy.
Old Man Jenkins: [driving by] Howdy, Mrs. K! [honks the horn]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Mama Krabs: [all laugh together]


Squidward: Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image. [wife's head turns into Squidward's and the husband notices] I'll go down in history. Someday, there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!
Janitor: Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.
Squidward: Uncultured trash urchin. 9 A.M. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer! [opens door] Welcome to art class!!
Nat: Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry... [everyone leaves except SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?
Squidward: SpongeBob!? In art class? WAIT! THIS IS COOKING! COME BACK! You gotta be kidding!
SpongeBob: [laughs] This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?
Squidward: You're looking at him.
SpongeBob: You... are the teacher? To my pupil?! This isn't art class, it's Heaven.
Squidward: Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.
Squidward: So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, please.
Squidward: Well, art is not all fun and games. [as he picks up a big stack of books] It's a lot of hard... [he drops the stack, which makes SpongeBob's desk hop in the air] ...work. Okay. First, repeat after me: "I have no talent."
SpongeBob: I have no talent.
Squidward: "Mr. Tentacles has all the talent."
SpongeBob: Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
Squidward: "If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacle's talent may rub off on me."
SpongeBob: If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art. [smiles. The scene cuts to Squidward with a sad look on his face, the camera cuts back to SpongeBob and he is still smiling, the camera again cuts back to Squidward]
Squidward: Whatever. Okay. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say [draws a crooked circle] circle one. [laughs] Am I going too fast for you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: How's this, Squidward?
Squidward: What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.
SpongeBob: Well, first I draw this head. [draws an amazing head] Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.
Squidward: Gimme that. [crumples paper] Forget the circles.
SpongeBob: Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try. [laughs] Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog! That's you on the bottom.
Squidward: Gimme that. [rips up paper] There is nothing artistic about leapfrog! [SpongeBob puts pieces together] What are you doing, now?
SpongeBob: I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped up paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time... [blows paper]
Squidward: Do you want to learn art, or not?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.
Squidward: Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. Then, gently... [hits marble with chisel; and it breaks into a pile of rubble]
SpongeBob: [hits marble with chisel and it becomes a perfect sculpture of Michelangelo's David] How's this Squidward?
Squidward: [starry-eyed] It's beautiful. [a tear falls from his eyes] I mean... this isn't a sculpture. [SpongeBob's lip starts quivering] A good sculpture takes... more time! You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules. [SpongeBob wipes away a tear] Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong. [Squidward puts a nose like his on the sculpture] There, now it's art.
SpongeBob: Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons. [falls down and starts crying] I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence. [crawls over to the front door and looks back at Squidward] I don't even deserve to use your doors! [the doors open, hitting SpongeBob out the window into the garbage dumpster head-first]
Monty: Hello, there!
SpongeBob: But I did deserve that. [the dumpster closes on top of him] I deserved that, too. [garbage man takes SpongeBob to dump] And I deserve this!
Monty: Good day, sir!
Squidward: Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.
Monty: Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags.
Squidward: The world famous art collector?
Monty: The one and only.
Squidward: Well, what are you doing here?
Monty: I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.
Squidward: Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: "Squidward en repose".
Monty: I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection.
Squidward: Why not?
Monty: Because. It's an art collection! [laughs]
Squidward: How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.
Monty: More like: Belongs in the Trash! [laughs]
Janitor: Sorry. I must've missed that one. [grabs the painting and throws it in the trash]
Monty: Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?!
Squidward: Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...
Monty: Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship! This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw. [removes the nose Squidward added on and it lands on Squidward's head] Ahh, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame...
Squidward: Fame! [Squidward imagines himself as popular]
Monty: ...fortune...
Squidward: Fortune! [Squidward imagines himself in a tub full of money]
Monty: ...anything his heart desires!
Squidward: Anything?!?! [Squidward imagines himself with hair] It's me! It's me! I'm responsible!
Monty: I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal! Now, uh, help me get this in the car.
Squidward: I could use a little help. [sculptures head falls off and turns into dust] My fame! My fortune! My hair!
Monty: Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one.
Squidward: Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.
Monty: Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks. [laughs]
Squidward: Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. [closes the door as Monty walks out] I gotta find SpongeBob! [at dump] SpongeBob...SpongeBob?! SpongeBob!?
SpongeBob: Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.
Squidward: Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.
SpongeBob: Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame. [he slides out of the cereal box] These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy! I can't look at them. [SpongeBob's hands pop off and run into a soup can]
Squidward: Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really!
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really!
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really.
SpongeBob: Wow... [pause] Really?
Squidward: Let's go.
SpongeBob: [notices a painting in the dump] Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!
Squidward: Gimme that. [back at classroom] Okay, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before.
SpongeBob: I... can't!
Squidward: Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again!
SpongeBob: I did it, Squidward. [draws a crooked circle]
Squidward: Huh!? But-but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the...?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book.
Squidward: Uhh... [crumples paper] How about this, huh? Remember?
SpongeBob: That's not in the book, either.
Squidward: FORGET ABOUT THE BOOK!!! [grips the book and rips it] Ha! Look at all this mess, SpongeBob! [he grabs a chair, puts it in front of SpongeBob's desk, and jumps up and down while holding it] What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do!?
SpongeBob: Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it! [puts book back together] There we go! Yeah!! Ta-da! [Squidward's nose melts off his face]
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.
SpongeBob: First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.
Squidward: Now you've got it.
SpongeBob: I've gotta embrace the marble!
Squidward: Right.
SpongeBob: I've gotta sniff the marble!
Squidward: Well, uh, okay.
SpongeBob: I've gotta lick the marble!
Squidward: Uhh...
SpongeBob: [washes the marble in a washing machine] I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble! [expands himself so that he's the same size as the marble] I'VE GOTTA BE THE MARBLE! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
Squidward: Here you go, buddy. [hands him sculpting tools]
SpongeBob: With this tool, I shall give birth... to art!
Squidward: Oh, boy... [SpongeBob taps marble with the chisel; it shatters into a pile of rubble]
SpongeBob: But, one more thing. [puts a stone nose shaped like Squidward's on it] There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in. [Squidward shrieks with frustration and goes crazy, runs through the marble and kicks two marbles, eating a part of the marble, he takes paint, squeezes it, kicks a picture, destroys the marble into 4 pieces and destroys the other marbles] It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump. [runs through the wall and down the road singing in the tune of the William Tell Overture] ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump.♪
Monty: I'm here for the... what the? Who is responsible for this?!
Squidward: As of now, it's his responsibility. [puts hat on janitor's head] Good day to you, sir! [this is a reference to "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory", where Mr. Wonka tells Charlie and Grandpa Joe that they lost the contest by saying: "You get NOTHING!!! You lose! GOOD DAY, SIR!"]
[It is revealed that when Squidward smashed all of the marble together, he created an even better sculpture than the first one and left without even seeing it]
Monty: [to janitor] You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!


[A jellyfish flies in the sky.]
French Narrator: Ahh, another beautiful day in Bikini Bottom's own Jellyfish Fields. An untamed world of natural order where the little jellyfish jellies roam free across the salty seascape. And where there is jellyfish, there is the Jellyfish Hunter.
SpongeBob: La la la la, la la la la la! [SpongeBob catches it] You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you "Twelvey." [tickles it with a feather] Coochie coochie coo! [it sneezes out some jelly] Bye, Twelvey! [Twelvey stings him as it says goodbye and flies away. He sees a blue jellyfish] Oh! It's you! [He mimics the jellyfish's style of floating, then tries to catch the blue jellyfish, but fails] Well, it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name.
No Name: [buzzes] [caption reads: "Bring it on!"]
SpongeBob:  [yells battle cries and tries to catch it. He runs. He steps on a soda can. He then runs so fast he flies like a rocket] Gotcha! [he is unsuccessful at catching it] ...Barnacles, how'd he do that? Someday, I'll catch old No Name.
[cut to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You've got 5 minutes!
SpongeBob: Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch! [he imitates a rocket launching and lifts his bag into the air] [a jar of jelly and a Krabby Patty fall out of the bag. He puts the jelly on the Krabby Patty and starts eating it.] Yum! [makes sounds, moans]
Fred: [Looks behind and stares at SpongeBob in confusion.] Hey, buddy! What the heck is that?
SpongeBob: Why, this is a hole, good sir. You see, I am a sponge, And we typically...
Fred: Not that! [points to SpongeBob's jelly patty] That!
SpongeBob: It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly.
Fred: Could I try some?
SpongeBob: Sure! [gives Fred some jellyfish jelly into his Krabby Patty]
Fred: [Eats the Krabby Patty with jellyfish jelly] Amazing... I've got to tell someone about this! ♪Hey all you people! Hey all you people! Hey all you people, won't you listen to meeeeeee... I just had a sandwich, no ordinary sandwich, a sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly! Hey, man, you've got to try this sandwich, it's no ordinary sandwich, it's the tastiest sandwich in the sea. Ah de ba da ba doo ba da ba de ba da da. Yeahhhhh... [The other Krusty Krab customers applaud him.] Thank you!♪
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?
SpongeBob: No one, Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers. [Showing some fish eating jelly patties happily. Shows love hearts and extremely satisfied customers.] Here you go, Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey.
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs the patty suspiciously] Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!
Fred: Sir, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten! I'm going to come back here for lunch everyday for the rest of my life! [A bill with Fred appears in it] Hey, buddy, you alright?
Mr. Krabs: [speechless, mutters incoherently]
SpongeBob: You okay, Mr. K?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!
Mr. Krabs: Well, keep dreaming. [Mr. Krabs gives him a jellyfish net] This'll be on your time.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Krabs: Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it [SpongeBob holds up a jellyfish in a jar] ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish.
SpongeBob: But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers. [Mr Krabs starts dramatizing depressing emotions] Oh, no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!
SpongeBob:  [gasps] No! Never!
Mr. Krabs: [optimistically] Then go out there and get me some more jellies!
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs:  [sinisterly, to himself] Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet! [chuckles]
SpongeBob: [jellyfishing with many nets. He then shows up with three jars] Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [painting a sign saying "Home of the Jelly Patty"] I'm gonna need more than that, boy.
SpongeBob: [cuts a rope. Many jellyfish are inside it. He shows up with five jars] More jellies, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [painting jellyfish on the walls of the Krusty Krab with the words "I Love Jellyfish" on his shirt] Oh, that'll never do. More!
[SpongeBob has a mustache on. A sign next to a jellyfish hive reading "FOR RENT" is shown. Jellyfish come in. They are trapped in a large net]
Mr. Krabs: [customers are lined up] More, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob is driving a large replica of himself. Its hand shows up at the Krusty Krab with a jar full of jellyfish]
Mr. Krabs: What don't you understand about... more?!
[Many SpongeBobs catch jellyfish]
Mr. Krabs: More! [SpongeBob catches two jellyfish with a net] More! [SpongeBob catches a jellyfish with a jar] More! [SpongeBob catches some jellyfish with a net while jumping leftwards to the screen] More! [SpongeBob tries to catch some jellyfish with a net by jumping rightwards to the screen] More... [SpongeBob manages to catch some more jellyfish with a net by jumping leftwards to the screen. Mr. Krabs now appears as a hideous caricature, popularly known as "Moar Krabs."] MOAR. [SpongeBob's catching goes wildly fast. Mr. Krabs now appears normal, but continually appearing] MOAR, MOAR, MOAR, MOAR. MOAR, MOAR. MOAR! [Cut to night. A sign reading "Jellyfish Fields. Pop. 0" is seen. "4 Million" is crossed out]
SpongeBob: Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!
[No Name secretly follows him]
SpongeBob: It feels like somebody... WANTS TO SELL ME SOMETHING! [Turns around and sees nobody]
Businessman: [hiding behind rock with another businessman] I told you he was on to us.
SpongeBob: [running away] I'm not interested in anything you're selling! [opens the door to his house and gets in as he looks out the window] I sure felt like... [laughs] I must be working too hard. [telephone rings] I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?
No Name: [breathing]
SpongeBob: [laughing nervously] Wrong number. [No Name has pliers and cuts the living room fuse and the lights go out. SpongeBob laughs nervously] I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill! [door opens and a small, black figure comes in] Gary, is that you? Gary? [the figure goes inside the kitchen] Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen. [light shines on a Krabby Patty with blue jellyfish jelly] Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly. [gasps] Blue jelly?! [No Name shows up] Hey, old No Name? What's happening?
No Name: [buzzing, shows a net and jar]
SpongeBob: [inside the jar] No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business? [No Name shows a factory] Hey, I don't remember that factory! [No Name shows him the inside] Huh? [Jellyfish are inside tubes. They are being sucked of their jelly. The dried out ones are put in trash cans. SpongeBob gasps] What is this horrible place? [a robot is tickling a jellyfish]
Robot: Coochie coochie coo. [jellyfish sneezes the jelly out and dries up]
SpongeBob: What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?
[Mr. Krabs is riding on an exercycle. It turns out that he's the monster who's responsible for this when SpongeBob caught the jellyfish of the fields]
Mr. Krabs: That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do?
[Mr. Krabs is shown wearing headphones and listening to an upbeat pop tune] 
Singer in the recording: ♪Give it all you got! Dance, dance, dance, get on it! Take it to the top...♪
SpongeBob: [breaks in, riding on No Name] Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!
Mr. Krabs: Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! A tea party! [No Name taps him] You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!
Mr. Krabs: Easy, boy, what are you doing with that?
SpongeBob: [holding an alligator wrench]  Something that should've been done a LONG TIME AGO!
Mr. Krabs: NOO!
SpongeBob: The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!
Mr. Krabs: [relieved] Whew!
SpongeBob: And now, I'm gonna set these jellyfish free! [tries to open it, but is unsuccessful]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say "open"! [Mr. Krabs realizes what he just said, and he covers his mouth, but it's too late. The sign on the door lights the words "OPEN" and the jellyfish escape.]
SpongeBob: Freedom! FREEDOM!!!
Mr. Krabs: YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME!!!! [He tries to pedal away as he laughs madly, then he looks down.] What?!
[Mr. Krabs sees that pedaling away didn't work, meaning that the excercycle never left the floor, and it remained intact on the floor, namely that an exercycle is meant for working out on it. The scene cuts to the jellyfish just right behind him, hovering over Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Blasted exercise craze...
[The jellyfish sting Mr. Krabs and he screams in pain. The jellyfish escape out the doors, possibly back to Jellyfish Fields.]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, friends!
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the factory and is incredibly burned] I'm taking jelly off the menu. [leaves]
SpongeBob: He really got burned on that deal! [laughs] All is as it should be. [brings out his jellyfish net] I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever! [No Name floats in SpongeBob's net. He gasps] Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... "Friend." [reaches his arm out. No Name does, but accidentally stings SpongeBob. He nervously smiles]


[Scene begins outside of the Fast Food Coliseum.]
Johnny: Welcome, sports fans, to the 21st annual Bikini Bottom Fry Cook Games.
[Horns are played as Harold the blue spotted fish runs into the stadium, holding a small torch. He runs up the stairs to a huge hamburger.]
Harold: I declare these Fry Cook Games... open!
[A gust of wind blows by and puts out the flame on the torch. The scene cuts to the "Please Stand By" screen. The screen cuts back to the stadium as the horns blow again and Harold runs back into the stadium, but this time, he is shielding the torch with his hand and panting. He runs back up the stairs to the huge hamburger.]
Harold: I declare these Fry Cook Games... open! [He lights the huge hamburger, then a second later, he starts being on fire]
Johnny: So begin the 21st Fry Cook Games. I'm a realistic Fish Head, and it's a beautiful day here at Bikini Bottom's Fast Food Coliseum.
[A clip plays showing a woman tossing a large straw into a large plastic cup]
Johnny: They come from everywhere microwaves hum.
[A clip of a man throwing an uncooked patty onto a grill]
Johnny: Patties sizzle.
[A clip of a fish bouncing on top of a large cube of gelatin and landing on a mat is shown]
Johnny: And heat lamps keep the fast food spirit warm... and soggy. But the real story is the bitter rivalry between former competitors Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab and Plankton of the Chum Bucket.
[Pictures of both Mr. Krabs and Plankton appear. A clip of Mr. Krabs lifting up two barrels of pickles is shown]
Johnny: Who could forget the year Mr. Krabs won gold for this five hundred pickle clean-and-jerk?
[Mr. Krabs is shown on a podium on the number one step, while Plankton is below him on the second]
Johnny: Not Plankton.
[Plankton sprays Mr. Krabs with a hose. A clip of Plankton flipping around while hanging onto two onion rings is shown]
Johnny: Or when Plankton won the hearts of millions by performing this perfect onion ring routine... with a broken antenna?
[A cast is around Plankton's left antenna. Plankton is shown in the number one spot on the podium this time, with Mr. Krabs below him]
Johnny: Krabs wasn't moved.
[Mr. Krabs blows Plankton off the podium]
Johnny: And now, late word is that this year, the Krusty Krab will be represented by a new competitor, on what is perhaps the greatest day of his young life. [A picture of a shadowy figure of a body with a question mark over it appears. The figure turns around and is revealed to be SpongeBob, wearing a sweatband and sports uniform. SpongeBob is standing next to Mr. Krabs, who is sitting on a bench staring at a stopwatch]
SpongeBob: This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr. Krabs.
[SpongeBob starts jogging in place]
SpongeBob: I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games.
[A spotlight shines down on him and he puts his hand on his heart]
SpongeBob: To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: And all that free publicity will bring in customers! So don't lose!
[Mr. Krabs walks away]
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
[SpongeBob starts doing pushups]
SpongeBob: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
[Patrick walks up]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob stops]
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick.
[SpongeBob continues doing pushups]
SpongeBob: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
[SpongeBob starts groaning]
Patrick: Are you trying to move the ground? You'll never move it like that. You gotta get under... [Patrick rips the piece of grass out from under SpongeBob, flipping him over] …neath it!
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games.
Patrick: Games? Can I play?
SpongeBob: Ah, sorry, Patrick.
[SpongeBob starts jumping rope]
SpongeBob: You have to be a fry cook.
Patrick: Be a fry cook? Is that all I gotta do? That'll be easy!
[SpongeBob tosses his jump rope behind him]
SpongeBob: What do you mean easy?
[Patrick laughs]
Patrick: How hard can it be?
SpongeBob: They don't let just anybody be a fry cook. We're an elite corp!
Patrick: Oh, come on. You're just flippin' patties.
SpongeBob: Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!
[Patrick flips a rock over with his foot]
Patrick: Tssss...
SpongeBob: Why don't you go home, Patrick? You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games!
[Patrick gasps]
Patrick: Well, at least I don't polish my fingernails.
[SpongeBob gasps and points at Patrick]
SpongeBob: You take that back!
[SpongeBob's index finger gleams. Patrick dances around]
Patrick: Fingernails! Fingernails! Fingernails!
SpongeBob: You don't even have fingernails.
Patrick: I cannot believe what I am hearing!
SpongeBob: [shouts] How can you hear it?! You don't have ears either!
[Patrick stutters]
Patrick: Holes! Holes!
SpongeBob: Cone head!
Patrick: Yellow!
SpongeBob: Pink!
[Patrick screams and holds his head]
Patrick: I'm gonna get a job as a fry cook and it'll be easy!
[Patrick walks off. SpongeBob growls and starts doing pushups again, but this time, he does it faster]
SpongeBob: Fine! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
[Mr. Krabs sniffs the air]
Mr. Krabs: What's that smell in the air? I smell Plankton!
[Camera zooms over to Plankton, who is standing in the entranceway of the stadium. Plankton pulls out a human nose from behind him]
Plankton: Oh yeah?! Well, I smell...[Plankton sniffs himself] Pew! He's right.
[Mr. Krabs runs over, his feet twinkling. Plankton does the same. Mr. Krabs makes a Broadway pose as corresponding music plays. Plankton makes a similar pose, holding a cane and a top hat. Mr. Krabs plays a piano, while Plankton blows into a tuba, messing up the rhythm]
Plankton: I love messing things up.
[Plankton meets up with Mr. Krabs by getting on a small platform and pulling a lever, which goes up to Mr. Krabs' height]
Plankton: Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Always ready, Plankton. Always ready.
Plankton: Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick... [Plankton raises his arm and accidentally whacks the lever, causing him to lower again. He raises it back up] ...your carapace!
Mr. Krabs: That's what you think, but I got me a champion-- SpongeBob! Show him! [SpongeBob does a karate routine, using two spatulas as nunchucks, then laughs innocently when he finishes] Look at him. In his prime. You ain't got no chance!
Plankton: That's where you're wrong, Krabs, for I too have a champion. [Plankton lowers a microphone] Ladies and gentlemen, turn your attention to the southwest corridor! [The crowd turns to the southeast corridor] Other way! [under his breath] Imbeciles. [The crowd turns to the southwest corridor] And... stop! Perfect. [In the entranceway, an extremely large shadow approaches, making loud stomps on the way] Representing the Chum Bucket, a creature so fearsome, so terrible, so mind-bendingly large, that those of you with weak constitutions may want to leave the stadium. [Two parents cover up their child's eyes, and he covers theirs. Mr. Krabs' eyes and nose sink into his shell. A muscular fish sits, trembling in the audience. He quickly gets up to leave]
Muscular Fish: I gotta get outta here!
Plankton: Too late! Ready or not, here he comes. Quake with fear, you mortal fools. Bow down before the awesome might of... [The wall of the stadium explodes. Fish fly everywhere. When the dust clears up, a huge, purple muscular fish is seen] ...this huge guy who is carrying the real contestant... [The huge fish turns around, revealing Patrick to be strapped to his back] ...Patrick Star!
[Patrick waves happily. SpongeBob stares in shock. He walks up as Patrick gets down from the huge fish's back]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing here? You're not a fry cook.
Patrick: Oh, yes I am, Mr. SpongeBob SuperiorPants.
[Patrick lifts up his shirt]
Patrick: Check it out!
[A name tag is stuck to his chest that says, "The Chum Bucket, Patrick."]
Patrick: I've been working for the Chum Bucket for almost five minutes.
SpongeBob: Well, it doesn't matter anyway, 'cause you're gonna eat my dust.
Patrick: Nuh-uh. I'm eating my own dust!
SpongeBob: Not if I eat it first!
Patrick: Yellow!
SpongeBob: Pink!
[The two walk away]
SpongeBob: I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. I thought Patrick was my friend.
Mr. Krabs: Friend? Not in here, he ain't.
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Plankton: He's not really your friend.
Patrick: He's not?
Plankton: He's plotting your downfall right now!
SpongeBob: He is?
Mr. Krabs: He's gonna stab you in the back.
Patrick: He wouldn't!
Plankton: Of course he would. Just look at him. Square: the shape of evil!
Mr. Krabs: He's making a mockery of your profession. Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: No!
Plankton: Then get mean!
Patrick: I'm mean!
Mr. Krabs: Get angry!
SpongeBob: I'm angry!
Plankton: Now get out there!
Mr. Krabs: And win...
Plankton: That...
Mr. Krabs: Medal!
Patrick: [screams]
SpongeBob: [screams]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both scream]
Huge Fish: [weak scream] Ahhh.
[Scene cuts to the first event]
Johnny: Our first event, the deep fry pole vault. [A deep fryer labeled "Fry King" sits in front of two high poles. SpongeBob stands in front of Mr. Krabs, holding a long pole]
Mr. Krabs: Win this one for the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: For the Krusty Krab! [SpongeBob flips over the poles and the deep fry and splats down on the circle drawn in the ground. The crowd gasps. SpongeBob forms a number one sign and the crowd cheers]
Plankton: Win this one because I told you to.
Patrick: Because you told me to! [Patrick flips over the poles, but lands on the handle of the deep fryer, flinging it at the crowd and turning them into fish sticks. A vendor walks up and turns on a heat lamp]
Lou: Fish sticks! Get your fish sticks here!
[Scene cuts to the second event. SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in front of a tall ladder that leads to a diving board, perched above a bowl of chocolate syrup]
Johnny: The next event: the chocolate high dive.
SpongeBob: Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick.
[SpongeBob climbs up the ladder]
Johnny: For his dive, SpongeBob will be attempting a full banana fudge pop with two sticks.
[SpongeBob holds up two popsicle sticks and sticks them into the top of his head]
Johnny: And now, absolute silence.
[The crowd stops chattering. SpongeBob jumps off the diving board]
SpongeBob: I scream for ice cream! [SpongeBob flips around a couple times, then leaps toward the bowl. He lands in the chocolate syrup, getting coated in it, then hops out of it and into a sandbox full of toasted almonds]
Johnny: Perfect entry! And toasted almonds? That's unexpected.
[SpongeBob lands in the circle]
Johnny: He stuck it!
[SpongeBob turns around toward the camera and grins]
Johnny: And just look at that even coating.
[SpongeBob walks upside-down past Patrick, using the popsicle sticks for legs]
SpongeBob: Top that, Pinky.
[Plankton walks up]
Plankton: Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!
[Patrick groans]
Plankton: Better than you!
[Patrick groans louder]
Plankton: Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!
[Patrick screams, then hops up onto the diving board with the lower half of his body inside an ice cream cone]
Johnny: Patrick will be resurrecting an old favorite. The single scoop strawberry cone with a chocolate dip.
[Patrick slowly leans off the edge until he falls off the diving board]
Johnny: Just look at that concentration.
[Patrick splashes into the bowl, with chocolate syrup flying everywhere]
Johnny: Ooh, a little shaky on that entry.
[A live action strawberry cone with a chocolate dip is shown]
Johnny: But just look at that form!
[Patrick hops up to SpongeBob grinning while SpongeBob is very angry about losing]
Patrick: Take that, yellow boy!
SpongeBob: Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet.
Patrick: That's what you think, but it's not over yet.
[A clip of highlights from the games is shown, beginning with SpongeBob tossing a patty. Patrick skates on a large grill with butter on his feet. Patrick tosses a large bottle of ketchup up in the air. SpongeBob and Patrick race on a track carrying trays full of food; the two fly up in the air on two large spatulas. They both do a dance wearing colorful outfits and fruit hats, Patrick's being 12 and SpongeBob's being 27. The clip ends. A large arena on top of a hamburger is on screen. The realistic Fish Head is still reporting]
Johnny: It's not over yet! With the score tied, we go to our final event! Bun wrestling. Who will take home the gold? Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: [rubbing SpongeBob's shoulders] Don't forget, he called ye yellow.
[SpongeBob picks up a metal chain, bites off and chews up the middle of it. He bares his teeth, revealing the metal chain to now be attached to them like braces]
Johnny: Or Plankton of the Chum Bucket?
Plankton: Don't forget, he called you pink!
[Plankton hops away. Patrick growls as he picks up a lemon, rips it in half, puts both halves into each of his eyes and screams]
[Heavy metal music plays. The bell rings. SpongeBob tears off his blue robe, showing off his extremely large, muscular body. Patrick rips off his own green robe, underneath which he is wearing a business suit. He tears off the business suit, also revealing an extremely large, muscular body. The two dive at each other, screaming, until they collide. They wrestle and continue to wind up in twisted positions. They spin around and wind up wrestling with themselves. They realize this, and dive back at each other. Patrick sits on top of SpongeBob, holding his foot]
Patrick: Forget the Chum Bucket. This is personal.
[Patrick takes off SpongeBob's shoe and licks his foot slowly. SpongeBob screams in agony. The two wrestle again. SpongeBob sits on Patrick's chest and lifts up a pencil with the eraser side pointing toward Patrick. He slowly brings it down to his name tag and erases the "Pat" in "Patrick", leaving "rick"]
Patrick: [screams] No! My name's... not... Rick!
[Patrick tackles SpongeBob in a puff of smoke and the two wrestle once more before they stop]
SpongeBob: I don't like you!
Patrick: I don't like you more!
SpongeBob: I never liked you!
Patrick: I a thousand times never liked you!
SpongeBob: Pink!
Patrick: Yellow!
[They struggle to push each other until both of their pants rip and fall down. Patrick's underwear is yellow. SpongeBob's underwear is pink]
SpongeBob: Yellow?
Patrick: Pink?
[Their eyes start to water]
SpongeBob and Patrick: You do care!
[They both start crying and hug each other]
SpongeBob: Let's promise never to fight again, buddy.
Patrick: Yeah, pal. Let's go home.
[The two friends walk off whistling and holding hands. The crowd boos. Mr. Krabs runs up]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Where ya going?
[Plankton runs up next to Mr. Krabs]
Plankton: Get back here and kill each other!
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the stadium, with arms on each other's backs]
Patrick: You're my best friend ever.
SpongeBob: You too, Patrick.
Patrick: You know, these were white when I bought 'em.


[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office with an adding machine, singing.]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profit will make me wallet fat!♪
[His eyes bug out at the ticker tape]
Mr. Krabs: What?! Profits down three dollars from last month! I got to start running a tighter ship around here!
[Meanwhile, Squidward is helping Martha in his ordering boat at the dining area of the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab. Here's your change.
[Gives Martha a dollar, and she walks off. Mr. Krabs approaches him.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: What's with all this "change" nonsense?
[SpongeBob walks over, knotting his tie.]
SpongeBob: Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up! [Squidward becomes exasperated, and sighs deeply] Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe.
Squidward: You hardly pay us at all.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you.
[He hands his employees envelopes.]
Squidward: Ah, yes! Our meager restitution. [He takes the envelope and smells it] Ah, the sweet smell of payday. [He opens it and finds a pair of underwear] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning. [Trades envelopes with him] Here's your check.
[He gives SpongeBob an envelope as well.]
Mr. Krabs: And here's yours, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs. [Holds up his spatula] Grilling is my passion.
[Mr. Krabs greedily takes the envelope back]
Squidward: What is this!?! [He sees that there is a bill instead of a check. It charges Squidward for breathing, talking, standing, existing, lollygagging, and chewing] You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?
Mr. Krabs: There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it.
[SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, preparing money for him]
SpongeBob: 18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe. [Mr. Krabs is drooling over SpongeBob's cash, and Squidward pulls SpongeBob towards him]
Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob: I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him.
Squidward: Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same.
SpongeBob: Why?
Squidward: We've got to unite as workers and demand the respect we deserve from the boss! In fact, you and I should go on strike!
SpongeBob: Wow! You and me go on strike?
Squidward: Sure! After all, you like your job, right?
SpongeBob: Right!
Squidward: And you want to keep working here, right?
SpongeBob: Right!
Squidward: And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?
SpongeBob: Right!
Squidward: Then let's go on strike!
SpongeBob: Yay! A strike! [He starts to sing excitedly] ♪Goin' on a strike! We’re goin' on a strike!♪ I still don't know what a strike means. ♪But we're goin' on a strike!♪ [He inadvertently kicks Mr. Krabs in the butt as Krabs sweeps the floor] Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!
Mr. Krabs: A strike?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: You mean you're going to make picket signs?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And you're going to make protest speeches?
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah!
Mr. Krabs: And you're going to demand me respect?
SpongeBob: Yeah! [Cut to SpongeBob sobbing outside of the Krusty Krab] Noo... [Squidward is with him] No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was gonna get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I... [He cries more] Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm gonna be sick.
Squidward: SpongeBob! [He grabs SpongeBob and pulls him off the door, but his arms and legs stick] News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too! [SpongeBob is suctioned to the door. Squidward pulls him off again, and this time his face remains pressed against the door] This is exactly why we need to go on strike. [SpongeBob flies back to the door. Squidward pulls him off once more, and this time SpongeBob's front sticks to the door, and we can see his skeleton and internal organs on his other side] He can't treat us like this anymore! [SpongeBob goes back to the door and Squidward's eyes become bloodshot] He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap. [SpongeBob and Squidward look through the door to see Mr. Krabs blowing dust off his old "Help Wanted" sign] Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united! [SpongeBob holds Squidward's hand] Ahem.
SpongeBob: [withdraws his hand] Sorry.
Squidward: Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time, you'll have your job back and more.
SpongeBob: And more?
[He imagines himself in his Krusty Krew uniform hat, except his hat is much bigger]
Squidward: Alright, SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms, [He takes off his hat] they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so. [Squidward throws it into the ground and stomps on it] Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob hesitantly takes his hat off] That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground.
[SpongeBob attempts to do so, but the hat sticks to his hand like gum.]
SpongeBob: [wails] I can't do it, Squidward! This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me.
Squidward: SpongeBob, you're pathetic! Look, I threw my hat to the ground.
[A police fish walks up to Squidward with a ticket]
Officer John: Aha! A confession! Next time, think before you litter.
[He sticks the ticket to Squidward's forehead and leaves. Later, Squidward and SpongeBob are painting signs]
Squidward: Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking.
[SpongeBob holds up a picket fence on a stick]
SpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?
Squidward: Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!
[SpongeBob holds up a sign that has a finger picking his nose]
SpongeBob: How's this?
Squidward: ...No. [Picks up his] This is a picket sign: Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point. [SpongeBob holds up his similar one that reads "Krusty Krab Funfair"]
SpongeBob: How about this, Squidward?
Squidward: SpongeBob, it's "unfair," not "funfair"!
[A fish walks by]
Sandals: A funfair? Where? I could go for some fun.
SpongeBob: At the Krusty Krab.
Sandals: Hey, everybody! Let's go to the fun fair! [A crowd of fish trample Squidward to get the restaurant. Later, SpongeBob is holding a sign that says "No Fair!" on it]
SpongeBob: Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!
[A teenager fish with a cap and braces walks up]
Teenage Fry Cook: What the heck does that mean?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.
Teenage Fry Cook: Then you must be SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob: Yep!
Teenage Fry Cook: Dude, you are like a fry cook legend! Will you sign my spatula?
[He pulls out a pen]
SpongeBob: Anything for an aspiring fry cook. [SpongeBob signs the spatula] So, did you come down to help out the cause?
Teenage Fry Cook: No, I came to take your job.
[SpongeBob is shocked. The fish grabs his spatula and pen and runs into the Krusty Krab to apply for a job]
Teenage Fry Cook: Hey, thanks, dude!
[Squidward walks up and bellows at SpongeBob through the megaphone so loudly that his facial features fall off, and he flies away.]
Squidward: Attention, SpongeBob! You are a terrible striker! [SpongeBob inserts his eyes into their sockets] You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward. [He holds up a sign reading, "I Heart the Krusty Krab"] How about I try the signs again?
Squidward: [into megaphone] Forget the signs! I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.
[SpongeBob stands next to a telephone pole.]
SpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?
Squidward: Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect. [We see that SpongeBob is now hidden behind the telephone pole. As Squidward begins to speaks, a crowd gathers] Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!
Miss Shell: I knew it!
[She slaps Dennis]
Squidward: The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr. Krabs!
[The crowd cheers]
Archie: Hey, what's that guy talking about?
Francis: I don't know, but he's got a megaphone.
Squidward: We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity!
[The crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: [From behind pole] Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing.
Squidward: With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!
[He speaks into Fred's face, and his eyes shoot into the back of his head. Then, they return to their sockets. Everyone cheers.]
Billy (lime fish): Wow, all this supporting is making me hungry.
Sandals: Hey, everybody! Let's go get a Krabby Patty.
[Everyone cheers and run into the Krusty Krab, once again trampling Squidward.]
Squidward: Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification.
[SpongeBob walks up to him.]
SpongeBob: That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands.
Mr. Krabs: But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!
SpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... um... Squidward, what was that other part?
Squidward: Dismantle your oppressive establishment?
SpongeBob: Yeah, that, too!
[Mr. Krabs pretends to yawn and leaves]
SpongeBob: And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!
[Squidward's eyes become bloodshot. SpongeBob's voice echoes "forever" in Squidward's mind as he opens the door to his house, takes a bath, looks in the mirror, and sits in bed, wide-eyed. He seems to have a case of insomnia as the word haunts him.]
Squidward: On strike with SpongeBob... forever?! [He imagines himself as an old man with a white beard holding a sign reading, "Krusty Still Unfair." Cobwebs branch from him to the ground. An old SpongeBob approaches him, supported by a cane]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day. [tugs Squidward's beard] Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward? [bonks Squidward on the head with his cane] Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward? [floats around Squidward] Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?
[Back to reality as Squidward lies in bed screaming.]
Squidward: I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!
[He runs to the door and opens it, and Krabs is there in his nightclothes, about to knock on it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy. [He grovels at Squidward's feet] The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone! [The teenagers appear right outside the door]
Teenagers: Alright, Mr. Krabs! [They give him the thumbs up]
Mr. Krabs: See what I mean? [sobbing] Squidward, please! You gotta come back!
Squidward: You'll give us anything we want?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms?
Mr. Krabs: I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.
[Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's pineapple house, where he sits on his bed listening to a country record]
SpongeBob: Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action! [He kicks open his front door, hammer and saw in hand. He runs to the Krusty Krab and into the dining room] I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board! [He pulls up a loose floorboard. He then saws a table in half] I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business! [He takes a bite out of a wooden column. Mouth full] Squidward will be so proud!
[Cut to Squidward and Krabs, now fully dressed, walking to the Krusty Krab at dawn.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations.
Squidward: I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!
[Squidward sees a disassembled Krusty Krab and screams. Krabs seems not to notice and hums as he puts his key where the door used to be, unlocking nothing. SpongeBob peeks out from the mangled sign pole. He runs out, trying to hold in his laughter.]
Squidward: S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?
SpongeBob: I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure.
[Krabs walks through the rubble of the Krusty Krab, oblivious, and sits in his chair. Only then, does he see the debris. Only the floor and base of the walls remain, so when he looks straight ahead from his chair, he can see Squidward and SpongeBob at the dilapidated door frame. Krabs' arms pop off followed by his eyes. His head slides off his torso and onto the floor where his nose falls out of it. Then his pelvis and legs fall out of his chair.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob is excited, but Squidward is nervous.]
Both: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: Here it comes!
Mr. Krabs: In order to pay off these damages, you two are gonna work for me forever!
SpongeBob: Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever!
["Forever" once again echoes inside Squidward's mind, and the camera zooms in on his bloodshot eyes.]
Narrator: One eternity later...
[The Krusty Krab is shown to have full of dust, but without any customers. Cobwebs are everywhere. A skeleton Squidward brushes off the floor, and a skeleton SpongeBob waits in the ordering boat.]


French Narrator: Ahh, another peaceful evening in Bikini Bottom. Listen to the tropical tranquility. [we see the town of Bikini Bottom; something underground is tunneling and consumes the Bikini Bottom sign] Uh-oh. [the tunneling thing moves on to the rest of Bikini Bottom; a cop is writing a ticket for a car parked near a fire hydrant; the thing, still invisible, makes eating noises; we then see that the car has disappeared, so the cop picks up the fire hydrant, moves it to the adjacent car, and places the ticket on that car, whistling as he casually walks away; the thing moves on to SpongeBob's house; Gary wakes up, sees the thing, and meows in terror; SpongeBob is still fast asleep]
SpongeBob: [mumbling, half-asleep] Two soups, please. Thank you. [the thing takes SpongeBob's blanket] You keep the change. [the thing takes SpongeBob's pillow] What? [he wakes up fully and stares fixedly at the thing in terror; camera zooms out to show half of the pineapple house's walls missing; a new scene shows SpongeBob talking to the crowd at the Krusty Krab] I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!
Patrick: That's horrible! [gobbles down a whole tray of food, containers and all]
SpongeBob: It was an ALASKAN BULL WORM!!! [each of the three words appears on screen; "Alaskan" written in icy letters, "Bull" written in furry letters, and "Worm!" written in letters that resemble worms. The crowd murmurs worriedly]
Fred: He ate my wheelbarrow! [he has his wheelbarrow with a bite taken out of it]
Nancy Suzy Fish: He ate my children's homework! [her two kids wink simultaneously and give a big thumbs-up]
Unnamed Fish 3: [has a huge bite taken out of his butt] ...Do I need to say it?
Unnamed Fish 4: [crowd murmurs some more] How can we protect ourselves?
Mr. Krabs: I've got it! Let's all buy a Krabby Patty! [crowd boos and throws ketchup and mustard bottles at him]
Nat Peterson: We should lock our doors!
Mable: We should call my nephew!
Knight Fish: We should dig a moat!
Patrick: We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else! [crowd immediately quiets down]
Squidward: That idea may just be crazy enough... TO GET US ALL KILLED! [crowd resumes fretting]
Patrick: [Amongst the murmuring] What's wrong with my idea?
Fred: Let's get someone to go after it!
Mr. Krabs: There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm! [a horrible screeching noise is heard; the crowd cringes; we see a scary-looking old guy in a raincoat with a hook for a hand, scraping it on the window of the Krusty Krab; he stops]
Unnamed Sailor: You got a bathroom in this place?
Mr. Krabs: [looks slightly peeved] In the back.
Unnamed Sailor: [legs wobble] Thanks. [he runs for it]
Sandy: [under a wide-brimmed cowboy hat] I'll catch your worm for ya, that is if'n you're willin' ta pay. [tips brim up]
Mr. Krabs: NOOOO! YOU'LL NEVER GET A CENT OUT OF ME! [runs to block the cash register with his body] NEVER! I'D RATHER THAT WORM COME IN HERE RIGHT NOW AND EAT YOU ALL ALIVE!!! [begins foaming at the mouth; the crowd looks at him strangely; he calms down] ...Sorry.
Sandy: [laughs good-naturedly] Aw, shucks. I don't want your money. I was just playing up the drama of the moment, is all. [Mr. Krabs chuckles, which gradually turns into crying; Sandy continues] Nope. I'm not gonna take that spineless critter down for nothing, 'cause this is personal. Look. My tail's gone! [she shows them; crowd gasps] Varmint must've got it while I had my back turned, the coward! [crowd sympathizes] I am gonna get back what's mine! [crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: [looks alarmed] What!?! But, Sandy, you don't know what you're up against! We're talking about an ALASKAN BULL WORM!!! [the three words appear on screen again]
Sandy: Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here. [she pulls out a wallet with pictures] Back in Texas I wrangled bulls, and I wrangled worms. [we see pictures of a real-life squirrel with a lasso around a bull, then a lasso around a worm] Far as I'm concerned, doing 'em both together just saves rope. Now I'm gonna go kick me some worm tail! Yee-haw! [she runs to the doors of the Krusty Krab; the crowd goes wild]
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, you don't know!
Sandy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I won't be long. [leaves]
SpongeBob: [chases after her] Sandy! Sandy!
Mr. Krabs: [amidst the still-cheering crowd] Go get 'em, Sandy! We have the utmost confidence in you! [crowd stops; Mr. Krabs turns to Patrick] Now, what was that idea of yours? [scene cuts to all the citizens trying to push the buildings of Bikini Bottom]
Patrick: PUSH!!!! [citizens strain as they try to push the town; cut back to SpongeBob chasing after Sandy]
SpongeBob: Wait! Sandy!
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob, you coming to watch?
SpongeBob: Sandy, don't go!
Sandy: Why not?
SpongeBob: Sandy, I saw it! It's BIG, SCARY AND PINK! [each word appears on the screen; "Big" displayed in large letters, "Scary" in green drippy letters, and "Pink" in pink fuzzy cursive letters]
Sandy: So's Patrick's belly button, but I ain't afraid of that, neither.
SpongeBob: You'll get massacred! [collapses into sponge-cubes]
Sandy: SpongeBob, I'm from Texas. What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different "big"s. Besides, he's got my tail. I can't take that sitting down.
SpongeBob: Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?
Sandy: If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?
SpongeBob: [unconvincingly] Um, I do?
Sandy: You do? Where?
SpongeBob: Um... in my pocket.
Sandy: Well, why didn't you just say so? Give it here! Come on! [SpongeBob looks nervous, pulls something from his pocket, and opens his hand] SpongeBob, that's a paper clip... and a piece of string.
SpongeBob: [shakes head, meekly] No, it's not, this is your tail.
Sandy: [annoyed] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [defensively] HOW WOULD YOU KNOW!? IT'S ALWAYS BEHIND YOU! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go! [he jumps onto the front of Sandy's air helmet and hugs it]
Sandy: [pulls him off] SpongeBob, what is the matter with you? Now, I'm gonna go give that legless rascal what-for... and there ain't nothin' you can say to stop me! [resumes walking]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? What if I said... 'blargen fedibble no-hip'?
Sandy: [stops] Well, I gotta admit, that's slowing me down, but I'm still going for him! [continues]
SpongeBob: [appears next to Sandy as she strides along] You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home. [Sandy keeps walking; SpongeBob reappears] I've got ice cream! With nuts... [Sandy continues; SpongeBob appears once more, this time with a goofy squirrel mask on his face] Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!
Sandy: You ain't my pa!
SpongeBob: [stands in front of her with boxing gloves] Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me! [Sandy pushes through his body as if walking through a pair of swinging doors; he grabs her ankles, crying] Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!
Sandy: Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me. I'm too Texas tough!
SpongeBob: [still crying and holding onto her ankles] No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!
Sandy: SpongeBob, quit your worrying. I can take care of myself. After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom? [she grabs an anchor and pulls a boat down from the surface]
SpongeBob: You are.
Sandy: And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, "K" in karate? [makes a K shape]
SpongeBob: [shaped like a U] You did.
Sandy: And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?
SpongeBob: [his butt has "Property of Sandy Cheeks" printed on it, states it meekly] You do.
Sandy: Right. And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is! There ain't nothin' too big or too ornery for me to catch.
SpongeBob: Okay.
Sandy: Say it.
SpongeBob: There isn't anything...
Sandy: Ain't nothin'!
SpongeBob: [in a high-pitched voice like Sandy] Ain't nothin' [normal voice] too big or too ornery for you to catch. But... [Sandy cuts him off] But... [cuts him off again] And... [cuts him off again] We... [cuts him off again] I... [cuts him off again] Yeah but...
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: You see...
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: I... [Sandy cuts him off one last time with a frustrated groan]
Sandy: [picks up some sand from the ground as if tracking an animal and sniffs it] Worm sign. [she holds a small sign in her palm that has "WORM" painted on it; looks up] He's in that cave.
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you sure you...?
Sandy: Course I am! I'm going in, and I ain't coming out 'til I got me a big heaping plate of worm stew. [she walks into the cave; SpongeBob hides behind a rock and shudders; we hear Sandy inside the cave] Aha! There you are, you tail-nabbin' varmint! Hi-yah! [we hear karate noises; Sandy peeks out of the cave] I'm winnin', SpongeBob! [resumes fighting]
SpongeBob: Sandy, that's not...! [more fighting noises; Sandy peeks out again]
Sandy: This shouldn't take long. [resumes fighting]
SpongeBob: Sandy, that's not...!
Sandy: Almost done!
SpongeBob: Sandy!
Sandy: Yee-haw! [comes out riding a pink segmented thing] I got him, SpongeBob! [makes a giant knot and stands on it proudly]
SpongeBob: [still uneasy] Sandy...?
Sandy: Boy, howdy. This critter put up some sort of fight. But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me. I even found my tail! [we see that she has tied the fur to the small remainder of her tail]
SpongeBob: That's not the worm.
Sandy: [looking annoyed with her arms crossed] Pardon?
SpongeBob: That's not the worm. That's his tongue! [camera zooms out to show that SpongeBob is right; the opening of the cave is actually the worm's open mouth; his eyes make a squishy blinking noise]
Sandy: ...Ohhhh, this is the tongue. And the whole thing is the... worm. [freaks out] RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! [they sprint away; the worm chomps down, roars angrily, and chases after them]
SpongeBob: So what's the plan, Sandy? [they look back and see that the worm is approaching faster]
Sandy: Run faster!
SpongeBob: I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!
Sandy: Later!
SpongeBob: Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?
Sandy: Not now, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I wanna hear you say it!
Sandy: Can we talk about this another time?
SpongeBob: Say it!
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Say it, or I'll trip you! [he continues running on one foot, the other poised to trip Sandy]
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: Say it!
Sandy: Not now!
SpongeBob: Say it!
Sandy: Okay! You were right, and I was wrong. I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Are you happy now?
SpongeBob: [smiles triumphantly] I knew it. [the worm emits another huge growl; prompting the two to run even faster; they run up and down a sand mound, which the worm plows right through; they run past Fish 3, who is leaning over under his car's hood; his butt is bandaged up; the worm passes by and takes another bite out of him]
Unnamed Fish 3: Not again!
SpongeBob: Uh, Sandy?
Sandy: Yeah?
SpongeBob: What do we do now?
Sandy: [is panting and sweating; the worm growls again; Sandy sees the seemingly endless coral trees in front of them] I've got it! SpongeBob, you still got that paper clip and that string?
SpongeBob: I'm way ahead of you, Sandy. [fashions a necklace out of them] Look, it's a necklace! S for "SpongeBob" or S for "Sandy"! That way they can identify our bodies!
Sandy: No, silly! How about S for "save our skins"? [she takes the string and uses the hook of the paper clip to wrap the string around one of the coral trees; she grabs SpongeBob and swings them up and over the branch onto the worm's back] Yee-haw! Now this is what I call a rodeo! We'll be nice and safe up here! [the worm starts to plow off a cliff like a runaway train; Sandy and SpongeBob realize this, scream, and begin running toward the end of worm to the safety of the plateau; they jump off safely as the worm falls off the cliff] We did it!
SpongeBob: Yay! He'll never get out of there!
Sandy: We saved the town!
SpongeBob: Yay! Let's go tell everybody! [they leave the scene and new scene shows all the citizens still trying to push Bikini Bottom to safety; the city is now in the valley at the bottom of the cliff]
Patrick: PUSH!!!! [citizens push the city] PUSH!!!! [push one last time]
Citizens: Hooray! [the worm lands on the city and crushes it]
Worm: Ouuuuuch...


[Scene begins at the Krusty Krab with Old Man Walker walking into a pole]
Old Man Walker: Oh! Pardon me, young lady. [Takes glasses off to get a better look] What a fox. [Walks over to Condiment Island, and puts a bottle of ketchup on his tray. Plankton is in the ketchup bottle]
Plankton: [Makes an evil laugh] Ooh! [His machine detects a Krabby Patty. Makes another evil laugh.] You're all mine you sweet Krabby Patty. Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo! Ah ha ha ha ha ha! [Alarm goes off inside the ketchup bottle, and Plankton buckles himself] Initiating launch sequence. [Puts on a mask and unzips mouth zipper] Krabby Patty, here I come!
Old Man Walker: [holding ketchup bottle unsteadily] Eh, eh... I hope I don't miss again. [Old Man Walker presses the bottle but he points the bottle forward, missing the patty and releasing Plankton]
Plankton: Reunited, and it's gonna feel so good! [Unzips eye zipper, screams as he crashes through the wall. Squidward makes a shocked expression and he looks at the hole] D'oh!
Mr. Krabs: [He sweats and he has dollar bills covering his eyes] Ooh, ooh, ooh, sweet wampum. [Plankton bounces around his office] Huh! Whazzat? [He hides under his desk for protection] Squidward, where are you? Shield me with your forehead! [Plankton finally lands right next to the desk, and Mr. Krabs picks him up] So, it was a just another failed Krabby Patty theft attempt by my [Close-up. He spits saliva at Plankton as he talks] arch competitor, Plankton! [Laughs] For a second there, I mistook you for a threat. But you're just a dirty little man. [He flicks Plankton away] So long, shrimp! [An actual shrimp who is exiting the Krusty Krab turns around]
Plankton: [flies towards the Chum Bucket] Curse you, Mr. Kraaaaaabs! [collides into the wall of the Chum Bucket] Ow! [lands on the ground] Ouch! [Plankton walks into the Chum Bucket, sighing]
Karen: So, typical day of failure, I see, huh, darling?
Plankton: Oh, can it, computer wife. Can't you see I'm exhausted? Why don't you go make yourself useful and synthesize me up some grub? [opens the fridge to get a can of soda]
Karen: Yes, your majesty. [Holographic meatloaf appears on the table that Plankton's sitting at. Plankton sits at his table.]
Plankton: What do we got here? [sarcastically] Oh, goody. Holographic meatloaf again! When am I gonna get some real food? Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food. Just look at his daughter, she's as big as a whale! I wish I could be successful like Mr. Krabs. [opens his can of soda that he got from his fridge] I wish I could somehow just switch lives with him. Just to know what it's like. [Drinks some soda]
Karen: Then why don't you just use that "Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier" thing you built last Tuesday? [Plankton spits out his soda]
Plankton: What a brilliant idea! Your parents must have been like, part computer or something. [Karen sighs. Plankton sits down in front of the Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier] Now, let's see here. [A picture of a jellyfish shows up on the Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier] No... [a dolphin appears] no... [a mermaid appears] no... [Finally, a picture of a crab in the shape of Mr. Krabs shows up] A-ha! [Plankton is buckled up] Well, I hate to leave you, Karen, but you know what they say... a rolling stone gathers no algae. [Plankton presses a button, and then goes through a hole of space and time and screams. Plankton stops for a few seconds to get a drink of soda. He smacks his lips afterwards] Ahh... [he then resumes screaming. Later, Plankton wakes up at Mr. Krabs' desk] Ugh... dear Neptune above, what happened last night? Huh, what's this? [Plankton picks up a name plate reading "Mr. Plankton"] Mr. Plankton? [Plankton picks up a picture of Pearl] Who the Davey? [Plankton looks out the office windows and sees people eating Krabby Patties] Ehh... I'm in the Krusty Krab... and that means the life switcher was a success! The Krusty Krab is mine! [Plankton sees himself dressed] Corporate casual!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob SquarePants: Order up! Two deluxe Krabby Patties.
Mr. Plankton: [Plankton's eye turns into a Krabby Patty] At last!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: [SpongeBob delivers food to customer] There you are, sir. Two deluxe... [Plankton appears at the table] Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton.
Mr. Plankton: Er, um, hey there, uh, SpongeBob. Uh, SpongeBob?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Yes, sir!
Mr. Plankton: I'm gonna need to take one of these Patties back to my office for um, bun inspection.
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton!
Mr. Plankton: Why- why not?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Because that Patty is for the customer, sir!
Mr. Plankton: The customer? I'll boil the customer in hot oil, and rip out his— [SpongeBob's eyes point to Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson, who's the customer, to stop Plankton] I mean, yes, of course, for the lovely... customer.
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gives Plankton two Krabby Patties] But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir!
Mr. Plankton: Uhh... yes, uh, very nice. Um, thanks. [Plankton runs back to his office] All mine, it's finally all mine! The Patties... [shows Mr. Plankton's rich wealth in his money vault] The wealth... [shows business award and Clams Magazine award frames on the wall] The notoriety! The... [Plankton sees SpongeBob in his office] SpongeBob, what do you want?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review!
Mr. Plankton: Review?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Oh, yes, please, sir, please!
Mr. Plankton: But I've never reviewed anything... except those foreign exercise videos my cousin sent me.
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud!
Mr. Plankton: Eh, you're doing fine. Now leave me to my work. [kisses one of the two Krabby Patties]
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: But, sir!
Mr. Plankton: I thought I sent you away, cretin!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: But, sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. Anything!
Mr. Plankton: All right, the sauce.
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: [gasps] Wh-what?
Mr. Plankton: The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over.
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: [SpongeBob's face changes into a stereotypical Asian face. Jerkily moves arms in and out each time he stutters out the following words...] Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
Mr. Plankton: What?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
Mr. Plankton: What's the matter with you? All I said was "A little too much sauce." It's no big deal, really.
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
Mr. Plankton: What do you want from me, a promotion?!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: [SpongeBob's face changes back to normal] A pro- a promo- a promotion?!
Mr. Plankton: Uh, sure, kid, you're uh... you're on register now.
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: [Gasps excitedly] Register! [SpongeBob explodes. Plankton gets back to the Krabby Patties]
Mr. Plankton: Glad that's over. [Kisses the same Krabby Patty]
Alternate-Universe Squidward J. Q. Tentacles: [Squidward standing at the cash register reading a book, when he realizes that SpongeBob is standing right next to him] SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about 'personal space'?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!
Alternate-Universe Squidward: [SpongeBob points out his badge that says "Co-Cashier"] Co-Cashier?!
Mr. Plankton: [Plankton is sitting at a table with the two Krabby Patties.] So, have you two known each other long? [Candle suddenly extinguishes by itself as the door opens suddenly] Huh?
Alternate-Universe Squidward: [Squidward storms into Mr. Plankton's office] You can't do this to me, Mr. Plankton! If you think I'm going to stand out there all day listening to... [Cuts to SpongeBob, whose mouth splits in two while SpongeBob talks rubbish]
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... [Cuts back to Squidward]
Alternate-Universe Squidward: Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!
Mr. Plankton: So what do you want me to do about it?
Alternate-Universe Squidward: I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean.
Mr. Plankton: [Squidward's now the fry cook, standing in front of the grill] Hope you like gray. [Hops off the window between the cashier stand and the grill]
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, I can see you through this little window! [Alternate-Universe Squidward groans.]
Mr. Plankton: [Mr. Plankton heads back to his office] Now, no more intrusions! I'd like to begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the—
Pearl Plankton: [Pearl Plankton runs inside the Alternate-Universe Krusty Krab. [Mr. Plankton is being bounced up and down as she runs in.] Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! [Jumps up and down, making him bounce again]
Mr. Plankton: Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!
Pearl Plankton: Could I please have a um... an advance on my allowance?
Mr. Plankton: If it'll get you out of my antennae. [Plankton gives Pearl a one dollar bill] Go crazy.
Pearl Plankton: One dollar!? You hate me! [Pearl begins to cry. Shows closeup of the enormous tears. Mr. Plankton attempts to dodge all of the tears, but a drop ends up landing in his mouth, making him a circle]
Mr. Plankton: Ow!
Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson: [walks out and angrily flattens Plankton, getting all of the water out] You!
Mr. Plankton: Me?
Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson: You think this is funny?
Mr. Plankton: In a cosmic sort of way, yes.
Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson: Well, Mr. Funny Man, is this how you get your sick kicks?! [Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson shows Mr. Plankton a Krabby Patty]
Mr. Plankton: What? It's just an ordinary Krabby— [Scene zooms in to show the patty made with gross-out items] Oh, my goodness! Squidward!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Alternate-Universe SpongeBob appears at the table, next to Mr. Plankton] I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did.
Mr. Plankton: Oh, what now?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name! [Repeatedly screams out "Soiled it!" for a very long time]
Mr. Plankton: I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post! [Mr. Plankton pushes his hand is Alternate-Universe SpongeBob's chest, in hopes that he'll stop] Where's the off button on this thing?
Pearl Plankton: [Pearl Plankton walks up to Mr. Plankton] Okay, Daddy. I've decided I'm gonna run away! Run away and find a new daddy!
Mr. Plankton: Make it stop! [A siren horn then goes off and then everyone becomes silent, including Alternate-Universe SpongeBob] What, did I say the secret word?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: No, sir, he's back.
Mr. Plankton: Who's back? What? [Something red flashes by] What was that?!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: [An alarm sounds] Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover! [All the Alternate-Universe customers scream, and run to take cover]
Mr. Plankton: [he runs in circles] Take cover from what?!?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: [Alternate-Universe SpongeBob's up in the crow's nest searching for him] He's around here somewhere. [Alternate-Universe SpongeBob sees the red flash by once again] There he goes!
Mr. Plankton: What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me!
Alternate-Universe Harold Bill Reginald Scott: Some say he crawled out from the lowest trench in the ocean.
Pearl Plankton: He's the saltiest of all the sea dogs.
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom. [The red flash then bursts out of the kitchen and we then see it is Krabs holding a Krabby Patty while swinging on a rope]
Krabs: And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!
Mr. Plankton: Krabs?! What the barnacles is going on here?!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant.
Mr. Plankton: That's terrible!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Yeah! But the worst part is...
Mr. Plankton: [Krabs lands behind him. Shows a Dutch-angle, low-angle shot of naked Mr. Krabs and Mr. Plankton's surprised] Good grief, he's naked! [A part of Krabs then glints]
Krabs: [Swings up onto a board on a support beam above. Laughs.] Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs! [The cash register spins upside down, and turns into a place where a cannon is located. Alternate-Universe SpongeBob shoots a green shirt out of the cannon at Krabs, but Krabs dodges the shirt and runs somewhere else in the Alternate-Universe Krusty Krab while laughing.] No shirt, no shoes... no service! [SpongeBob shoots all the other clothes out of the cannon at Krabs, but all of them miss]
Krabs: Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar! [Krabs stops laughing, as he realizes that a bra has caught him] Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty! [Krabs throws the Krabby Patty back to Mr. Plankton]
Mr. Plankton: [catches the Krabby Patty] I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech! [Alternate-Universe SpongeBob and all the other Alternate-Universe customers start screeching, except for Mr. Plankton, who's hearing all that screeching.]
Krabs: Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!
Krabs: Oh, but I will! Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day... [Mr. Plankton's red pupil from his yellow eye shrinks and starts sweating as he starts to become scared, and Krabs leaves the Alternate-Universe Krusty Krab.] And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: [Alternate-Universe SpongeBob hands Mr. Plankton a phone] Phone call, Mr. Plankton.
Krabs: [On the phone] And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...
Mr. Plankton: [screams, then rips off his clothes and becomes Plankton again] It's not worth it! It's just not worth it! Goodbye, everyone. I'll remember you all in therapy. [Plankton presses the button for the Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier. He ends up back in the Chum Bucket. Holographic meatloaf is on the table] Holographic meatloaf? My favorite! [Plankton starts eating it, and is happy again as the episode ends.]

Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon. Where the sun is hot and the sunbathers are oh so cool. [SpongeBob is laying on his back on a towel]
SpongeBob: What a beautiful day.
Patrick: You said it, pal.
SpongeBob: Can you believe that sun? [Patrick's eyes are singed]
Patrick: I could look at it all day. [SpongeBob sits up then takes his sunglasses off]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick? [Patrick's eyes go back to normal after he takes a drink]
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: Nothing.
Patrick: So, how's that tan coming?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Let me check. [lifts his pants and looks at his tan] Looking good. How's yours?
Patrick: Just a minute. [lifts his shorts and screams because his rear-end is showing. Patrick lays on his stomach] I could have sworn I was laying on my back. [both laugh as a swarm of people run by them. Larry is lifting six people on a surfboard. Everyone cheers]
SpongeBob: Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard! [three girls walk up to Larry]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Mr. Lifeguard, can I feel your muscle?
Larry: Sure. Don't scratch the paint. [Nancy and friends run off after feeling Larry's muscles. Scooter and friends come up next]
Scooter: Lifeguard, how’s the tubage?
Larry: Gnarly, dudes!
Scooter and friends: All right, yeah! Woohoo! [Scooter and friends run off as an elderly couple come up]
Dennis: Lifeguard, can you point out the snack bar?
Larry: Right over there! But you guys are way too old and unsightly for my beach. And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Mable: [both walk off] So polite.
Dennis: Just like we raised him.
SpongeBob: What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine... if I were a lifeguard. [imagines himself in a lifeguard watchtower] That would be so cool!
Patrick: Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys. [Larry is being carried by a bunch of fish] Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies! [Patrick's belly expands. Nat walks by]
Nat: [Points at Patrick's belly] Dude, put that thing away. There are, like, children here. [Patrick pushes his belly fat into his feet]
Patrick: I'm going to the snack bar. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool. [zooms into a geek-like looking SpongeBob] I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by... [thunder roars] ...a flying ice cream truck. [ice cream truck with wings comes falling down] And live! [ice cream truck slows down and lands on top of SpongeBob, then drives away. SpongeBob's towel flies away]
Larry: [speaking into a megaphone] Please do not land flying ice cream trucks on the bathers! [As SpongeBob gets up, a vanilla ice cream cone falls off his nose] SpongeBob, you okay? [Larry notices the vanilla on SpongeBob's nose and mistakes it for sunscreen] Hey! I didn't know you were a lifeguard.
SpongeBob: Lifeguard?
Larry: The nose?
SpongeBob: [swipes his finger on his nose to see the ice cream] White stuff! You think I'm a lifeguard?
Larry: Sure! There’s no hiding the lifeguard look, SpongeBob, and you've got it.
SpongeBob: You really think so?
Larry: You bet I do. Say, we're a little shorthanded around here. How would you like to work the beach?
SpongeBob: [high voice] I'd love it! [hugs Larry]
Larry: Alright. [puts SpongeBob down] Leave that on the bench, Kahuna. Hey, Annette, come here! [fish walks over] I want you to meet my buddy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi. [Annette kicks sand in his face]
Larry: Hey, guy's a lifeguard. [Annette whistles as Nat, Shubie, and Bill run over and pick up SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: It works! [SpongeBob has a suit similar to Larry's. Larry and SpongeBob walk around the beach blowing their whistles. Larry is putting lotion on Sadie and gives SpongeBob a thumbs-up. SpongeBob is putting lotion on Old Man Jenkins. Larry makes sand castles with children; SpongeBob lifts a bucket revealing an actual castle. The children play in the castle and Larry gives SpongeBob a thumbs up. Larry lifts some anchors as SpongeBob lifts two soda cups with straws for weights, Nat walks up and takes a cup, SpongeBob falls over on one side. Both hula dance playing ukuleles] Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry!
Larry: Yeah! Say, how'd you like to take the second shift?
SpongeBob: By myself?
Larry: Only if you think you're ready. [SpongeBob holds up a jar of zinc-oxide]
SpongeBob: I'm not just ready. [puts some of the zinc-oxide on his nose] I'm ready, Freddy.
Larry: It's Larry. Well, I guess I'll just...
Fish #2: Help, help! [a fish struggles in the water] Help, help, help!
Larry: We've got a sinker! SpongeBob, let me take this. I haven't seen any action all day.
SpongeBob: Action?
[Larry runs across the beach and dives into the water.]
Fish #2: Please help, please help! [Sinks underwater. Larry goes underwater to rescue him. Everyone gasps. Larry emerges from the water holding the unconscious fish. Everyone cheers except SpongeBob]
Larry: Breathe, darn you! [starts to punch the fish in the stomach. The fish regurgitates water and a book]
Fish #2: That's the last time I read and swim! You saved my life!
Larry: Don't mention it. It's all part of the job. [Larry walks up to SpongeBob, who is stunned] You know, SpongeBob, the babes and the big chair are great, but the best part is knowing you're the only thing that stands between these good people... [notice a sign that reads "Annual Hot Dog Chug" and everyone is rooting for Scooter, who is eating a bunch of hot dogs] ...and a watery grave. And that's what its all about. [a boat drives up] Their lives are in your hands now, ‘cause I got a date with the tanning booth. [Larry jumps in the boat with Nancy, Pilar, and Shubie] See ya. [the boat drives off]
SpongeBob: But I... [an inner tube inflates around him] ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes! [throws the inner tube off] Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen? [imagines everyone in the lake turns into tombstones. He screams, runs up to the lifeguard tower and rings the bell, then speaks into a megaphone] Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water! [the entire crowd runs out of the water] Emergency! [everyone wonders what is going on] Uhh... there are sharks in there! [a family of sharks is shown in the crowd]
Father Shark: Hey, that's my family you're talking about!
SpongeBob: Uhh... sea monster! [a giant, green sea monster walks over]
Sea Monster: You know, we sea monsters have made great strides in the fields of science and literature. [walks off as he smacks SpongeBob with his tail]
SpongeBob: Uhh, somebody went? [crowd of people are angry and go back to playing in the water] No, don't go! [SpongeBob screams whenever the fish are doing "dangerous" things in the water such as Harold splashing water at Annette, Frank water skiing with two female fish above him, two children playing catch the ball while inside a killer whale's mouth, and Frank the muscular fish hitting Scooter's head on a rock. He screams and then brings out an ice cream cart] Free ice cream! [everyone runs out of the water again and crowds around the cart] Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... okay, everybody got one? [everyone in the crowd eats their ice cream and sweet treats] A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming. [shows a clock. Everyone stops smiling] But just so you're not tempted... [ties everyone up with yellow "do not cross" tape including Scooter who is about to go surfing. He makes a bow-shaped knot after he's done tying everyone up] Ladies and gentlemen, uh, the lagoon is closed.
Scooter: We like Larry better!
SpongeBob: Does Larry ever give you [speaks into megaphone] free ice cream? [Patrick bursts out of a port-o-potty]
Patrick: Ice cream! [starts running around] Did somebody say [has a tissue paper behind his pants] ice cream? [runs up to the tape] Where is it? Is it here? [the words "do not cross" on the tape change into "ice cream"] Huh? Ice cream! Yay! [he laughs heartily and he breaks through the tape and runs into the lagoon but suddenly he gets an ache in his rear-end] Cramp! Ah! Ah! [he holds his behind then he begins to struggle in the water]
Frank: [notices Patrick struggling in the water] Holy cow! Somebody's drowning!
SpongeBob: [lounging at the top of the lifeguard tower] Oh, no, that's not possible. The lagoon is closed. [tied up group of fish angrily walk over to the tower]
Scooter: Dude, get your butt in the water!
SpongeBob: If there was anyone in there, we'd hear them.
Patrick: Help, help! [SpongeBob stands up and takes off his shades] I can't swim!
SpongeBob: Somebody would be screaming that they're drowning.
Patrick: I'm drowning! I'm drowning!
SpongeBob:  They would have to have crossed the line.
Patrick: I'm drowning ‘cause I crossed the line!
SpongeBob: [Looks at the angry fish. He takes out a pair of binoculars] Okay, I'll take a look, but just to prove to you that... [SpongeBob's eyes become huge and break through the lenses of the binoculars] ...Patrick isn't drowning! [SpongeBob sees Patrick drowning]
Patrick: Can't swim! Butt hurts! Ice cream! [SpongeBob jumps off the tower]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick! [runs to the shore, flailing his arms rapidly] I'm coming! [approaches the shore but stops to avoid touching the water]
Patrick: Help, help!
SpongeBob: Don't move! [gets a life preserver] Catch this! [throws it out to Patrick, but only lands about a foot out into the water]
Harold: Quit fooling around, man. Get in the water.
Patrick: Help, help!
SpongeBob: Oh, what am I going to do? Got to think. [starts running in circles] Gotta think. Gotta run around and think. Gotta run around and think at the same time. Gotta think, gotta have a plan. Gotta think, think, think. [the shape of his body turns into a light-bulb] I've got it! [takes out a straw] Patrick can't drown if there isn't any water! [sets straw in water and starts to suck out all the water, he grows huge] Well, you're safe now, Patrick.
Patrick: [inside SpongeBob] Help, I'm drowning! I've got butt cramps! I want ice cream and now it’s dark! [SpongeBob spits all the water out. Patrick is drowning again] Help, help! Help me, I'm drowning! Help! [SpongeBob runs to a couple sitting in a boat, about to share a hot dog]
Gus: To us. [he and Nancy are about to bite their hotdog when SpongeBob takes their boat and runs off. They make an angry look.]
SpongeBob: [comes back to return their hotdog] Sorry! Here's your hot dog. [hands them back their hot dog, then runs off and paddles the boat in the lagoon over to Patrick] Okay, Patrick, here I come! [Patrick is still flailing and screaming] Come, come round, Pat. Here I am. [Patrick grabs the boat and starts tearing it apart in a desperate frenzy. SpongeBob ushers him to stop, but the boat is torn completely into pieces and SpongeBob is in the water, too]
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [Both him and SpongeBob start struggling in the water, Patrick pushes SpongeBob underwater trying to stay afloat. Then he starts hitting SpongeBob with an anchor]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Help! Help us! We're drowning! [everyone who is tied up walks off whistling]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick!
Patrick: Goodbye, ice cream! [the two continue to struggle, Larry walks up behind them and picks them up, revealing that the water is very shallow, and only up to his ankles]
Larry: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Larry?
Larry: You're not a lifeguard, are you?
SpongeBob: No, Larry.
Larry: [carrying SpongeBob and Patrick in his hands] Let's go, guys. [later, SpongeBob and Patrick are paddling in a kiddie pool] Very good. You fellas are learning fast.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ow! Butt cramps!
Patrick: And I still don't have my ice cream.



[scene starts with Squidward leaving his house on a bicycle while he hums a tune.]
Squidward: There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go. [starts riding his bicycle to work and passes a tall piece of stalk with a treehouse on top of it with SpongeBob and Patrick in it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling]
SpongeBob: Wey, wook. It's Widward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
SpongeBob: Widward's woing to work.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
Squidward: [growls]
Patrick: Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
Squidward: What's that supposed to be— some kind of stupid secret code?
SpongeBob: We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.
Squidward: Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron? [laughs] Moron... [laughs again] as a requirement. [laughs again]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!
Squidward: Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!
Patrick: [whispering to SpongeBob] What did he say?
SpongeBob: [whispering to Patrick] I don't know. Something about his nose?
Patrick: [sticks his head out of the "Clubhouse" and talks to Squidward] Squidward, you and your nose will definitely NOT fit in.
Squidward: Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in? [takes off his hat and starts to climb up the "Clubhouse"] Why, you should be begging me to join!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!
[Squidward grunts as he tries to get in the "Clubhouse"]
Squidward: Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!
Patrick: That's what we've been trying to tell you!
SpongeBob: We've been stuck up here for three days.
Patrick: We told you you wouldn't fit in.
Squidward: [sneers]
SpongeBob: Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?
Patrick: Ready!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing] Welcome to our club! Welcome to our club! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squid...!
Squidward: SHUT YOUR HALF-WIT PIEHOLES!!! [grabs a stalk beside the one holding up the "Clubhouse" and pulls it while the other one is going down] I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club! [gets to the floor but the stalk snaps and the stalk holding up the "Clubhouse" flings back very fast and the "Clubhouse" flies off it. He starts screaming]
Nancy: Whoa!
Frank: Make a wish, honey.
[Squidward continues screaming. The "Clubhouse" falls into the Kelp Forest]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again! [they victory screech]
Squidward: Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!
Patrick: What happened?
[SpongeBob shrugs. Squidward runs around the "Clubhouse"]
Squidward: Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!
[SpongeBob and Patrick wave at Squidward who starts crying]
Squidward: Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery?!?! WHY-Y-Y-T?!
SpongeBob: Cheer up, Squidward, it could be worse.
Patrick: Yeah, you could be bald and have a big nose.
[camera zooms in on Squidward's head which deflates]
Squidward: Well... this is the end. [head falls on the ground]
SpongeBob: No it's not, Squidward!
Patrick: [building coffins] It's not?
SpongeBob: Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine! [patting Squidward's head] As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they do the victory screech again]
SpongeBob: And besides, we have this! [pulls out a conch shell]
Squidward: What's that?
Patrick: Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!
SpongeBob: Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? [pulls the string attached to the Magic Conch]
Magic Conch: Maybe someday.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling] Oooohhhh!
Squidward: You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.
Patrick: The shell knows all!
SpongeBob: Oh, Magic Conch Shell. What do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?
Magic Conch: Nothing.
Patrick: The shell has spoken!
Squidward: Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down doing nothing]
Squidward: [growls] I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!
[SpongeBob and Patrick still do nothing]
Squidward: [growls again] All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity! [starts walking away in the Kelp Forest] But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns... [laughs] sad... [laughs again] clowns. [laughs again. Later, he began to run fast and grew scared and started panting rapidly] What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost! [trips and falls] Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here! [sees light] Huh? Hhahahahahahaahhaa!! [he goes toward the light] I'm FREE!! Take that SpongeBob and Patrick!! Ahahaha!! Ahahaha!! [pumps fists in the air triumphantly but sees SpongeBob and Patrick; falls on the ground] Ohhh, there's no way out of here... [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick still doing nothing. A stick is thrown at Patrick's head. Squidward is putting a pan over a fire] How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight? [spots a bug running around so he steps on it] Ah... [puts the bug on the pan and walks over to SpongeBob and waves the pan over his nose] Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days. [walks over to Patrick] How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any. [walks away from Patrick] And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell! [shakes his butt in SpongeBob's face] If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam... [moves back to Club Squidward] that tells you nothing. [stirs the pan] As if the answers to all your problems will fall right out of the sky. Hahaha, fall right out of the sky! [camera switches to an airplane falling out of the sky]
Scooter: DUDE! We're falling right out the sky! We gotta drop the load! [presses the "Drop the Load" button. The airplane drops picnic supplies to where SpongeBob and Patrick are]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Praise the Magic Conch! [victory screech. Squidward stares shockingly. The bug gets up, hits him with the stick, and runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick eat. SpongeBob eats two hamburgers. Patrick eating a whole turkey in one bite. Now, when SpongeBob and Patrick are drinking, SpongeBob is drinking a can of soda and Patrick is drinking a bottle of ketchup. They laugh and Squidward goes to them]
Squidward: Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.
SpongeBob: It's a gift from the Magic Conch.
Squidward: Everything sure looks delicious. [gasps] Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite! [smells them but Patrick sucks them in and Squidward's nose too. He pulls his nose out] Uh, hey, uh, [laughs] SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um... [stammers] [While he is saying all this, SpongeBob is eating a cookie and is drinking a glass of orange juice]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: Umm...uh..yeah?
SpongeBob: Once a member, always a member!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [clink glasses] To the club! [victory screech]
Squidward: Yeah. [mimics the victory screech, weakly] Now, uh, if you'll excuse me... [runs to the table with all the food] All right... what shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?
SpongeBob: Why don't you ask... the magic conch, Squidward?
Squidward: Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.
[Squidward prepares to eat but SpongeBob and Patrick pull the table away and block it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.
Patrick: [whispering] Maybe he's not a brother.
[SpongeBob looks at Squidward wide-eyed]
Squidward: [chuckles] Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic. [takes the Magic Conch from SpongeBob] Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?
Magic Conch: Neither.
Squidward: Oh. Then how about the soup?
Magic Conch: I don't think so.
Squidward: [becomes annoyed] Could I have anything to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!
Patrick: [takes Magic Conch] Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch: No.
Patrick: Hmm... [happily] Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch: Yes.
Patrick: All right! [vacuums in the sandwich and burps] Sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: Give me that! [takes Magic Conch] Could I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Could I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Could I have something to eat!?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Can't you say anything else but no?!
Magic Conch: Try asking again.
Squidward: [asks excitedly with a grin on his face] Can I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: [in a very insulting, sarcastic-like tone] No!
[Squidward starts getting enraged.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you all right?
[Squidward shakes his head uncontrollably.]
Patrick: Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.
Kelp Forest Ranger: [offscreen] Hello? Anyone there? Hello? HELLO?! [he reveals himself after he cuts through the kelp. He gasps and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward dirty] Do you folks need some help?
Squidward: [gasps] I'm saved! [runs over to the forest ranger] You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!
Kelp Forest Ranger: Magic... Conch... Shell? [pulls out a Magic Conch Shell] You mean like this?! [says this while cross-eyed and having two big teeth]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they jump but they stop in midair] The Magic Conch! A club member!
Kelp Forest Ranger: [victory screech]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [victory screech]
Squidward: [dumbstruck] Uhhbuuuhhh...
Kelp Forest Ranger: My conch told me to come save you guys.
SpongeBob, Patrick and Kelp Forest Ranger: Hooray for the magic conches!
Kelp Forest Ranger: [we see Squidward in the background looking unhappy] All right, Magic Conch. What do we do now?
Magic Conch: Nothing.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger: All hail the Magic Conch! [they sit down doing nothing. Squidward, still dumbstruck, moves in between them]
Squidward: All hail the magic conch! [sits down with SpongeBob, Patrick, and the Kelp Forest Ranger]

es:El club de Bob Esponja (Transcripción)


Narrator: Ah, springtime in Bikini Bottom. All sea creatures have an innate sense of the seasonal changes... [Patrick jumps out of his rock with a purple sweater on] ...like the starfish. A quick survey of his environment... [scratches his back] ...and he knows that...
Patrick: It's spring!
Narrator: The starfish then sheds his winter coat [takes his sweater off] and stores it away safe for winter. [buries the sweater in the sand]
SpongeBob: [walks outside and smells the air] I'd better call the doctor, 'cuz I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers. [sniffs them into his nose] Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Did you say, "Hello!" to the flowers yet?
Squidward: [sighs] ...Good morning, flowers. *hiss* [flowers hiss at him like snakes. Squidward screams and runs inside]
SpongeBob: Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers. [SpongeBob digs a hole and puts the flower in it] You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty. [turns around and grabs his container. When he turns back around, the flower is half eaten. He plants a new flower. When he turns around and grabs the container of water, he sees the flower is eaten again] Huh? [plants a new one] I'm not taking my eyes off you. [eyes stretch out staring at the flower]
Narrator: Three days later...
[SpongeBob is still staring, but his eyes have shriveled up. He uses the water to make his eyes normal]
Patrick: [running by] Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [turns around] Hi, Patrick! [when SpongeBob turns back around, the flower is eaten again] How does this keep happening?? [notices a seahorse eating the flower next to him] Hi. [horse neighs then gallops onto a rock] She's beautiful! [SpongeBob imagines riding the seahorse with a head full of wavy hair] What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish? [scene cuts to seahorse eating some flowers and SpongeBob looking at her from a distance writing in a book] Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic... perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty... or Debbie. [seahorse neighs] She must have spotted my floral bookmark! [using a flower bookmark in his book. Mystery gallops over slowly] She's coming this way. That's it, girl... don't be afraid... I'm just a talking sponge, is all... [Mystery sniffs the bookmark and then eats it. Scene cuts to SpongeBob riding with Mystery, blowing a bubble heart, posting for Mystery, making stamp books, and walking out of a store laughing with hats. Scene cuts to nighttime in SpongeBob's bed where SpongeBob is sleeping on the floor and Mystery is in SpongeBob's bed] Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever? [Mystery is asleep] I'll take that as a yes!
Squidward: [it's now morning as Squidward rides his bike. SpongeBob and Mystery gallop by him] What the...?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Still riding a machine to work I see.
Squidward: Don't say anything, Squidward, remember your karma. [Squidward's bike trips on something and he falls off a cliff, then explodes. He groans. SpongeBob arrives at the Krusty Krab and ties Mystery to a bike rack]
SpongeBob: Whoa, girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift. [walks in as Scooter and Wobbles walk by]
Scooter: Hey, look! Mr. Krabs put in a kiddie ride!
Wobbles: [Southern accent] Why doncha try it out? [Scooter gets out a quarter]
Scooter: I can't find the coin slot. Here it is! [Scooter finds the coin slot but Mystery kicks Scooter into the background and he explodes]
Wobbles: [runs off; screams; still in Southern drawl] HELP! Kiddie ride on the loose!
Mr. Krabs: [walks out] What's with all the ruckus!? [gasps] A monster scaring away me customers!
SpongeBob: That's not a monster, Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery.
Mr. Krabs: ...You're a mystery, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob laughs] Get rid of it.
SpongeBob: Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow!
Mr. Krabs: It's either you or Mystery.
SpongeBob: I knew I should've named her Debbie. [scene cuts to SpongeBob, sad, grilling up some patties]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!
SpongeBob: [in a sad voice] You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now, if we could only get rid of Squidward. [laughs then walks out]
SpongeBob: Good one, sir. [takes his pair of sad eye contacts off] Hah! It worked, girl. [opens the cabinet with Mystery inside it] We'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build. [scene cuts to Patrick sitting down with a board on his forehead, doing absolutely nothing] Only eight more hours. [closes cupboards]
Narrator: Twelve seconds later... [Mystery peeks out of the cupboard]
SpongeBob: No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job. [SpongeBob gives her a tray with a patty on it] Wait a second. I bet you're hungry. How ‘bout some lunch? [Mystery eats the patty and neighs] Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob closes the cabinet quickly as Mr. Krabs comes bursting in] What was that? Is that horse in here?!
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs. I was just practicing my imitation of Mystery... wheesnoff.
Mr. Krabs: Well, keep working on it! That was terrible! [walks out]
SpongeBob: That was close. [gets a tray with three patties] From now on, no more hijinks. Order up! [puts the tray on the window. Mystery eats it. Squidward walks up to the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob, where's my order?
SpongeBob: Did you look under the tray?
Squidward: No I didn't, sorry. [looks under the tray then sighs] SpongeBob, could you just get my order?
SpongeBob: They vanished! Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next?! I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE! [runs to the door]
Squidward: SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!
SpongeBob: Oh?
Squidward: [Mystery approaches a customer's Krabby Patty] In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, [SpongeBob notices Mystery] you cook the food, then the customer gets the food. [SpongeBob's eyes move to the side of his face. Squidward is still talking] We do that for forty years and then we die. [Mystery eats a Krabby Patty and she burps] Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say? 
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back. [grabs Mystery and shoves her under a cupboard]
Squidward: What's that?
SpongeBob: Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control! [closes the cupboard] Now then, you were saying?
Squidward: Just get my order. [walks out]
SpongeBob: You got it, Squidward? [chuckles] Ghosts. [Mystery eats SpongeBob's Krusty Krab work hat] Mystery, you ate my hat. [Mystery burps out a spatula] Mystery, you ate my spatula. You ate all the Krabby Patties! You ate the stove! You ate Old Man Jenkins!!!
Old Man Jenkins: [from inside Mystery's belly] I don't want to be a burden.
Squidward: [customers yelling...] Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen.
Thaddeus: Where's our food?
Fred: I'm so hungry!
Tina: This is my only lunch hour!
Tom: Where's Old Man Jenkins?!
Squidward: Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, what's goin' on in here?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask Cowbob Ranchpants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot.
Mr. Krabs: [runs into the kitchen] SpongeBob! What's the meaning of all these nicknames!?! [his eyes bug out] DAVID H. JONES! [SpongeBob is by Mystery's side, who has eaten too much]
SpongeBob: Mystery got a bellyache from eating Krabby Patties. So I made her a bicarbonate of soda. [Mystery spits out Old Man Jenkins]
Old Man Jenkins: *burp* What did I miss? [Mr. Krabs takes out his eyes, blows on them, rubs them, and puts them back on]
Mr. Krabs: So, my eyes are correct! You still have that horse even when I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs. Please don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend. [Mystery licks SpongeBob's cheek. Squidward cries because of a bowl of onions near him]
Squidward: Hey, who left this bowl of onions here!?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] You do?
Mr. Krabs: I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together.
SpongeBob: What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [sniffles] And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda! [sobbing] My best friend! [crying] [Squidward cries because of the onions again]
Squidward: What? Would you get out of here?
Mr. Krabs: The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard. [points to Mystery] Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse. [two customers spit out their patties]
SpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.
Nat Peterson: [crying because of the bowl of onions Squidward is holding under his nose] Hey!
SpongeBob: Okay, girl, you're free to go. [takes Mystery outside and takes Mystery's leash off] I can't keep you anymore. [cries] I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild. [Mystery gallops away] Well, what are you waiting for!? Can't you see I don't want you anymore! [now begins bawling harder by a huge shot, as Patrick walks up with the board on his head] JUST GET OUT OF HERE, YOU STUPID DUMB ANIMAL! [resumes wailing intensely, Patrick walks away as Mr. Krabs walks up to SpongeBob] Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again.
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.
Squidward: Hey, Mr. Krabs! Looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad! [vault of money opens to show dollar bills that have been eaten and a bunch of money is missing]
Mr. Krabs: Get that horse! [He and SpongeBob run after Mystery.] 
SpongeBob: Mystery!
Mr. Krabs: Come back!
SpongeBob: Mystery! Wheesnoff!
Both: Mystery, come back here!
[The scene cuts to Patrick, who is trying to enter a hat shop, but the board nailed to his head keeps bumping him repeatedly as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]

 
[At Mrs. Puff's Boating School, SpongeBob is arranging his pencils on his desk.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, miss?
Nancy: I don't want to have to report you again.
SpongeBob: [laughs] I was just wondering... [points to the 'Homework' pencil while the other two pencils say 'Quiz' and 'Essay'] ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or...
Nancy: I think it goes stuck inside your...
SpongeBob: Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil [moves the pencil] and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad, [turns it sideways] just in case I have to write an essay.
Mrs. Puff: [walks in] Good morning class. Sorry I'm late. I got caught in traffic on the way in here when that whole 'I'm-going-to-be-doing-this-for-the-rest-of-my-life' thing reared its ugly head and I... [Everyone stares at her blankly] Anyway, we have a new student starting today, so let's all put on a happy face for Flats the flounder. [opens the door to show a skinny flounder from the front but when he turns sideways, he's large. The entire class, except SpongeBob, has paper faces, painted with faces, on] Tell the class something about yourself, Flats.
Flats: Well, I like to kick people's butts.
Mrs. Puff: [laughs] What a card! Now Flats, it's time to pick your seat. Just go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like. [the class move their desks away from the middle of the room, except SpongeBob. Flats sits in the empty seat next to him] Okay class, as you remember last week...
SpongeBob: [to Flats] Hi! I'm SpongeBob!
Flats: Hi, SpongeBob. I'm gonna kick your butt.
SpongeBob: [gasps, then laughs] That joke was almost funnier the second time.
Flats: [leans over SpongeBob menacingly] No. I mean it.
SpongeBob: [giggles] That time it almost seemed like... [Flats rips off his his chest hair to show 'I Mean It'. Horror-struck] ...you did mean it. [raises hand] Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Can I be excused for the rest of my life? [Mrs. Puff chuckles]
Mrs. Puff: Why no, SpongeBob. I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now. You can't afford to miss this information.
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff. [puts his hand down] Sorry, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board? How about you, Flats? [Flats approaches the board] Please draw for us a diagram of a basic four-way intersection, Flats. [draws an image on the board] Please turn and show the class what you drew, honey. [has drawn pictures of SpongeBob being beat up; SpongeBob yelps] My, how very creative! We have an artist in the class. [everyone applauds, except SpongeBob. Cut to SpongeBob running in the halls and into the bathroom. He hides in one of the toilets]
SpongeBob: I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy! [cut back to SpongeBob saying "Hi! I'm SpongeBob!" SpongeBob counts on his fingers] One... two... [gasps] OH NO! THAT'S THREE! What am I going to do? [hears the door open] What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural. [Martin opens the lid and sees a real sponge]
Martin: Oh, that's real nice. [walks out]
SpongeBob: Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be... [Flats opens the stall] Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings. [Flats looks dumbfounded] Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings! [giggles]
Flats: Hey, that story really speaks to me.
SpongeBob: Really? What's it say?
Flats: It says now, I'm gonna kick your butt twice as hard. [Leaves. SpongeBob flushes the toilet, making water spray out of his holes. Cut to later where SpongeBob is walking down the hall writing on a clipboard]
SpongeBob: ...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this. [the school phone rings and SpongeBob picks it up] Death row, next in line speaking.
Patrick: [over phone] Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery.
SpongeBob: Patrick? Is that you? [cut back to Patrick's rock]
Patrick: Yeah, hey Mario. Let me get a large double olive, double- [cut back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help!
Patrick: [over phone] You're working at Pizza Castle now?
SpongeBob: What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up.
Patrick: [over phone] No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you there?
Patrick: [over phone] Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats. [SpongeBob is horror-struck. Cut to Patrick's rock where Flats is sitting on the couch enjoying a beverage] I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny? [cut back to SpongeBob] It must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt! [SpongeBob drops the phone and runs away screaming] Hellllo? Is this Pizza Castle?! [cut to Mrs. Puff's room where SpongeBob is still heard screaming then smashes into the door]
Mrs. Puff: Come in, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class?
Mrs. Puff: But why?
SpongeBob: I can't tell you.
Mrs. Puff: Why ever not?
SpongeBob: I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that.
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, you can tell me anything. You've got to believe that.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us.
Mrs. Puff: Of course.
SpongeBob: Flats says he's going to kick my butt!
Mrs. Puff: What?! There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine. This is an adult program. SpongeBob, just leave it to me!
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you. [cut to SpongeBob eating a sandwich outside. The bell rings and everyone goes back in the classroom]
Mrs. Puff: Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob? [walks in the classroom]
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: [whispers] SpongeBob, I talked to Flats for you. I used your name. It was all a misunderstanding.
SpongeBob: YOU WHAT?!?!?!
Mrs. Puff: He was never going to kick your butt at all! You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend. [Flats makes a SpongeBob out of sand and kicks it] And maybe play some sports with you on weekends.
SpongeBob: I've got diarrhea! [runs off and sees an older flounder in a boat] Huh? Are you Flats' dad?
Flats' Dad: Why, yes I am.
SpongeBob: Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt. [Flats is by the boat]
Flats: Dad, what're you doing?
Flats' Dad: Uhh, nothing, son.
Flats: What did I tell you about talking to strangers?
Flats' Dad: [to SpongeBob] Now he's gonna kick my butt!
SpongeBob: [screams and runs away] AAAAAAAHHH! OUT OF MY WAY! OUT OF MY WAY! [points] Can't you see he's going to kick my butt?! [a bunch of fish look over to an older fish at a bus stop]
Lonnie: Hi there, young people, nice day today.
Harold: So, you like kicking butts, do ya?! Well, we'll show you, old man! [the fish start beating up on Lonnie while SpongeBob is hiding in a garbage can]
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! "BobPants SpongeSquare". Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after. [Flats is behind him driving a dump truck]
Flats: Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt! [SpongeBob gasps three times and runs off while still in the garbage can. As he is running down the road, trash falls out of the garbage can, including a banana peel. Flats shrieks when he sees the banana peel on the ground. When the dump truck runs over the peel, it flips upside down. Cut to later where Flats is in a hospital]
SpongeBob: Hey, Flats... you feeling better?
Flats: What? Where am I?
Purple Doctorfish: [walks in] Why, you're in the hospital. This young boy saved your life. He performed CPR for five hours straight.
SpongeBob: Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure.
Flats: Wow, I'm touched. I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt. [SpongeBob is thunderstruck, accompanied with glass shattering] Those flowers for me?
SpongeBob: [screaming as he runs out of the hospital] AAAAAAAHHH! He's still gonna kick my butt! [the fish look at Lonnie again]
Harold: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?!
Lonnie: I love the young people. [the fish walks up to the old fish. Cut to SpongeBob running back to his house]
SpongeBob: Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do! [cut to SpongeBob in an office building at a desk, on the phone] Hang on, I'll transfer your call. [cut back to a knock on the door] Who is it! [door falls down. SpongeBob sees Flats and screams] 'AHH!!! Flats!!
Flats: It's butt-kicking time.
SpongeBob: Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is! [Flats cracks his knuckles more and more. SpongeBob breaths harder and harder. Flats brushes his teeth and gargles. SpongeBob breathes harder]
Flats: Let's do it!
SpongeBob: Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly. [Gary gets out a camera from his shell]
Flats: Are you ready?
SpongeBob: Hold on. [puts a blindfold over his eyes] Okay, I'm ready. [Flats punches SpongeBob but it doesn't hurt SpongeBob] I said I'm ready. [Flats tries again but same result happens] Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready. [Flats punches him again and this time SpongeBob giggles] That tickles! [Flats keeps punching him but nothing seems to hurt SpongeBob] Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of... spongy material! Do you know what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow! [cut to next day where SpongeBob is in the Krusty Krab kitchen, grilling, and Flats is still punching SpongeBob, then scene cuts to him playing cards with Gary, chasing jellyfish, walking out of the bathroom, sleeping, and eating breakfast. Cut to boating school as SpongeBob is sitting at his desk and Flats is punching, but not as hard. He passes out from punching too much] Flats, are you okay? [everyone cheers] Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call... [clenches fist] ...'violence road'. [Mrs Puff walks in]
Mrs. Puff: Sorry I'm late, class, I... [gasps as she sees SpongeBob's fist and Flats on the ground] SpongeBob! I can't believe you beat up a new student! [zoom out of school] I'm going to kick your butt!

 
Narrator:  Oh, a dark and stormy night. It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed a health inspector. [laughs evilly. Stormy night becomes calm day] It was a bright and sunny morning. [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where a fish drives up and stops in front of the restaurant. The scene zooms into his badge that reads 'Health Inspector']
Mr. Krabs: [Taking a bath in money] Ah...That smells like... [gasps] ...the health inspector! [Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob in a yellow towel] Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here! [both are peeking out the kitchen window at the health inspector, who is writing on a clipboard] If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry. [eyes widen] The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.
Mr. Krabs: You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son? [pushes SpongeBob out the door] Just go out there and give him what he needs; pour on the charm. Sweet talk him. [SpongeBob walks up to the health inspector, who is still writing on his clipboard at the table]
SpongeBob: What can I get for you... handsome?
Mr. Krabs: [facepalms] We're doomed.
Health Inspector Yellowtail: I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.
SpongeBob: [walking backwards back into the kitchen] Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up! [SpongeBob enters the kitchen, where Krabs waits] He wants one of everything.
Mr. Krabs: Then we'll give him a smorgasbord! [holds up a tray of a patty, a drink, some fries, and coral bits] The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run up to the health inspector]
SpongeBob: Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir! [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven. [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
SpongeBob: The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite. [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Fresh Sludge Pudding? [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
SpongeBob: More Diet Red Tide? [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Some Fried Flotsam? [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Health Inspector: Please, gentlemen! [swallows all the food in his mouth] Leave me to finish my work in peace. [clicks his pen, which is actually a fork that comes out. Later, the health inspector has eaten everything on the table and belches]
SpongeBob: And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
Health Inspector: [writes on his clipboard] So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.
SpongeBob: [open kitchen door] He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear! [both dance off then leapfrog over each other across the screen, then do the can-can in dresses until a news report comes on TV]
Realistic Fish Head: We interrupt this can-can for a special news bulletin. Be on the lookout for a man, who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food. That's all for now. [Mr. Krabs gets angry]
Mr. Krabs: [Yells] FRRRRREEEEEEE FOOOOOOOOOD?!?!?!
SpongeBob: Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.
Mr. Krabs: You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!
SpongeBob: Duped!
Mr. Krabs: Bamboozled!
SpongeBob: We've been smeckledorfed!
Mr. Krabs: That's not even a word, and I agree with ya! [both look through the kitchen window at the health inspector, who is wiping his mouth off, finishing his drink, and cleaning his teeth with a toothpick] Look at him, I bet he never changes his underpants.
SpongeBob: I bet he bites whale bubbles.
Mr. Krabs: I bet his mom bought him that hat. [holds up a Krabby Patty] If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one. [flicks the top bun off and puts a some volcano sauce on the patty] You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!
SpongeBob: It doesn't seem right... [holds up a bottle of seahorse radish] ...but it feels so good! [dumps a spoonful on the patty] Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean. 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hold on, I've got a jar of toenail clippings in my office! [runs off as SpongeBob drops the patty in the toilet]
SpongeBob: Oops, I dropped it in the toilet! [Mr. Krabs runs in with a smelly sock]
Mr. Krabs: Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks! [scene cuts to showing a disgusting Krabby Patty with what appears to be a pimpled bun and green meat] Why, that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned! [both are wearing clothespins on their noses]
SpongeBob: I call it the 'Nasty Patty'. [both laugh]
Health Inspector: Hey, hurry up with that patty! [SpongeBob runs in with the patty]
SpongeBob: [speaking quickly] Here you are, sir, enjoy. [runs back into the kitchen]
Health Inspector: Ah, hello, delicious. Come to papa. [as he is about to eat it, a fly flies into his throat, choking him]
Mr. Krabs: [listening from the kitchen] Listen, he ate it! [both look out from the kitchen window] Oh, look at him choke! [both laugh] Look at him suffer! [both keep laughing.] Did you see that, boy? Oh man, that look on his face. [Health inspector slips on some packets of condiments and bangs his head on the table, knocking him out. The fly exits his mouth. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are still laughing. Another TV bulletin comes on]
Realistic Fish Head: We interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash! The fake inspector has been captured! Here is his picture. [picture is shown on the TV] If a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy, he's real.
SpongeBob: Phew! That's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] I don't think he'll be laughin', boy...
SpongeBob: Why, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Because that patty killed him! [both scream, check the inspector again, then shriek again]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do!?
Mr. Krabs: What's this "we" stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!
SpongeBob: But you told me to give it to him!
Mr. Krabs: Well, you could've talked me out of it!
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me. [Mr. Krabs grabs him]
Mr. Krabs: Get a hold of yourself, boy! We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it. We've got to take it out and bury it. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs on a muddy hill.] 
SpongeBob: [disgusted] Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpse-y! [gagging and shrieking while constantly spraying it with disinfectant] Eww... eww... [SpongeBob is dragging the body by a tissue]
Mr. Krabs: This should be far enough. Now, get diggin'! [hands SpongeBob a shovel]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. [while digging a big hole, his shovel hits something]
Mr. Krabs: What's the holdup down there?
SpongeBob: There's a big rock in the way!
Mr. Krabs: Well, toss it out and get back to diggin'!
SpongeBob: [salutes] Aye aye, sir! [grunting as he tosses the huge rock behind him]
Health Inspector: Oh... where am I? [grunts as the rock hits him in the head knocking him out again, groans]
Mr. Krabs: Somethin' ain't quite right.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Mr. Krabs? [health inspector's head is out of the ground]
Mr. Krabs: His head's stickin' out!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob covers his head with more sand] Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I thought he might need some air.
Mr. Krabs: They don't need air where he's goin'.
SpongeBob: Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uh...
SpongeBob: [bawling] What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that! Why... why... why?! [Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean no one can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me. And worst of all, it'll be the end of me!
Officer Malley: [shines a flashlight on them] Stop right where you are! I'm afraid we're going to have to arrest the two of you. [SpongeBob hangs on Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail! [Mr. Krabs covers his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: And what would be the charges?
Officer Malley: For not being at the Krusty Krab to whip us up a couple of dee-licious Krabby Patties! [both police officers laugh. Mr. Krabs laughs nervously]
Mr. Krabs: Laugh, boy. [SpongeBob laughs. It rains. The rain washes away the dirt burying the health inspector and he slides down the hill]
Officer Nancy: Put that muddy shovel in the trunk and we'll give you a ride back. [SpongeBob is still laughing until Mr. Krabs hits him. Mr. Krabs opens the trunk and SpongeBob puts the shovel in it]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, listen carefully: We're just getting a lift back to the Krusty Krab. I need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool, understand? [SpongeBob looks down and goes in shock]
SpongeBob: Can I lose my cool now?
Mr. Krabs: Why? [SpongeBob points to the health inspector, who has now slid down the hill. Both scream, Mr. Krabs grabs the body and gives it to SpongeBob] Put him in the trunk, boy! I'll keep them cops busy.
Officer Malley: What's the holdup back there? [Mr. Krabs starts talking to him as a distraction]
SpongeBob: Oh, Neptune! Get away! [throws the inspector in the trunk then sprays himself with disinfectant.] Ooh...ahh-ahh... [Slams the trunk on the health inspector, who was waking up] A-hem... Okay! All set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk. [laughs nervously]
Mr. Krabs: All set. [SpongeBob slides in almost motionlessly]
SpongeBob: Ahh... [starts to shake]
Officer Nancy: You okay there, little fella?
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, he gets carsick real easy.
Officer Malley: Well, buckle up and we'll drive real smooth-like. [drives off]
Mr. Krabs: Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab I want you to take that [winks] shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...er... I mean, stow it in the freezer. Un-der-stand?
SpongeBob: I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo... [is about to say "body"]
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob's lips] ...ttles of soda! Bottles of soda, same thing, put 'em in the freezer. [Nancy stares at them funny. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is bringing the body to the back]
SpongeBob: Oh, man, this is so gross! [tries to open the door, but there is a lock] The back door is locked! What am I gonna do?! [scene cuts to inside the Krusty Krab with Mallay and Nancy laughing. SpongeBob enters with a big hat where the health inspector is in it]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there, SpongeBob. Heh. I thought you were out back taking care of that [angrily] shovel! [twitches and winks his eyes]
SpongeBob: Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here...eh. [his hat sags over, and SpongeBob puts it back in position] So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go put my hat in the freezer now. [walks to the kitchen very carefully]
Mr. Krabs: Okey-dokey, SpongeBob.
Officer Malley: Is that kid okay?
Officer Nancy: He's actin' a little funny.
Mr. Krabs: Funny? Oh. Yeah. [laughs] He's a real cut-up, that one. He knows how to keep the crew in stitches. Good one, boy! Always on, that one. There's no "off" on his funny switch. [laughs, SpongeBob stumbles with the Health Inspector in his hat as Malley, Nancy, and Mr. Krabs look on] Oh, ah, oh stop it. Oh, you're, you're killin' me. [laughs, SpongeBob is trying to get through a door but his hat is too big. Mr. Krabs bangs the cash drawer open] Oh! Look, I almost forgot! It's Open Cash Register Night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register! [hands out the money. SpongeBob gets his hat inside the kitchen]
Officer Malley: [listens to his walkie-talkie] 86 those patties, Krabs. We just got a call about two ghouls burying a stiff over by Shallow Grave Road.
Officer Nancy: I want a soda. [Mr. Krabs gives her one]
Mr. Krabs: Here's your soda. Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now.
Officer Nancy: Hey, there's no ice.
Mr. Krabs: [nervous] Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want, you want ice? Is that what you want? [SpongeBob slides on screen]
SpongeBob: The dark deed you requested is done, sir.
Officer Nancy: [walks to the kitchen] I'll get it myself. Ice is in the freezer, ri...? [Mr. Krabs runs to block the freezer door]
Mr. Krabs: THERE IS NO ICE! THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ICE! ICE IS JUST A MYTH!!!
Officer Nancy: Step aside. You people act like you've committed a murder!
Mr. Krabs: Okay! I confess! [points to SpongeBob] SpongeBob killed him!
SpongeBob: What?! You can't pin this whole rap on me!
Mr. Krabs: He was insane, out of control. He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along.
SpongeBob: It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.
Mr. Krabs: Put him down now, he's a mad dog!
SpongeBob: He wears curlers to bed!
Mr. Krabs: Wait! It's not what you think!
Officer Nancy: What are you two talking about?
Mr. Krabs: We killed a health inspector! Buried him and then stuffed his body in the freezer!
Officer Nancy: You mean in here? [opens the freezer, but it's empty]
Mr. Krabs: It's empty?
Officer Nancy: Is this some kind of a joke?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah... a joke! [SpongeBob giggles]
Officer Nancy: Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out. [everyone laughs. Just then a fish walks up moaning]
SpongeBob: AHHHH!!!! IT'S A ZOMBIE!!!! [the inspector turns the lights on]
Health Inspector: You guys...
Officer Malley: [hits the inspector on the head with an anchor] TAKE THAT, ZOMBIE! [inspector now has a huge bump on his head]
Officer Nancy: I'll take it from here. [hits the inspector on the head with a barrel] DIE, ZOMBIE!
Officer Malley: Good police work, Officer Nancy. Hey, this guy's not a zombie. He's just an ordinary health inspector.
Health Inspector: Yes. And at the risk of being hit again, I'd like to present you with this. [gives Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob a note with the word "pass" on it checked]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!
Everyone: Hooray! [everyone walks out of the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! [the inspector tries to crawl out] Well, not really.
Health Inspector: Oh, boy, I'd like a Krabby Patty. [door slams in his face. Scene cuts to above water where it's stormy again]
Narrator: Well, that's the story. Yes, they are all idiots, aren't they?


SpongeBob: See anything yet, Patrick?
Patrick: I need my glasses. [puts two glasses of water on his eyes like binoculars, which are real human eyes.] Hmmm... [a mail truck approaches] ...it's the mail truck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Our package! [Patrick throws the glasses and they both start dancing and hopping]
Squidward: I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day.
Norton: SpongeBob SquarePants?
SpongeBob: That's me! [Norton throws a big box next to him and Patrick]
Squidward: That's a big box!
SpongeBob: Thank you! [still dancing and hopping]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?
SpongeBob: Thirty more seconds, Patrick. [rubs hands together]
Squidward: They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap. [laughs as SpongeBob and Patrick lift up a big-screen TV out of the box] Huh? A brand-new television?
SpongeBob: Easy... easy... [both him and Patrick throw the TV onto a trash-can]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah! [jump into the box and close the flaps]
Squidward: Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider. [walks up to the box with SpongeBob and Patrick inside] Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?
SpongeBob: [as he emerges from the box] Pretty smart, huh?
Patrick: [emerges from the box] I thought it wouldn't work.
Squidward: Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah. [yells in SpongeBob and Patrick's faces] Don't you two have any brains?!
SpongeBob: Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our... [makes a rainbow over his head with his hands] ...imagination!
Squidward: Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?
SpongeBob: With... [SpongeBob jumps on the flap of the box, makes another rainbow with his hands] ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate! [curls his finger in a hook shape] Arrrrr! A football player! [stands in a football player stance] Hup!
Patrick: A starfish!
Squidward: Patrick, you're already a starfish.
Patrick: See, Squidward? It works! You try!
Squidward: [rubs his two tentacles on both sides of his head] Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV... [points to the one on the trash-can] ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sure, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! [Squidward runs to the TV and pushes it to his house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!
Patrick: Let's play Mountain Climbing Adventure!
SpongeBob: Let's go for it! [pulls the flaps of the box over on them] Gloves!
Patrick: Check.
SpongeBob: Hats!
Patrick: Check.
SpongeBob: Underwear!
Patrick: Uh... check!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope.
Patrick: You got it! [climbing noises come from the box]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!
Squidward: I hope they put some air holes in that box. [goes inside his house]
SpongeBob: Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!
Patrick: I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo! Excelsior!
Squidward: [opens his door] Now where's that remote? [walks up to the remote, which is right next to the box. He picks it up, puts it in his shirt and stands next to the box, listening to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: I am the lizard king! Whoo!
SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!
Patrick: What should we keep down?
Squidward: Morons.
SpongeBob: Our voices!
Squidward: Will you two shut up?! [kicks the box, causing the sound of an avalanche, making SpongeBob and Patrick scream and fall, they both start to cry. Squidward is shocked] Sponge... Bob? [he softly touches the box, causing another avalanche]
Patrick: Hold me.
SpongeBob: Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!
Patrick: SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw! [Squidward begins to sweat]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I can't do that!
Patrick: Why not?
SpongeBob: Because I already cut off my own arms! [Squidward kneels down]
Patrick: Nooooo!
[Squidward quickly opens the box and looks in. SpongeBob and Patrick sit inside the box]
Squidward: [confused] What the? How were you two making that noise?
SpongeBob: [laughs] What noise, Squidward?
Patrick: I could only hear the sound of our laughter.
Squidward: Yes! But those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the...
Patrick: Don't forget the second avalanche.
Squidward: Forget it. [closes the box] I don't know why I'm wasting my time out here when I could be watching my brand new television. [helicopter sounds are heard from the box, Squidward looks around at the sky and ducks]
Pilot Inside Box: Attention climbers, please hold on! The saws are on the way!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
Squidward: Grrrr... Aha! [he opens the box again and sees SpongeBob and Patrick sitting inside the box again] How are you two doing that?
SpongeBob: First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet...
Squidward: The noises! How are you two making those noises?
Patrick: That's easy. All you need is a box.
SpongeBob: And... [makes another rainbow with his hands] ...imagination.
Squidward: [as SpongeBob and Patrick duck down into the box] Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination... [tries to make a rainbow with his hands, like SpongeBob, but is unsuccessful] ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies.
Patrick: That's good. Now all you need is a box. [closes the box]
Squidward: [walks back to his house] I'll show them! [looks in his closet] There's got to be one in here! [finds a small, round green box] Ah! This hat box should do nicely. [pulls out a Mexican sombrero] Why haven't I worn this yet? [throws it off-screen, gets in the box but he is too big for it and then just sits there. He then frowns, looks at his watch and then gets mad and kicks the box. Police sirens are heard]
Policeman Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's box: Attention! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!
Squidward: What do they want with me? What did I do? [he gasps] Obviously I violated some new boxing law! [walks out of his house showing the green box] Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!
Criminal Inside Box: You'll never take me alive, coppers!
Man Inside Box: No, Johnny! Don't do it! [Police sirens are heard. Squidward gets angry and kicks his green box toward SpongeBob and Patrick's box]
Patrick: [opens box and sirens stop] Whoopee! Another box! [Patrick takes the hat box and closes the box they're sitting in and police sirens are heard again]
Squidward: I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV. [turns on TV to see a show with boxes on a conveyor belt in a factory]
Male TV narrator: It is here that the boxes reach their final stage of assembly. [changes channel to an old professor talking about a box equation on a chalkboard]
Professor: The equation is demonstrated here by this box. [changes channel to a soap opera with a man and woman]
Man: I couldn't afford a present this year, so I got you this box. [he holds up a box]
Woman: That's what I got you! [she also holds up a box]
Squidward: Isn't there anything on that isn't about boxes?! [changes channel to a boxing match on TV]
Announcer: And welcome back to Championship Boxing.
Squidward: [chuckles in hope] Heh-heh, I guess this is okay. I mean, it's not really about boxes. [two boxes go at each other in the ring] I give up.
Astronaut Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's Box: 3... 2... 1... blast off! [a loud rocket takes off noises are heard from the box]
Squidward: [fascinated] How are they doing that? That was the most realistic space launch I ever heard! There must be an explanation. Think, Squidward, think! [he imagines SpongeBob and Patrick are giggling so much]
SpongeBob: Shh! [he grabs a tape recorder to play music with real rocket sound effects] Squidward's such a jerk. [both laugh]
Squidward: Laugh at me, will they? [opens box once again] All right, where is it?
Patrick: [comes out of Squidward's green hat box] Here I am!
SpongeBob: Where's what, Squidward?
Squidward: Don't "Where's what, Squidward?" me! Where's the tape recorder?
SpongeBob: We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!
Squidward: Don't "We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!" me!
SpongeBob: But we don't!
Patrick: [holds up a small, white, rectangular box in his hand] We have a tape recorder box.
Squidward: [takes the small, white box from Patrick and throws it offscreen] All right, make way you two, I'm coming in. [gets into box]
SpongeBob: Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S... [makes a rainbow with his hands once more] ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?
Squidward: No, no. Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe.
SpongeBob: Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is about! It's about... [makes one last rainbow with his hands] ...imagination.
Squidward: All right, fine! [as he makes the rainbow go away with his hands] Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is! [SpongeBob and Patrick close their eyes and make pirate and robot sounds]
Patrick: [imitates robot] Beep-beep-beep.
SpongeBob: [imitates pirate] Arr.
Patrick: Beep-boop-bee-boop.
SpongeBob: Ahoy matey!
Patrick: Beep-beep.
SpongeBob: For that you'll walk the plank! [SpongeBob giggles softly, and Patrick starts chuckling goofily]
Squidward: [he gets angry. he growls] Why won't this thing turn on?! [he slams the bottom of the box with his fists] All right, fine. If you don't want to show me, [gets out of the box] I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing. [Squidward paces back and forth in his house] How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that! [he hears real robot/pirate battle noises from box] Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it: when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to! [he sits in his chair until nighttime]
[firework and cheering sounds are heard coming from the box. Patrick and SpongeBob come out of the box and Patrick yawns]
Patrick: I need sleep to refuel my imagination tanks!
SpongeBob: [Squidward looks out of his window] I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots.
Patrick: Yeah, see you in the morning.
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick. [they both go into their houses]
[Squidward sneaks out of his house. He tiptoes over to the box and gets inside]
Squidward: [He chuckles mischievously and then sees a piece of paper on the side of the box] Hello, what's this? [reads] "This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh! [tears paper into pieces with anger] I've got to find that button quick! [looks around the box] It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really was their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises? [pushes his foot down and the sound of an engine revving is heard] What the...? [Squidward turns the imaginary key] It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot! [laughs] Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had! [the noises actually come from a garbage truck, which lifts the box into the other garbage]
SpongeBob: [Squidward cheering in the distance while SpongeBob is reading a book in bed with his bed posts lit like candles] Listen to that, Gary. Squidward finally made the box work after all. That's so great.
Squidward: [the garbage truck begins to drive away with the box that Squidward is in] Vroom! Vroom! Only two more laps to the finish line! [the garbage truck dumps out the trash, including the box] I'm in the lead! Out of my way! I'm almost there! [laughs as the box slides down a trash pile] Whoo-hoo-hoo! Victory is mine! [the box hits something, sending Squidward tumbling down, face first onto a cherry pie. He groans and the box falls on him. The next morning, SpongeBob and Patrick come out of their houses]
SpongeBob: Hey, our box is gone!
Patrick: Oh, well.
SpongeBob: I know! Let's go see Squidward!
Patrick: I hope he's not too down in the dumps today. [he and SpongeBob walk to Squidward's house and a timpani noise is heard in the background as the screen fades to black]


Narrator: Ahh, the Krusty Krab. Through these doors pass all the many kinds of undersea life. [two fish are about to leave]
Mermaid Man: Through the double doors! [bursts through the door, knocking the two fish away] Away!
Narrator: And also these guys. [Barnacle Boy enters the Krusty Krab]
Barnacle Boy: I told you I'm not hungry, Mermaid Man!
Mermaid Man: N-nonsense, Barnacle Boy, we've got to keep up our strength for the fight against evil!
Barnacle Boy: What a dive.
Mermaid Man: To the register! [runs to the register] Away!
Squidward: Can I help you?
Mermaid Man: A double Krabby Patty and Coral Bits for me, and a silly meal for the lad.
Barnacle Boy: It's not for the toy, I just... I've gotta fit in the tights, y'know? [he smiles nervously]
Squidward: Whatever. Five dollars, please.
Mermaid Man: You got it, bucky. [removes his left seashell cup, opens the shell up like a clutch purse and pulls out a metal nut] Will this cover it? [close up of the nut and a timpani noise is heard]
Squidward: ...No.
Barnacle Boy: [confronts Squidward] Listen, big nose, [points at Mermaid Man] that guy has been saving your butt since before you were born. Don't you got a living legend discount or something?
Squidward: This is a restaurant, not a lending library. [pokes Barnacle Boy] And who are you calling big nose, [pokes Barnacle Boy again] big nose? [both press noses against each other. Barnacle Boy gets out a $5 bill from his hat and he throws it to Squidward]
Barnacle Boy: Well, next time danger threatens, don't expect any help from us.
Squidward: [grabs the bill. Sarcastically] I'm shakin'. Heh. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
SpongeBob: [the wall next to the ordering window presses in with SpongeBob's imprint, and then SpongeBob bursts through] MERMAID MAN AND BARNACLE BOY!? MUST. GET. AUTOGRAPH. [stretches arm to pull a pen from Tom's shirt pocket and stretches second arm to grab a paper from the window]
Mermaid Man: If you wanna grow up strong like me,... [shows his fat belly, shocking Barnacle Boy] you gotta leave room for seconds. Here comes our waiter.
SpongeBob: [runs while making a weird face] AUUUUUTOOOOOGRAAAAAPH!
Barnacle Boy: Holy sea cow, it's that Sponge-kid!
Mermaid Man: Quick, lad! [pants falls down] To the invisible boatmobile! [runs outside, while holding his pants] Awaaaaay!
Barnacle Boy: ...Where'd we park it?!?!
Mermaid Man: Uhh...
SpongeBob: Can I have your autograph, can I have your autograph, can I... they're gone. [gasps] Mermaid Man's belt!
Mermaid Man: Wait! We'll find it with the invisible boat alarm! [he pulls it out, and makes as to press a button. A car flickers in and out of visibility thrice, making beeps as well] There she is! [they run over and jump in the car. Barnacle Boy hits the seat divider]
Barnacle Boy: Owwww! [rubs his behind] ...I told you we should have got the automatic.
SpongeBob: HEY, GUYS. WAIT UP. [pulling out Mermaid Man's belt; slow motion] I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOOOOOU...
Barnacle Boy: Floor it! [both speed off in the boat]
SpongeBob: You forgot your belt! You forgot— [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive away] Mermaid Man's secret utility belt. The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations!... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it. [makes one step in the boat's direction... then sprints back to the kitchen with the belt on] Or not. [giggles] I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does. [presses the belt, and a pickle barrel shrinks] Whooooa. [grabs the shrunken barrel] The small ray! Eeeee!!! [he giggles and smiles mischievously]
Squidward: Here's your shake, sir. [he starts to hand him the shake, but he is startled by a loud noise from the kitchen and SpongeBob's giggle, causing him to accidentally drop the shake on the guy's head. The guy punches Squidward in the face and storms out. There are more flashes, noises and giggles from the kitchen. Squidward gets up and he holds his head] Grr.
SpongeBob: [Hands a tiny Krabby Patty to a cockroach] There you go. Come again, sir. [Squidward barges in] 
Squidward: SpongeBob. What's going on in here? Huh? [SpongeBob wears a tiny hat and holds a tiny spatula, and a cockroach is eating a Krabby Patty while sitting on a shrunken dining table] Why's everything all tiny?
SpongeBob: [turns the belt around to hide it from Squidward] I don't know.
Squidward: What do you got there?
SpongeBob: Nothing.
Squidward: No, really?
SpongeBob: Nothing.
Squidward: You've got something, alright. Let's see it. [Squidward grabs SpongeBob and sees Mermaid Man's belt]
SpongeBob: No, no!
Squidward: [gasps] Is that Mermaid Man's belt?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Squidward: Wow. I can't believe he'd lend it to you.
SpongeBob: Me, uh... either. [chuckles nervously]
Squidward: [gasps] He didn't lend it to you, did he?
SpongeBob: Please don't tell!
Squidward: [angry] You stole it!
SpongeBob: Please don't tell!
Squidward: Oh, I'm telling.
SpongeBob: Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!
Squidward: Uh-oh! [points at the phone hanging on the kitchen wall] There's the phone.
SpongeBob: Don't!
Squidward: I'm walking towards the phone! [slowly walks towards phone]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: [slowly reaches for the phone] I'm getting closer to the phone.
SpongeBob: [sobbing] Do-o-o-n't!
Squidward: [picks up the phone, ready to call Mermaid Man] And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for.
SpongeBob: [wails and tears himself] I'm begging you!!
Squidward: Hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid... [SpongeBob shrinks Squidward.  He lands on the table] What the? What? [phones hits Squidward on the head] Ow!
Mermaid Man:  [on phone] Hello? Hello?
Squidward: What did you do to me?!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!
Squidward: SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size RIGHT NOW, you are gonna be in really big trouble!
SpongeBob: Uh... uh, okay, uh...
Squidward: I said now!
SpongeBob: Uh... [belt is shown to have several complicated buttons] Uh...
Squidward: Do you hear me?! [SpongeBob zaps Squidward and he appears with multiple eyes with hissing snakes] HOLY FISH PASTE! Get it off me! Get it off me! [takes eyes off him and pants in fear] Don't you know how to work that thing?!
SpongeBob: Uhh, I can do it! [SpongeBob changes Squidward into a burning mess, then changes him to have an enormous nose, then to have no skin, then cut in half by scissors, then changed into more things off-screen while SpongeBob looks in fright. Squidward screams whenever SpongeBob changes him]
Squidward: [looks burnt after SpongeBob’s failed attempts to revert him] Ahh! AHH!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!! Stop! I've got an idea. Let's call Mermaid Man and--
SpongeBob: [snatching Squidward] No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience. [he runs to Patrick's house, where Patrick is sleeping] Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!
Patrick: [wakes up due to surprise] Ehh? Huh? Oh. Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look. [shows Patrick the shrunken Squidward]
Patrick: A Squidward action figure! [grabs Squidward] Let me play with him!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick!
Patrick: Fighter pilot! [imitates jet plane diving, machine gunfire and explosion noises] Dive bomb!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: [about to punch Squidward] And then comes a giant fist!
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident.
Patrick: Oh... [about to punch Squidward anyway] And then comes a giant -- [Squidward screams] 
SpongeBob: [stops Patrick] Wait, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.
Patrick: Oh, don't worry about it. He'll find love one day.
SpongeBob: You think so?
Patrick: Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size. [pulls out a pickle] Like this pickle! See? They like each other!
Squidward: N-n-n-n-no. [Patrick bangs them together as if to kiss. Squidward is disgusted]
SpongeBob: Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!
Patrick: Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You got it set to [points to the M] 'M' for Mini when it should be set to [turns M around] 'W' for Wumbo.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word.
Patrick: Come on! You know... I wumbo, You wumbo, He, she, me... wumbo! Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama... Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!
Squidward: [while Patrick is saying "we'll have the wumbo"] I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.
Patrick: Well, all right, then. Let her rip! [SpongeBob uses Mermaid Man's belt and presses something to try and "regrow" Squidward. Only Patrick and Squidward are both shrunk now] It worked!
SpongeBob: Oh no!
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob's giant! [SpongeBob grabs them] Can I be giant next?
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!
Patrick: You're kidding! [pulls out his pickle] Good thing I still got this pickle! [kisses the pickle three times. Pan over to Squidward]
Squidward: Hey! Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!
SpongeBob: [yells in Squidward's face] No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise. [gets a jar and puts them in] Until then, you'll be safe in this jar.
Patrick: You know what's funny? My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again! Heh. It's like a pun or something! Heheh...
SpongeBob: It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it. [Sandy suddenly appears]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams] Sandy! [shrinks Sandy]
Sandy: [lands on the ground] What did you... For cryin' out... What did y'all do to me?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and... [Larry appears]
Larry: Hey, SpongeBob! [shrinks Larry]
Nat: Hey, SpongeBob, I -- [shrinks Nat]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Hi, SpongeBob. [shrinks Nancy; SpongeBob screams and makes a run for it]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, SpongeBob. [shrinks Mrs. Puff]
Scooter: Sponge-dude! [shrinks Scooter, Sandals, and Dennis]
Fish #1: Hey, SpongeBob! [shrinks fish]
Fish #2: SpongeBob, hi! [shrinks fish]
Fish #3: Hey, SpongeBob! [shrinks fish]
Fish #4: What's up, Sponge? [shrinks fish]
SpongeBob: [tries to fit everyone in the jar] Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you just face facts? You've shrunken everybody in Bikini Bottom! You've got to go to Mermaid Man!
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.
Sandy: Well, you can't leave us small forever!
SpongeBob: You don't understand! [SpongeBob's mother is seen in the jar]
Mrs. SquarePants: [gently and soothingly] SpongeBob. You need to admit your mistakes.
SpongeBob: Mom?
Mermaid Man: Your mother's right, son. Mermaid Man will understand.
Barnacle Boy: You're Mermaid Man, you old coot!
Mermaid Man: Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and...
Mermaid Man: [comforting SpongeBob] Oh, don't worry, son. I understand. [SpongeBob smiles, with tears still pooling in his eyes] Why, I remember back when I first used the belt, the year was nineteen ought eleventy-twelve, why I believe the president—
Everyone: Just tell him how to unshrink us!!!!!
Mermaid Man: Oh, yes. The unshrink ray... let's see, uh — uh... did you set it to Wumbo?
Everyone: WHAT?!?! [the jar rumbles from anger and everyone flies out of the jar, spells out and form the statement...] GET SPONGEBOB!! [climbs up SpongeBob's body and into the holes in his head]
Squidward: Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom... in my own home! [kicks SpongeBob's stomach]
Sandy: And I need an elevator to climb one stair! HI-YA! [punches his brain]
Mermaid Man: We've been shrinking for years!
Barnacle Boy: But this is ridiculous! [both kick his eyeballs. Dale kicks his pelvis, Nancy chops off one of his lungs while hanging on to his spine, Larry kicks his knee. SpongeBob is shown getting hurt from the outside]
Everyone: Everything's too big!!!!!
SpongeBob: I've got it! [Squidward saws a blood vein and Frank tries to break a bone, but stop when SpongeBob shrinks the city] Ta-da! [everyone looks outside through his holes] Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small! [everybody leaves SpongeBob's body] And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese! [turns the shrink ray into W and towards him like a camera and shrinks himself]
Squidward: I guess this is okay.
Larry: Yeah, what's the difference?
Nancy: Good idea, SpongeBob. [everyone cheers, balloons and other party items are flying, as a bus comes back and Plankton gets off of it]
Plankton: Well, it's great to be back! [notices small Bikini Bottom] Huh?


[Mrs. Puff is panicking while SpongeBob is in his driving test again and destroying stuff, as usual.]
SpongeBob: I'm driving, Mrs. Puff! This is the one! This is the one! Come, on SpongeBob! Think! Think! Uhh... [destroys the lighthouse] Turn that way! Turn that way! D'oh! Turn that way! Right! Left! Oh no! No! [destroys the school building] Come on, don't ever do that! Come on! [a nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears] No! I'm ready! I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do it! I can do it! [flies through the entrance while driving, constantly destroying it, leading the fences falling down]
Mrs. Puff: The driving test is over, SpongeBob. Stop the boat!
SpongeBob: Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff, I can do this!
Mrs. Puff: The road, SpongeBob, get back on the road!
SpongeBob: Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass! [Mrs. Puff is screaming as the boat goes through a cart of watermelons]
Vendor: Hey! What've you got against the melons?!
Mrs. Puff: Look out!
SpongeBob: [has a watermelon on his face] This must be the night driving part of the test. [scene cuts to two police officers using their nightsticks on something offscreen]
Officer Nancy: We're gonna straighten you out!
Officer Malley: This'll fix ya! [They grunt as they hit a parking meter until it's straight] Now let's get that one. [points his nightstick at another crooked parking meter. SpongeBob &amp; Mrs. Puff drive by through a building, knocking it over]
Officer Nancy: Barnacles, did you see that?!
Officer Malley: Yeah! That guy had no front license plate! Let's get him! [SpongeBob looks back at the numerous police cars chasing behind him]
SpongeBob: Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town.
Mrs. Puff: Look out! [The mayor is cutting a ribbon at the end of a bridge that is not finished]
Mayor: It is with great pride that I officially open this unfinished bridge! [SpongeBob drives through the ribbon before he cuts it. The crowd of people that are gathering around the mayor take pictures. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff do not make it on the other side of the bridge so they fall to the bottom.]
Mrs. Puff: Where did I go wrong?! [flashback to Mrs. Puff's first day of boating school] With the opening of my new boating school, I pledge that as long as a student is willing to learn, I shall never give up. [SpongeBob walks up to her]
SpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants. [scene cuts back to Mrs. Puff, who is still screaming. Scene then shows a retirement home where a fish in a white coat is yelling at a truck]
Fish: Hurry up with that truckload of fruit punch! The seniors are getting cranky! [fish looks up and notices SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff crashing into the truck]
Mrs. Puff: Alive! I'm alive! Oh, thank Neptune, I'm still... [a squad car smashes down on the boat mobile. The other squad cars fall on and around the truck. The truck falls over on its side as all the fruit punch comes pouring out]
Feminine Tom: [inside the retirement home] Alright, seniors, let's open these windows so the world can see your nice white clothes. [when the window is opened, the fruit punch pours in. Scene cuts to Fred, who is mopping the hallway and listening to "Surfin' Summer" by the Beach Boys on his headphones. The fruit punch fills the hallway, drains, and Fred is still mopping the same spot. Scene cut to an elderly fish man, who is writing on some paper]
Elderly Fish: Oh, it's finally finished! A memoir of my life, written in red ink. [red punch comes flowing in, making his memoir papers soggy and red] Aww, barnacles! [scene cuts back to outside where all the mess is]
Mrs. Puff: Ow. SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob: That depends, did I pass?
Officer Nancy: Freeze, you're under arrest!
Mrs. Puff: Hold it, you can't arrest him! He's just a student driver!
Officer Nancy: We're not talking about him. [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff wearing a prison uniform, being locked up in jail]
Mrs. Puff: But I don't belong here! It's all a big mistake!
Prisoner 1: Yeah, I don't belong here, either!
Prisoner 2: Me too! I'm innocent!
Prisoner 3: [yelling in a butch Southern drawl] I belong here! [this triggers some other prisoners to complain about their not belonging here too. Puff walks over and sits down on the bed]
Mrs. Puff: Okay, you can do this, Puff. You can get through this without losing your sanity. Oh, that's a road we don't want to go down again. Positives. Think of the positives. Let's see... I've got no more papers to grade. Yeah! [laughs then jumps to the floor] In fact, no more work. No more boating school classes. No more driving, no more SpongeBob... [Mrs. Puff's brain clicks and a sonar ping is heard] No more phone solicitors, no more SpongeBob! No more company potlucks, no more SpongeBob! [gets into bed] No more road rage, no more SpongeBob! No more insurance payments, no more SpongeBob! No more SpongeBob! [laughing] No more SpongeBob! [screaming maniacally] No more SpongeBob! [sighs] I think I'm going to like this place. [scene cuts to her boating school, which is deserted and dusty, with SpongeBob the only one in the room]
SpongeBob: Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff with a happy expression]
Mrs. Puff: [hums while breaking rocks. Scene cuts to her making license plates] ♪Smelling the pretty roses, whoo hoo hoo.♪ [scene cuts to her lifting weights] ♪Haaapiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam!♪ [cuts back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt. [scene cuts to the outside of Patrick's rock]
Patrick: Well, it sounds like it's all your fault.
SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head! [Patrick takes one of his dots and puts it in the place of where his nose would be if he had one] Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail.
Patrick: How are we gonna do that? [scene cuts to the First Nautical Bank]
SpongeBob: Alright, put the money in the bag! [SpongeBob is in the bank, wearing a sock over his head, with a bag in his hands, facing the wrong way. He yells] Put it in!
Bank Teller: Umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir.
SpongeBob: [turns around then laughs. Yells again] Alright, give me the money!
Bank Teller: Will that be from your savings or your checking account, sir?
SpongeBob: Uhh, savings.
Bank Teller: May I please see some identification?
SpongeBob: Sure. [takes out a card and gives it to the bank teller] Here ya go.
Bank Teller: Thank you. [SpongeBob's Jellyfishers Club Membership card is shown. As the bank teller types on the cash register, SpongeBob lifts up the sock on his head and gives Patrick a thumbs up] Sir, we are showing a balance of zero dollars and zero cents for both of your accounts.
SpongeBob: Oh.
Bank Teller: Next! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of the bank]
SpongeBob: Well, that went better than expected.
Patrick: Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast! [SpongeBob's eyes rip through the sock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick disguised as yellow and pink rocks]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. [a truck full of rocks drives up]
Fish: Hey, there's a couple. [gets out and throws the two rocks in the truck]
Guard: Put your back in it, girls! [women prisoners are crushing rocks outside. The truck arrives and unloads more rocks]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, there she is! [both jump over to Mrs. Puff where she is about to hit them] Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick!
Mrs. Puff: That's funny. For a second, I thought that yellow rock talked to me. And its voice sounded a lot like...
SpongeBob: SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff screams as she throws the pickaxe behind her] We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff! [Mrs. Puff starts shaking]
Mrs. Puff: It's you. What are you doing here? Why did you follow me in here? Why?! [one of the guards walks up, with Mrs. Puff's pickaxe in his head]
Guard #1: Alright, Mrs. Puff, it seems like this heat's gone to your head. If you're gonna talk to rocks, I guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty.
Mrs. Puff: Yes, it must be the heat. Yes. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here. [a woman prisoner walks over] No, wait! [she smashes the two rocks into pieces] There goes our deposit on these costumes. [scene cuts to lunchtime where Mrs. Puff is serving chili to the prisoners.]
Mrs. Puff: There you are. [A woman with a deep voice walks up to Mrs. Puff]
Woman: Hey there, Puff Mama. What's today's grub?
Mrs. Puff: Hi, Donna. It's chili, same as always. Let me get you some. [scoops up SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob!
Mrs. Puff: When are these horrific hallucinations going to end? [SpongeBob gets out of the chili]
SpongeBob: No, it's really me! [pulls Patrick up out of the chili] I brought Patrick along too.
Patrick: Hi.
Mrs. Puff: Why?
SpongeBob: 'Cause we're gonna set you free!
Mrs. Puff: No, I mean, why'd you bring him? [Patrick eats some chili]
SpongeBob: He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees. [makes a rectangle-shaped entrance in the chili]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I am not going with you.
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on!
Patrick: SpongeBob, I think she means it.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's crazy, Patrick.
Mrs. Puff: He's right, SpongeBob. I'm staying.
SpongeBob: But why?
Mrs. Puff: I like it here. These are my people! [cut to a shot of some angry, gruff looking woman prisoners] And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou... [we see SpongeBob sad. He is sniffling as a single teardrop falls from his eye] ...uranium! In the water supply. [she whips out a glass of water] See? Crystal clear! [she guzzles the water and tosses away the glass] Aahhhh!
SpongeBob: Excuse us for just one second, Mrs. Puff. [to Patrick] Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison. [scene cuts to Frankie Billy in traffic then at his desk at work and then staring out his bedroom window]
Frankie's wife: Coming to bed, honey?
Frankie Billy: Yes, dear. [scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom.
Mrs. Puff: For the last time, no! [SpongeBob and Patrick disappear inside the chili as a guard walks up] I'm not going with you! That's final! [notices the guard] Oh. [laughs nervously]
Guard #1: Talking to inanimate objects again, huh, Puff? Hmph. Get back to your cell. No more kitchen time for you. [Mrs. Puff walks off sad. SpongeBob and Patrick watch her. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff burning coal into wire hangers until SpongeBob and Patrick come down the conveyor belt]
SpongeBob: Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on!
Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come quick. [The guards run over to her] There's a crazed ex-student of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out!
Guard #1: That's just raw material used to make coat hangers. You need some rest. [Grunts as he pushes the level down, squishing SpongeBob and Patrick, which fills the room with steam. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff brushing her teeth. SpongeBob and Patrick come up from the toilet]
SpongeBob: Psst! [Mrs. Puff screams] Hop in, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come look! [guard runs over and sees SpongeBob and Patrick in the toilet]
Guard #1: Whoa. They don't pay me enough to do this job. [The guard flushes the toilet. Cuts to Mrs. Puff in her bed. SpongeBob and Patrick peek from the top bunk]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, up here.
Mrs. Puff: Guards, guards! They're back! [two guards walk up]
Guard #1: What's all the hubbub, Puff?
Mrs. Puff: They're back! [guards remove their heads showing them as SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Mrs. Puff, it's us! [both wink and give her a thumbs up]
Mrs. Puff: [screams and cries as the real two guards run up]
Guard #1: What the barnacle is going on?
Mrs. Puff: Get away from me! Get away!
Guard #1: What are you talking about, Puff?
Mrs. Puff: You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili. [rips off the guards' faces leaving their skulls shown]
Guard #1: Let's face it, Puff, you've gone off the deep end. [scene cuts to the guards throwing Mrs. Puff, who is in a straitjacket, in a small square room] Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement! [slams the door, which makes a squeaking sound]
Mrs. Puff: Oh well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room.
SpongeBob: Made of sponge! [laughs. The room is made of yellow sponge as SpongeBob's face appears on all sides of the wall. Mrs. Puff screams as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air with the police behind them.] I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test! [The boat crashes into the truck full of punch, knocking it over, and spilling again]
Officer Malley: Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk. [police officers walk over]
Mrs. Puff: No! What? [policemen grab SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: No! What are you doing? Help! Help! [As the officers carry him to the jail vehicle, he kicks his legs.] No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! [They throw him into the back of the police car, then drive off]
Mrs. Puff: I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail!
Officer Malley: Why would you go to jail? You already did your time. [zoom out to reveal Mrs. Puff wearing prison striped clothes with a ball chained to her ankle. She screams as the scene goes back to her screaming while the boat is in mid-air]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, it's just my imagination again. [zooms over to show Donna driving the boat]
Donna: So what's for dinner tonight, Puff Mama? Chili? [Mrs. Puff screams again as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air]
Mrs. Puff: Huh? What? Huh? Ah, forget it.


[The episode begins with live-action footage of icebergs appearing.]
Narrator: Ah, observe the majesty of the mighty iceberg. [scene fades to a block of ice falling into the water] This frozen giant, normally found floating in polar regions, can sometimes [Bikini Bottom Atoll is shown.] stray into warmer waters, causing dramatic changes in climate [An iceberg floats next to the island. The scene changes to show a wide shot of Bikini Bottom. Snow is shown falling.] for tropical, undersea life.
[It starts to snow harder. Eventually, Bikini Bottom is blanketed in show. Johnny Elaine appears wearing a snow hat.]
Johnny Elaine: Yes, it seems Old Man Winter paid us a visit late last night, and he brought with him not a pillow or a sheet, [A street in downtown Bikini Bottom is shown.] but a blanket... a blanket of snow! [Jellyfish Fields and its sign are shown covered in snow.] Yes, from Jellyfish Fields... [A jellyfish floats by. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' house.] to residential abodes... [The scene changes to show a traffic light changing from "go" to "stop" then back to "go."] to bustling downtown... [SpongeBob's pineapple is shown.] it's nothing but the white stuff.
[The scene shows a close up shot of SpongeBob's door. SpongeBob opens it and he and Gary are shown.]
SpongeBob: Whoopee!
Johnny Elaine: And local residents are taking notice! [SpongeBob and Gary put on their Santa hats.]
[The scene pans through Jimmy Gus making a snow fish, a snow whale, two kids making a snow mermaid, and Mr. Krabs making a snow dollar. The scene changes to show Mrs. Puff walking to her boat. She puffs up and blows the snow off. She gets in and drives past the show that was previously on her boat. Fred pops out and shakes his "fist".]
Fred: Hey!
[A wide shot of the Chum Bucket is shown. A close shot of the doors is shown. Plankton opens the door.]
Plankton: [walks outside the Chum Bucket] What's this? Drops of rain frozen into ice crystals? I shall harness their energy and rule the world! [He laughs evilly, but a bunch of snow falls on top of him.] Ahh... oh, stop! I wish to rule you! [he is now buried in snow.] 
[The scene changes to show Patrick. He has an idea.]
Patrick: Snow angel! [laughs while on the ground flapping his arms and legs. He stands up. He looks behind him to see a circle.] Oh... [a snowball hits him in the side of the head] Hey! [SpongeBob whistles] Thanks a lot, SpongeBob! While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!
SpongeBob: Oh, really, Patrick? [giggles] Did the snowball look like this? [Throws another snowball. This one hitting Patrick's eyes]
Patrick: Yeah. [SpongeBob laughs. Patrick runs over to SpongeBob] This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it?
Patrick: Snowball fight? I want to play! I want to play!
SpongeBob: Well, first, you have to make a snowball.
Patrick: Oh, yeah. A snowball. [bends down and starts making a snowball] Oh, this is gonna be great! [shows his snowball but it's a cube] Huh? [tries making another snowball but it's a rectangular pyramid] Wha...? [tries making another snowball but it's DNA] Aw...! SpongeBob, could you help me make a snowball?
SpongeBob: Sure, pal. [makes a snowball and hands it to Patrick]
Patrick: Thanks, buddy. [throws it at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick! How could you?
Patrick: It's a snowball fight, remember?
SpongeBob: Oh yeah. [they stare at each other then run back to their forts they made out of snow. They start to throw lots of snowballs at each other. Scene pans up then cuts to inside of Squidward's house where Squidward is sitting by the fire with slippers on each tentacle]
Squidward: Ah, yes. Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge. [he picks up the lemon wedge, then squirts lemon juice in his eye, which is now twitching] Why do I even bother? [Banging is heard outside. He looks outside to see SpongeBob and Patrick building snow forts as we hear construction noises] Would you two please keep it down?!
SpongeBob: Squidward! You're just in time to enlist in my army! Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!
Patrick: That's me!
SpongeBob: I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!
Squidward: Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity. You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me. [snickers] Got 'em Both. [notices a snowball flying at him, so he ducks. The snowball puts out his fire] Grrrrrrrr! [Squidward closes his window]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you fool! This was over before it started! I will now consider your unconditional surren-... [a snowball hits him in the face, sending him into the snow. He then drowns in it] ...-der. [Patrick laughs hysterically] So that's how he wants it to go down. [takes off his Santa hat, revealing a funnel under it. Scoops up snow in the funnel and puts it on his head. He jumps up on his fort, takes a deep breath, and starts shooting snowballs at Patrick very fast]
Patrick: Huh? [as snowballs pile on him. He then stands up, revealing a bunch of snowballs lined up on his forehead] Ha! You missed me! [SpongeBob shoots more snow into Patrick's mouth. Slow motion occurs then resumes to normal speed. Patrick swallows the snowballs and blows out cold breath. A gun cocks and SpongeBob fires more snowballs and this time the snowballs get stuck in his mouth]
SpongeBob: Score one for the boys back home! [Patrick walks up to Squidward's house and knocks on his door]
Squidward: Yes? Oh, Patrick. [Patrick is still choking] What an unpleasant surprise. Oh, boy, nothing like a game of charades. [Patrick swallows the snowballs]
Patrick: [in one breath] I was trying to tell you that I was choking on snow, but the snow melted and turned into water, and I drank all the water, now I'm better.
Squidward: Fascinating. [he slams the door] Now, where was I? [Patrick knocks on the door again] What?
Patrick: [dancing around] Can I use your bathroom?
Squidward: Patrick, go use your own bathroom.
Patrick: I don't think I can make it! Please?
Squidward: No.
Patrick: Please?
Squidward: No.
Patrick: Please?
Squidward: No.
Patrick: Please!
Squidward: Okay, make it quick.
Patrick:  [Pause] That's okay. [Squidward widens his eyes]
SpongeBob: Aha! Aiding the enemy! I've caught you red-handed, Squidward!
Squidward: Look, SpongeBob, I was just... [SpongeBob throws a snowball at Squidward but he ducks and it lands in his fire again, putting it out] SpongeBob! Oh... [picks up a snowball. SpongeBob shrieks]
Patrick: Yay! Squidward's on my side!
Squidward: I most certainly am not!
SpongeBob: Then that means he's on my side!
Squidward: No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either. I'm on nobody's side. Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level. [drops the snowball] If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it. [walks back inside and slams the door]
Patrick: Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Squidward: Hmm... [imagines Patrick throwing a snowball at SpongeBob, knocking his brain out]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's out.
Squidward: [snickers] Now there's something I'd actually like to see! [takes a chair up to one of his windows] Nothing wrong with getting a front-row seat, I suppose. [snickers] Ahh. What's this? [SpongeBob and Patrick are shaking hands] Wha... I... no! [walks back outside] What are you doing? You're supposed to be [punches the right side of his head] knocking each other's brains out!
SpongeBob: We signed a peace treaty, Squidward. [Patrick shows treaty] You were right, fighting is for children.
Squidward: No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty! [rips the treaty into pieces] There! Let the war continue!
SpongeBob: Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty.
Squidward: Look, you two are giving up too easily. Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob.
Patrick: And who am I?
Squidward: You're Patrick.
SpongeBob: Can I be Mr. Krabs?
Squidward: No! Wait, why?
SpongeBob: He's a good leader.
Squidward: Would you butt out?!
Patrick: Hey, you can't talk to Mr. Krabs like that, Squidward!
Squidward: I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick! [Squidward throws a snowball at Patrick's eyes] Now, what are you going to do? [Patrick throws it back at Squidward hitting his eyes] Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?
Patrick: You said you were SpongeBob, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [imitating Mr. Krabs] Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! [laughs in his regular voice]
Squidward: [silently] Oh, boy. All right, I can see where this is going. Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war. Now...
SpongeBob: If you're in this war, then where's your fort?
Squidward: I don't have one, okay? Now...
Patrick: You got to have a fort, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Forts win wars, Squidward.
Squidward: [growls] Okay, fine! You want a fort? [makes a small snow fort] There. There's your fort! Now...
Patrick: Your fort's too small, Squidward.
Squidward: It's okay, Patrick. It's just a demonstration. Now...
SpongeBob: He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny.
Squidward: Trust me, it's fine. [Patrick throws a snowball at Squidward. He wipes the snow off his face]
SpongeBob: See, it is too small.
Squidward: Not if I crouch down. I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down. [crouches down] See? Down here, I am perfectly... [Patrick throws a snowball at Squidward]
SpongeBob: Exposed.
Squidward: Would you two please... [Patrick throws a snowball at Squidward] ...stop throwing... [Patrick throws another snowball at Squidward] ...snowballs?! [Patrick pauses and throws another snowball at Squidward. Squidward growls and retaliates with a snowball of his own but it puts out his fireplace yet again]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward returned fire!
Patrick: Then it's war!
Squidward: No-no... no, wait, wait, wait! [crouches down behind his snow fort] I was just giving a demonstration! [SpongeBob and Patrick throw lots of snowballs at Squidward. Squidward ends up looking like a snowman from all the snowballs that hit him. A hat then falls on his head. He then growls and breaks out of the snowman] All right, that's it! You guys asked for it! [throws a snowball at SpongeBob] I got him! Ha! I got him! [laughs] In your face, SpongeBob! [laughs] This was actually kind of... exciting! Why... I've never felt so alive!
Patrick: [laughs] He got you good, SpongeBob! [Squidward throws a snowball at Patrick and then throws lots of snowballs at SpongeBob and Patrick] Take cover! [they crouch down as Squidward continues to throw snowballs]
Squidward: [as he throws snowballs and laughs] Take that... I got you... Yeah... oh, I got you... oh, take that... Whoa, I got you that time... Oh yeah... [he starts to throw snowballs rapidly] Incoming! [SpongeBob peeps up and Patrick approaches him, showing his belly button frozen]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: I think Squidward's taking this really seriously. [Squidward's clarinet is wedged in Patrick's forehead] That last one had his clarinet in it.
SpongeBob: Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B. [they both tiptoe away while Squidward continues to throw snowballs. He eventually stops and pants]
Squidward: What's going on? The snowballs have stopped falling. I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire. [notices his fort is a little lopsided and gasps] What? My left flank is exposed? That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me! [grabs more snow and pats it down] I'll just fix that right now. [laughs] Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. [grabs more snow and pats some more on the north side] Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner! [he pats snow on the back of the fort] There... Ha-ha! [gasps] But what about the possibility of an aerial attack! [starts digging more snow on his fort. Scene cuts to a few seconds later where Squidward has a gigantic fort, near the top of the tree] I guess that ought to do it! [laughs wildly] Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable! [laughs more] Now, where are those fools? [snow falls on Squidward's head] Ha! The first shot has been fired! [throws a snowball while more snow falls on his head] Take this, Patrick! [throws another snowball as more snow falls on Squidward] Taste my frozen fury! [throws two snowballs. Zooms out to show the snow from a tree is falling on Squidward's head] Victory is mine! [laughs wildly] Whee! Ha-ha! Well, I got you now! [Squidward keeps throwing snowballs while SpongeBob and Patrick are watching TV and sipping some cocoa]
SpongeBob: Did you hear something, Patrick?
Patrick: Nope.
Man on TV: Get out the snowshoes and the shovels.


[A sign that says "Fine Antiques For Sale" is put in Mr. Krabs' front yard. Mr. Krabs assembles a rug for the "antiques" to be put in.]
French Narrator: Ah, a yard sale. You know the old saying: "One man's trash is another man's treasure."
Mr. Krabs: [digs in the trash and pulls out a broken razor] Disposable? Phooey. [grabs the trash can and puts all the items in it on his rug for his yard sale]
Narrator: For Mr. Krabs, all trash is treasure. [Mr. Krabs gets another trash can and dumps it on the rug. He sniffs the odor, then uses fresh scent odor spray and sprays it on the pile of trash]
Mr. Krabs: Open for business. [fish walks up] See anything you like?
Fish #1: Yeah, I'll give you a buck-50 for this umbrella. [umbrella has holes in it]
Mr. Krabs: A buck-50 for that? But it's an antique! It belonged to a queen. Ten bucks.
Fish #1: Ten bucks? [opens up the umbrella] It's full of holes!
Mr. Krabs: It was the queen of Switzerland.
Fish #1: A queen you say? That's-- Wait a second! They don't have a queen!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Mr. Bargain Hunter, five bucks.
Fish #1: [hands money to Mr. Krabs] Deal! [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: [smells the money] Ah, the sweet smell of an all-day sucker. [slurping in background]
SpongeBob: They taste even better. [SpongeBob and Patrick are licking lollipops] Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: Whatcha you doing?
Mr. Krabs: I'm having an antique sale. Have a look around.
SpongeBob: [grabs a plunger] Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh?
Patrick: That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the plunger from SpongeBob] That ain't no toilet plunger! This here's an antique! It's, um... uh... [turns the rubber part of the plunger upside-down] ...a 17th-century soup ladle, see?
Patrick: Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?
Mr. Krabs: Five bucks.
Patrick: [gets out his money] I only got seven.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the money] Deal.
Patrick: Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper. [grabs his lollipop, now stuck on a pair of underwear, and licks it]
SpongeBob: Wow! Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever.
Mr. Krabs: That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: This hat says, "Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking." This hat was made for you, boy. [puts it on SpongeBob] You were born to wear this hat.
SpongeBob: Ee-hee, ooh...!
Mr. Krabs: A perfect fit, eh, son?
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together! [sighs. His eyes fill up with joyful tears] How can I ever repay you?
Mr. Krabs: With 10 dollars.
SpongeBob: [reaches into his pocket and takes out some money] All I have is 5.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I guess it's no deal.
SpongeBob: I'll be right back. [zips home to get change out of the couch, in his shoe, and in his piggy bank then runs back to Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say?
Mr. Krabs: Well-- I don't know... uh, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [he and Patrick walk off]
Mr. Krabs: Don't mention it, boys. [chuckles] What a couple of rubes.
Fish #2: Excuse me, sir, but are you the purveyor of this curio stand?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, I am.
Fish #2: I understand you're selling this rare novelty drink hat. [holds up a picture of the hat that SpongeBob just bought]
Mr. Krabs: Fresh out.
Fish #2: Let me explain. [takes out some money] I'm prepared to give you $500 for that drink hat.
Mr. Krabs: [drools] Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-...
Fish #3: Not so fast. [elbows the other fish out of the way] I'll give you $1000 for such a hat. [Mr. Krabs is stammering and drooling]
Nat: I'll give you $100,000, in cash, for said hat. [Mr. Krabs is drooling up a river]
Fred: [in a row boat] Sir? I'll give you a million dollars for that hat! [row boat drifts off]
Mr. Krabs: [runs off to find the hat, leaving a trail of drool behind] SpongeBob! [Cut to SpongeBob blowing bubbles with his new hat, in front of his house. Mr. Krabs is hiding behind a rock] There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth.
SpongeBob: Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, never mind that. Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl.
SpongeBob: Am I a pretty girl?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful. [mail fish looks at Mr. Krabs with his eyebrow raising] Uh... heh-heh. [SpongeBob laughs] All right, now give me the hat back.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through. [Thought bubble of earlier. SpongeBob gets the hat and sits down a few feet away from the curio stand] Thanks, Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up.
Mr. Krabs: Aw, forget it! And you're not beautiful, either.
SpongeBob: I'm not? [Cut to later where SpongeBob is still blowing bubbles when Mr. Krabs shows up with a bag of hats]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Just the man I wanted to see. Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Mr. Krabs: Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh.
Mr. Krabs: Not even a teensy-tiny bit?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag.
SpongeBob: What is it?
Mr. Krabs: Novelty hats. [takes out a hat with a fan on top of it] How about this air-condition one? [turns it on and blows air really hard in SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Seems a little dangerous. [Mr. Krabs takes out a hat with a mixer on it]
Mr. Krabs: The juicer. [puts in a carrot and the juicer spits out carrot juice]
SpongeBob: Ooh... [Mr. Krabs takes out a hat with the words 'FOXY GRANDPA' on it]
Mr. Krabs: Foxy Grandpa? [SpongeBob laughs] So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?
SpongeBob: No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though.
Mr. Krabs: I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure. I didn't want to have to do this, but he leaves me no other option. [close-up on his mouth] I'm gonna have to scare it off of him. [Cut to nighttime. SpongeBob is snoring. Outside, Mr. Krabs runs up to his window with a fishing pole and a notepad. He draws a ghost on a page]  Heh-heh-heh! This'll scare 'im. [tears the page out of the pad, attaches it to the pole's hook, and throws the line into SpongeBob's window. He gives off a "haunting" moan]
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list! [piece of paper is on the opposite side, with the words "MILK EGGS CHEESE" written on it. SpongeBob screams]
Mr. Krabs: I'm not a shopping list... [turns paper around to show ghost] I'm a ghost!
SpongeBob: [screams]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs evilly] Now, listen, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: How do you know my name?! Who are you?!
Mr. Krabs: I am the ghost of soda drink hats. [hangs down another piece of paper with the soda drinking hat that SpongeBob has] I'm here to tell you that that soda drinking hat you possess is cursed.
SpongeBob: Cursed?
Mr. Krabs: Yes. It once belonged to some guy who's dead now.
SpongeBob: What guy?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... Smitty something.
SpongeBob: Smitty what?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... Smitty Werben... Jaegerman... Jensen.
SpongeBob: He must've been number one.
Mr. Krabs: Number one in Boogeyland! Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately.
SpongeBob: Immediately?
Mr. Krabs: Immediately...
SpongeBob: To its owner?
Mr. Krabs: Yes...
SpongeBob: Right now?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes! It must be returned to its owner, right now.
SpongeBob: [walks up behind Mr. Krabs, covered in dirt and holding a shovel] Hey, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] What?! There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!
SpongeBob: Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery.
Mr. Krabs: How did? I just... You did... I would... Gimme that shovel. [walks off to the cemetery]
SpongeBob: It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1! [Cut to Floater's Cemetery where eerie moaning is heard. A clam on a tree branch hoots like an owl]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Ducks as a bunch of clams are flying over him. Then a black snail growls at him] Ahh! [The black snail slithers away] Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones. [gate squeaks open] Ah! [hides behind a tombstone on a hill] What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here? [Sees Squidward crying as he walks up to a tombstone, puts flowers on it, then leaves. Mr. Krabs walks up to the tombstone Squidward was looking at and reads it] "Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams." What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster. [looks at the names on the different tombstones] Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh. No. No. Uh-uh. No. Not there. [Cut to later] I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue. [thought bubble of SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets. [thought bubble of SpongeBob disappears]
Mr. Krabs: No, not that! [second thought bubble of SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess! [second thought bubble of SpongeBob disappears]
Mr. Krabs: [repeatedly] No, no, no, no, no! [third thought bubble of SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on-
Mr. Krabs: [punches thought bubble away] Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find-- [he sees the tombstone and it shows his real name, Smitty Werben Man Jensen] The grave! Am I really going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am! [digs and hits something] Jackpot! [opens up the coffin] Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa. [takes head off with the hat on] Hey, come on, Smitty, let go! [takes his head off] Rest in pieces, Smitty. [jumps out of the hole] I got the million dollar hat. [lightning and thunder booms. Smitty stands up from his grave with his head in one hand]
Smitty: Hey, man, that's my hat. Give it back.
Mr. Krabs: What? No way. Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy. Go ahead, play dead.
Smitty: I guess I'm gonna have to take it from you.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, right. You and what army?
Smitty: [eerie moaning] Only the army of the living dead. [all the other dead bodies are walking towards Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards.
Smitty: That's disgusting! We just want the hat back.
Mr. Krabs: No flipping way! [takes the head of a swordfish and uses it as a sword] Back off! Back off, I say.
Smitty: Attack. [the zombies ready their weapons]
Mr. Krabs: Tallyho! [sword fights a few zombies] Look at me, I'm Errol Fin! [chops up more bodies] You're falling apart, marrow brain. You must be kidding. [sword fights them] Back to oblivion. [jumps over a group of zombies] Oh, ho. How's your sister? All right, boneheads, playtime's over. Yee-hoo, ha-ha! [twirls around and destroys more of the zombies in the morning Mr. Krabs finishes destroying all the skeleton zombies and runs out of the cemetery] Wa-ha! A million dollars. I've got a million dollars! [runs back to his curio stand where the fish are talking altogether at once] Oh, there you are. Well, I got it. The rare novelty soda drinking hat. Let's start the bidding at one million dollars. [all of the fish laugh]
Fred: Yeah, you want that all at once?
Fish #3: One million dollars. You gotta be kidding!
Nat: Hey! The poor sap's not kidding. Didn't you hear? They found a whole warehouse full of them. They're worthless. [Bunch of soda drinking hats are in the dumpster. The fish crack up laughing. SpongeBob walks by with a hat with clapping hands on the top of it]
SpongeBob: Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand. [laughs]
Nat: Now that's worth a million dollars. [SpongeBob laughs again and he leaves the background. Nat runs after him and the other fish follow] Hey, kid, wait up!
Fish #2: I saw him first!
Fish #3: I'll give you one billion dollars!
[Fred rows his row-boat along the ground to chase SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's a spirit breaker. [throws the soda drinking hat away and breaks down sobbing]
Squidward: [walks by with flowers in hand] What a baby. [walks off]


[Mr. Doodles is sniffing some coral.]
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, Mr. Doodles, [pulls Mr. Doodles away, choking him briefly] we haven't got all day. We've got to get down to me favorite restaurant. Mine. Where we're shooting our first ever Krusty Krab commercial. After this commercial airs, we'll be swarming with customers. I can already feel myself sweatin' money.
[Mr. Doodles barks.]
Mr. Krabs: No, I got Squidward organizing the whole thing. He's... ya know... artsy. [sees something he does not like] What the...? This looks expensive. Out of my way. Coming through. Move it or lose it. Squidward!
Squidward: [descending] What?
Mr. Krabs: What in Neptune's name is going on?
Squidward: We're making the commercial, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What you're doing is throwing away me money! I told you to rent, only, what is absolutely necessary.
Squidward: This is all necessary.
Mr. Krabs: Well what's all this useless junk? [the junk is shown]
Squidward: That's the useless junk for scene, uhh, 28!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, well, then how do you explain that: [pointing to 2 Krusty Krabs] a second Krusty Krab??
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, everyone needs an understudy! [showing Mr. Krabs' double]
Mr. Krabs: Well, ya got me there... but why do we need him? [pointing to a clown]
Squidward: This job gets very stressful, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: All right, get lost, all of ya. [everyone leaves angrily] You're fired. Go on. Scram. Get out of here, you moochers. That's right, keep moving. [stops the clown from leaving] Except you. You stay. [Clown smiles and a horn honks]
Squidward: Well, this is just great. Now we've got no crew to make the commercial.
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about, Squidward? We got the cheapest crew in the world. You, me, and SpongeBob. Speaking of which, where is the little barnacle?
SpongeBob: [sticks his nose from underground] I'm down here, sir.
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, lad?
SpongeBob: Squidward said I could help by burying myself.
Mr. Krabs: Quit fooling and come on out. [pulls SpongeBob out] I need you to be in the commercial.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Me? In the Krusty Krab commercial? Me! [we see a background of him smiling]
Squidward: But, but, but, but, but, but, but...
Mr. Krabs: [SpongeBob is still smiling] Don't throw your buts at me, Mr. Squidward. We got a timetable to keep. This thing airs tonight.
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Tonight?!
Mr. Krabs: Yup, I got a sweet deal on the prime-time slot.
Narrator: 3:28 am
SpongeBob: It's almost on, Gary.
Gary: [yawns]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I got butterflies, too. This is the most exciting thing to happen in the history of history. [TV shows wild west show. Then shows KK commercial]
SpongeBob: Look, Gary! It's on!
[commercial starts]
Pearl: Oh, Jen. I've got a real problem.
Squidward: [Jen] What's your problem, Amy?
Pearl: [Amy] I've got all this money and I don't know what to do with it and I'm hungry.
[Mr. Krabs is laughing off-set]
Pearl: [Amy] Who's there?
Squidward: [Jen] Where's that coming from?
[Purple smoke appears]
Amy and Jen: Yippee, it's Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: That's right, Amy. I heard all about your little problem and I'm here to help. Follow... me!
Amy and Jen: Where are we?
Mr. Krabs: Why, we're at none other than the Krusty Krab.
Amy: Did you say Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: That's right, Krusty Krab. Home of the world famous Krabby Patty!
Jen: What's a Krabby Patty?
[Mr. Krabs' jaw drops]
Mr. Krabs: Why, it's only the most mouthwatering appetizing food in the seven seas.
SpongeBob: THERE I AM, GARY, THERE I AM!
Mr. Krabs: We start with a fresh patty, grilled and juicy. Add some crisp undersea veggies and cheese. Topped off with secret sauce and some buns. Voila! A Krabby Patty.
Amy: I want a Krabby Patty.
Jen: Me, too.
Mr. Krabs: How do you like them Krabby Patties, girls? [laughs]
Amy &amp; Jen: [thumbs up. Mr. Krabs still laughing]
SpongeBob: LOOK, GARY, THERE I AM AGAIN, LOOK!
Mr. Krabs: Two more satisfied customers. So why don't you come on in, and have yourself a Krabby Patty today.
All: ♪The Krusty Krab: Come Spend Your Money Here!♪
[commercial ends]
SpongeBob: That was the best 60 seconds of my life! Well, time for bed. [The next morning, the rooster crows. SpongeBob wakes up and the alarm goes off] Time to go do my favorite thing at my favorite place. [humming]
Old Man Jenkins: Hey, you!
SpongeBob: Top of the morning, oldster.
Old Man Jenkins: Hey! I saw you on TV last night. [Then a flashback shows that Old Man Jenkins was actually watching a bran flakes commercial and saw the yellow box]
Announcer: New, Bran Flakes. Bold, new taste. Bran Flakes.
SpongeBob: You did?
Old Man Jenkins: Yeah. You were on a commercial.
SpongeBob: You're right! Wow, he recognized me.
Old Man Jenkins: Yup. See ya later, Bran Flakes. What a nice cereal box.
SpongeBob: [talking to self] "Weren't you that guy on TV?" Yes! I am that guy. [laughs] How kind of you to notice. Weren't you that guy on the television last night? Yes, that was me. I... [runs into Peterson]
SpongeBob: Oh, please excuse me, sir.
Peterson: Oh, that's quite all right, uhh, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Wow. I'm getting recognized all over. Why, next thing you'll know, people are going to start doing things like holding doors open for... [gasps] Why, sir, I'm flattered.
Peterson: Really? I don't smell anything.
SpongeBob: [laughs] You're on your way.
Fred: Excuse me, sir, can I get a napkin?
SpongeBob: Why, of course, good sir. And next time, feel free to approach me. It most be so degrading to ask across the room. And who am I making this bad boy out to?
Fred: To my tail fin. I'll get it myself.
SpongeBob: F-I-N. There we are, darling. Hmph. Looks like shyness got the best of him.
Squidward: There you are, SpongeBob. I need you to...
SpongeBob: No problem, Squidward. I got one already made out. Enjoy.
Squidward: [holding a napkin reading, "To my tailfin; Love, SpongeBob] To my tailfin? [checks to see if he has one]
SpongeBob: Yes, I am that guy on TV.
Tyler: Hey, look!
SpongeBob: Please, good people, no photos at work.
Tyler: Here's the ketchup.
SpongeBob: Well, maybe just one. [poses] Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it.
Mr. Krabs: There you are, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes, pilot.
Mr. Krabs: I need you to... [gets hit with mop] ...Ow! [finger breaks] Alright, boy. Get in there and scrub the head and stop acting so predictable.
SpongeBob: I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful. [we cut to Dale and Lou in the restroom]
Dale: Hey, were you able to catch Glenn the Pinkfish on Flounderman last night?
Lou: No. How was he?
Dale: Well, I knew that this guy's acting was good, but his singing was phenomenal. I'm telling you, Vendor, if that guy was to cut a solo record, he'd be a hit. [both close bathroom doors]
SpongeBob: [pupils change into stars] Solo record!
[In Mr. Krabs' office]
Mr. Krabs: So, if I fire him and make his successor do twice the work, and... [knock on door] ...eh, come in. [in walks SpongeBob and poses like a model] Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. Those heads better be beautiful.
SpongeBob: They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby.
Mr. Krabs: The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy.
SpongeBob: Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now.
Mr. Krabs: What in blazes are you talking about?
SpongeBob: Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person! We're on the same page here, aren't we?
Mr. Krabs: Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work.
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers twice] I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm outta here. [SpongeBob snaps his fingers outside his office]
Mr. Krabs: Oooooh, I've never felt such a strange combination of pity and indigestion.
Bill: There he is! Hey! We've been waiting for you.
Nazz: Where have you been? [SpongeBob makes an O-shaped mouth wiggling]
Bill: How long are you going to keep us standing here?
Squidward: Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders?
SpongeBob: Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast.
Squidward: I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us. [smiling] On second thought, keep 'em waiting.
SpongeBob: No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment.
Squidward: Enter-what?
[SpongeBob grabs microphone]
SpongeBob: How you doing, folks?
All: HUNGRY!
SpongeBob: That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy! [turns down light's dimness]
Squidward: Hey!
Bill: [to his friend] Eating here was your idea!
SpongeBob: I'd like to call this little number "Striped Sweater." ♪The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind [screeching] 'Cause when you're wearing...♪[light turns back on; all yelling]
Bill: WE'RE STARVING!
SpongeBob: ♪That one... special... sweater...♪ [yelling continues] Squidward, this crowd is insatiable.
Squidward: Then why don't you back in the kitchen, and grab some patties, and give them what they [screams] CAME HERE FOR?!?!?!
SpongeBob: Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy. [crowd booing]
Nancy: Is this some kind of joke?
SpongeBob: They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd. [SpongeBob is now juggling patties]
Bill: Oh, now what's he doing?
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down three miles from a blood bank? A cab!
Bill: We're losing our appetites!
SpongeBob: Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer.
All: WE WANT PATTIES!
SpongeBob: Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa! [SpongeBob slips and patties flip in the air]
All: BOO!
SpongeBob: Noooooooooo! [talking in his head] My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on, wasted. [patties land on the grill]
Bill: Hey! Finally!
Nancy: That's what we've been waiting for.
[dotted lines form from his eyes to point to patty]
SpongeBob: They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks. [SpongeBob puts a whole ton of patties on the grill]
All: Yay!
SpongeBob: You like that?
Bill: It's what we wanted all along.
SpongeBob: [thinking] It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns! [speaking] It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this? [Flips patties inside buns]
All: Yeah!
SpongeBob: I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy.
Customers: We want onions! Cheese! Yeah!
SpongeBob: Ready for the grand finale? [splatting]
All: Whoopee! Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling.
SpongeBob: I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this.


Narrator: [Camera cuts to the exterior of The Krusty Krab] Closing time at the Krusty Krab. 
Mr. Krabs: [Counting the change in the cash register] 51, 52, 53... 
Squidward: [Counting his suction cups] 29, 30, 31... 
SpongeBob: [Mopping in synchronization] One, two, three. One, two, three. 
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, can we please go now? 
Mr. Krabs: Perhaps, one of our more loyal workers can enlighten you on company policy. 
SpongeBob: [Referencing the manual] "The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for." 
Squidward: But that's not fair! 
SpongeBob: [Referencing the manual, again] "Clause 3b: The proprietor reserves the right to be unfair." 
Squidward: Teacher's pet. 
Mr. Krabs: Let's see... [counts money in register] five, ten, 25, blue, apple sauce. Everything looks to be in order. Except... [gasps] Where is it? [takes apart the register in search of something] Where is it? 
Squidward: What? 
Mr. Krabs: My dime! Me special dime, the first dime I ever made! I always keep it in the back of the register for luck! 
Squidward: Well, I've never seen it! [Mr. Krabs glares at Squidward in suspicion] 
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, are you prepared to say that with your hand on a stack of Interpretive Dance Quarterlys!? [pulls out a stack of dance quarterlies] 
Squidward: Of course I'm... [makes a shocked face] What are you saying? 
Mr. Krabs: Me? I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test! [holding a lie detector in his hands] 
Squidward: You're saying something! 
Mr. Krabs: Heavens to Betsy, no. It's just that me lucky dime's gone missin', and you've been working the register all day! 
Squidward: Are you accusing me of something? 
Mr. Krabs: Well, the way I see it, there are three possibilities: One, you stole it. Two, you stole it? Or three — YOU STOLE IT!!! 
Squidward: [enraged] I didn't take your precious dime! 
Mr. Krabs: Show me your tentacles! 
Squidward: What?! 
Mr. Krabs: I wanna see empty suction cups! 
Squidward: [squeezes Mr. Krabs' eyes with his tentacles in anger] Here! Here! Here! See 'em?! [stomps away] 
Mr. Krabs: You... you can't do that to me! I'm your boss! 
Squidward: Not anymore, Mr. Krabs! I QUIT! [throws his hat down. The hat falls in slow motion] 
SpongeBob: [gasps] No. [catches the hat with a pillow] Whew. 
Squidward: I'm outta here! 
SpongeBob: Squidward, you're making a big mistake! 
Squidward: Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab! 
SpongeBob: But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy! And what could be better than serving up smiles? [smiles really big] 
Squidward: Being dead, or anything else. 
SpongeBob: I never knew you felt so strongly about it. 
Squidward: Where have you been? 
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter. [Norma appears with cookies on a silver platter and offers SpongeBob a cookie] 
Norma Rechid: Free sample? 
SpongeBob: Cookies! [Takes one, and eats it] 
Squidward: Can I have one-? [Norma is already gone] 
SpongeBob: Anyways, I just want you to know. If you ever get in trouble, come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me... [grabs Squidward and pulls him toward himself] ...we're like brothers. Only closer. [lifts Squidward's shirt and their hearts are somehow joined together and beating in unison. Creepy music plays before Squidward leaps away from SpongeBob.] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to. [imagines himself in various following jobs] I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman. 
SpongeBob: Or a football playing king in space... with a mustache. 
Squidward: [narrows his eyes] Yeah... uh-huh. Ya know, that reminds me, there's been something I've been wanting to say to you since the day we met... goodbye. Next time you see me, this town will be eating out of the palm of my hands! [skips to a homeless Squidward in a box trying to get spare change in a cup from passersby] Spare change? Spare change, ma'am? 
SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward, is that you? 
Squidward: Uh, I, uh... [closes his box] 
SpongeBob: It's me, SpongeBob. [opens his box up] We used to work together. 
Squidward: SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob: There ya go. So, where you living these days? 
Fish: Squidward Tentacles? 
Squidward: Yes? 
Fish: Sign here, please. [Squidward signs and the fish takes his box] 
Squidward: Uh... nowhere. 
SpongeBob: Great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No, wait, let me guess! Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell... you're a football player? 
Squidward: No. 
SpongeBob: A spaceman? 
Squidward: No! 
SpongeBob: A football playing king in space- 
Squidward: Don't you get it?! [sobs] I'M A LOSE-E-ER! I've lost my job, my home, EVERYTHING! 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Even your paintings!? 
Squidward: Nobody would take them, so I had to eat them! [his stomach is shown to have a rectangular shape from his eaten painting. Squidward starts to cry out a fountain of tears into SpongeBob. SpongeBob soaks it up and becomes bigger, but he squishes himself to let the water out] 
SpongeBob: There, there. You can come live with me. [shown at SpongeBob's house] Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed. [Squidward is laying in SpongeBob's bed] 
Squidward: Okay, but just until I get a job. One day... two days tops. 
SpongeBob: [baby talk] Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to. [kisses Squidward on his nose] Good night, my little angel. [the next morning, SpongeBob rings a bell to wake Squidward] Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you. 
Squidward: And in bed, too? Aw, thanks, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I... 
SpongeBob: Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane. [makes plane noises while attempting to put some food in Squidward's mouth with a spoon] 
Squidward: It's really nice of you to help me in my time of need. [swallows the food] I'll try not to be a burden. 
SpongeBob: It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, winner? 
Squidward: No, no, no. You've already... well... [shows SpongeBob putting lotion on his hand and then massaging Squidward's scalp, feeding him grapes, massaging his tentacle, spraying his scalp with hairspray and wiping it, massaging his back then his nose, giving him a baby bottle, wiping his scalp once more, giving him an acupuncture, and polishing his head and seeing his reflection] 
SpongeBob: Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. [throws the blanket upwards and it lands on him as he lies on the sofa] I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good. [turns the lamp off then yawns] Good night, Gary. 
Squidward: SpongeBob, can I get a glass of water? [bottom floor light turns on and SpongeBob marches up stairs and turns on the light to give Squidward the water] Thank you. 
SpongeBob: Good night. [marches back down stairs and turns off the light] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, could I get some more blankets? [SpongeBob marches upstairs again turning on the lights on the way up there] 
SpongeBob: Here you go. 
Squidward: Thank you. [SpongeBob goes downstairs again, accidentally leaving Squidward's light on] SpongeBob, you forgot to turn out the light! [SpongeBob marches upstairs] 
SpongeBob: Good night. [turns off light and when he walks downstairs he trips and makes lots of noises] 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me. 
Narrator: Three weeks later... 
SpongeBob: [exhausted] He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back. [falls down] 
Narrator: Many months later... 
SpongeBob: [even more exhausted. Gary looks tired as well] I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough. [falls down] 
New Narrator: So much later that the old narrator got tired of waiting and they had to hire a new one. 
[SpongeBob drags himself into the room, by now utterly exhausted. Gary doesn't look sympathetic, though.] 
Gary: Meow, meow, meow. 
SpongeBob: [annoyed] I KNOW HE STILL ISN'T LOOKING FOR WORK! DON'T RUB IT IN!!
Squidward: SpongeBob, where's my lemonade? 
SpongeBob: Coming, Squidward... [He falls flat on his face] 
Squidward: [SpongeBob is running down the hallway] SPONGEBOB?! SPONGEBOB?! [SpongeBob enters his bedroom] And why aren't you in uniform? [SpongeBob exits room and re-enters in a maid outfit] It's about time you got here! 
SpongeBob: [sardonically] Here you go, Your Majesty. 
Squidward: I can't drink that. 
SpongeBob: Why not? 
Squidward: Are you blind? Just look at it. [close-up of the lemonade] 
SpongeBob: [becomes irritated] What about it? 
Squidward: That lemon has three seeds in it. That's an odd number! I can't eat anything odd numbered. 
SpongeBob: Fine, I'll just take it out. [takes out lemon and Squidward gets mad] 
Squidward: No! No! IT'S ALREADY CONTAMINATED BY THE BAD LEMON! It won't work. 
SpongeBob: Hmmm... that's two things in this house that won't work. 
Squidward: Then go fix them. 
SpongeBob: [grips the glass of lemonade so hard that it shatters] Two things that won't work! [clenches his fists in anger] 
Squidward: I've changed my mind. I want soup instead. 
SpongeBob: Okay. Don't move. [walks out the bedroom door, revealing his white briefs. He then closes the door, and comes back in wearing normal clothes with a bowl of steaming soup] Here you go. It's alphabet soup. I made it special. [shows soup with the phrase "GET A JOB" in alphabet letters but then Squidward slaps it out of SpongeBob's hands] 
Squidward: Condensed soup from a can? Disgusting. Now you've ruined my appetite. Go fetch me something to read! 
SpongeBob: Oh, okay. How about this? [pulls out a newspaper with the "job listings" page on the front] 
Squidward: [gasps and swats the newspaper away. SpongeBob becomes more angry] GET THAT AWAY FROM ME. You know I'm allergic to newsprint! 
SpongeBob: Haha, ya know, when you swatted that newspaper out of my hands, it reminded me of something a friend of mine did... at his JOB! [SpongeBob's alarm blows him away] 
Squidward: 4:00. Time for my stories. Hurry up, they won't hold the show while you laze around. [SpongeBob rolls in a TV and hands Squidward the remote. Squidward turns it on to see two puppets: one green puppet and one lime green puppet wearing a shirt and tie] 
Puppet #1: [puppet #2 is whistling] Hey, where ya goin'? 
Puppet #2: To my job! 
Puppet #1: You have a job? 
Puppet #2: Why wouldn't I!? I'm not some lazy, inconsiderate jerk who lays in bed all day! 
Puppet #1: Say, where can I get one of these... jobs? 
Puppet #2: Oh, they're everywhere! [we see SpongeBob playing with the puppets] Especially if you're green and have six tentacles! 
Puppet #1: Thanks. I'm gonna go look for one so I can stop... 
SpongeBob: ...mooching off my friends and they can get back to their lives! 
Squidward: This isn't my show. [presses the remote, but nothing happens] SpongeBob, the remote control is broken! Get over here and fix it! 
SpongeBob: I've got a better idea! [throws the TV away and jumps on top of Squidward in bed] Why don't I call someone whose JOB it is to fix it!? You know why?! Because when I need a JOB [pokes Squidward's nose] done, I get someone with a JOB [pokes Squidward's nose] TO DO [pokes Squidward's nose] THAT JOB!! [pokes Squidward's nose for the fourth time] 
Squidward: [narrows his eyelids] ...What are you saying? 
[This turns out to be the last straw. Outside, it is day. SpongeBob's house jumps into the air before the side is smashed out as an enraged SpongeBob pushes the bed, with Squidward still in it, outside and towards the Krusty Krab while screaming in extreme and total fury.] 
Mr. Krabs: [talking on his phone] Donate to the children's fund? Why?! What have children ever done for me? [SpongeBob grabs the phone and throws it away] 
SpongeBob: You want your dime back?! [takes one out] TAKE IT!!! Now Squidward can come back, right? [Mr. Krabs checks the dime through a telescope] 
Mr. Krabs: Wrong. [throws the dime at SpongeBob's face] That ain't my first dime. 
SpongeBob: Then have some more dimes! [throws out more dimes at Mr. Krabs' face. Mr. Krabs narrows his eyes] I've got plenty of 'em! 
Mr. Krabs: You can't put a price on me first dime. And I can't forgive that thieving bilge rat Squidward for stealing it!
SpongeBob: [finally snapping in extreme rage, he grabs Mr. Krabs by the throat and holds him up in the air] LISTEN, YOU CRUSTACEOUS CHEAPSKATE! SQUIDWARD'S BEEN LIVING AT MY HOUSE, DRIVING ME CRAZY! [shakes him vigorously] AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HIRE HIM BACK ALL BECAUSE OF A STUPID DIME?! [a prehistoric dime falls out of Mr. Krabs' back pocket. SpongeBob suddenly calms down and lets go of Mr. Krabs] What's that?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Me first dime! [hugs the dime] Oh, Dimey, I'll never lose you again! 
SpongeBob: This is a dime? 
Mr. Krabs: I've been in business a long time, boy. 
SpongeBob: So, if Squidward never stole the dime, he can come back to work, right? 
Mr. Krabs: Aye, lad, just let the dime and me have our privacy. [kisses the dime. SpongeBob cheers before running off] 
Mr. Krabs: [at the counter] Well, Mr. Squidward, it's good to have ya back. 
Squidward: Well, it's kind of good to be back, sir. 
Mr. Krabs: It's all water under the bridge now. 
Squidward: I agree, sir. 
Mr. Krabs: After all, I'm sure ya didn't mean to misplace me dime. 
Squidward: What the... what are you saying? 
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's obvious that ya put the dime in me pants. Dimes just don't fly into people's pants. 
Squidward: Are you accusing me of something? [SpongeBob puts the maid costume back on over his clothes] 
Mr. Krabs: Well, the way I see it, there are three possibilities: One, you put the dime in me pants. [outside the Krusty Krab] Two, you put the dime in me pants? OR THREE — YOU PUT THE DIME IN ME PANTS!!!!!


Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon, a luxurious oasis of sand and sea. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy next to a tent]
Sandy: Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimmin' when you're in a shirt and tie?
SpongeBob: Ah, yes. How foolish of me. [cackles] Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit. [goes into the tent, then pokes his head out] And I won't do anything else. [puts his head back in]
Sandy: SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah! [puts on his headgear that was in the bag] Hi-yah! [puts on his karate gloves that was in the bag] Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! [kicks the bag]
Sandy: SpongeBob, are you ready?
SpongeBob: Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready! [softly] Ready to get it on. [jumps out of the tent towards Sandy] Hi...
Sandy: Hi-yah! [kicks SpongeBob in his mouth] Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear.
SpongeBob: [muffled laughter] Great minds think alike, I suppose.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops him into the air. SpongeBob crashes into the ground, followed by his pants, socks, and shoes. He stands up with the clothing on his head and feet in some food]
SpongeBob: I may be down, but I'm not out! [looks down at his feet, which are in some potato salad at a family picnic]
Tom: Way to go, buddy. It took us three days to make that potato salad. [SpongeBob jumps away] Three days!
SpongeBob: [jumps into an empty area] Hi-yah! Sandy?
Sandy: Oh, I'm Sandy, alright. [her arms come out of the ground and squish SpongeBob's face] I'm very Sandy. [kicks SpongeBob into the air] Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it. She's "Sandy." That's her name; she's also covered in... yes! [flies out of the water then back into it. Scene cuts to Sandy talking to an ice cream vendor]
Sandy: Back in Texas, we call ice cream "frozen cow juice". Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob in the face with her karate glove] Thank you.
Ice Cream Vendor: No, no, thank you.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob again, sending him into the air and flying into a strong fish that is waiting in line]
Tough Fish #1: [growls] Who threw that piece of paper at me? [SpongeBob stammers and whistles]
Sandy: Hey, what's everybody waitin' in line for?
Tough Fish #1: Ahoy, fair lass, it be the line to get into the Salty Spitoon — [points over to an old building] the roughest, toughest sailor club ever to be built under the seven seas. Only the baddest of the bad can get in. You need to have muscles. [flexes his arm] You need to have muscles on your muscles. [flexes, even more, created more muscles on his previous ones] You need to have muscles on your eyeballs! [flexes his eyes, creating muscles]
SpongeBob: Ew. [a fish is screaming while flying out of the Salty Spitoon]
Sandy: Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yeah, let's go in.
Reg: [lets a fish walk in] Go ahead. [line moves up] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Tough Fish #1: How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning!
Reg: Yeah, so?
Tough Fish #1: Without any milk.
Reg: Uhh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting. [tough fish walks in. Sandy walks up to Reg] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Sandy: How tough am I? [rips off one of his tattoos that says "MOM" and puts it upside down back where it was. Reg screams in pain when Sandy rips off the tattoo]
SpongeBob: Wow.
Sandy: Got any more tattoos? [Reg covers the upside down tattoo with his arms]
Reg: Uhh, that won't be necessary. Go ahead.
Sandy: Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob! [walks in]
Reg: How tough are ya?
SpongeBob: How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
Reg: Sure. [hands the bottle of ketchup to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: It's on! [strains to open it, but he can't] If I could just run this under some hot water...
Reg: Get outta here. This place is too tough for you, little man.
SpongeBob: Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.
Reg: Listen, kid. I think you'd be more comfortable over at that place. [points to the building across the street]
SpongeBob: Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg: Uhh. Oh, no, sorry, I was actually pointing at the place next to it. [points to another building]
SpongeBob: Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg: Yeah. Unless you think you're tough enough to fight me. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in a seat at Weenie Hut Jr's]
Nerd #1: How's your collection coming along?
Nerd #2: Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty sweet. I'm in the process of acquiring issue 347 which will give me my fourth complete set.
Nerd #1: No...
SpongeBob: [snorts] What weenies. Oh, brother.
Robot: [robotic voice] Would you care for another diet cola with a lemon twist, weenie?
SpongeBob: What? But I'm not a weenie! [the robot scans SpongeBob with one of its scanners]
Robot: I'm sorry, sir, but my sensors indicate that you are indeed a weenie. [computer beeps and shows a picture of a hot dog weenie with the word "YES" below it]
SpongeBob: That's impossible! [the two nerds look at him. He runs off]
Robot: You can't hide what's inside.
SpongeBob: [runs over to Reg] I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie! [a strong, orange fish walks up]
Tough Fish #4: Hey, Reg, how's it going? [SpongeBob screams in surprise and he jumps onto Reg's arms.]
Reg: You were sayin'? [to orange fish] Go ahead, buddy.
Tough Fish #4: Thanks, Reg. [walks in]
SpongeBob: So, your name's Reg?
Reg: [throws SpongeBob aside] Would you get outta here?
SpongeBob: Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will! [runs off. Scene cuts to Weenie Hut Jr's]
Nerd #1: Couldn't get in, huh? What you need is a tough hairdo. No one gets into the Double S without a tough hairdo.
Nerd #2: I disagree, I saw a guy going in there and he was bald.
Nerd #1: I saw that guy. He wasn't bald. He had a shaved head. Shaved — that's a hairdo. Case closed. [both fish notice SpongeBob is gone] Hey, where'd he go?
Robot: I believe he said something about going to the wig store.
Nerd #1: Ha-ha! Check and mate. [Someone who looks like SpongeBob walks over to Reg with a cool, black wig on]
Drifter: What's shakin', my man?
Reg: Not much. Say, haven't I seen you before?
Drifter: Doubt it — I'm a drifter — just blew into town. Heard your club was pretty tough, thought I'd check it out.
Reg: Nice try, kid. I know it's you.
Drifter: What're you talking about? [Reg pulls Drifter's hair, but it is still attached to his head, it's real hair]
Reg: Aha! [the hair does not come off. SpongeBob walks up with a clown wig on]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody, what's goin' on? [the Drifter gets angry as Reg tries to redo his hair, but can't do it]
Reg: Ah, you can go in. Sorry about that. [Drifter angrily walks in] Well, what do you want?
SpongeBob: I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order. [Reg takes the wig off SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob laughs nervously] So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate? [a big, green fish walks up with a tattoo of a seahorse on his right arm]
Tough Fish #5: Hey-ya, Reg.
Reg: Alright, now it's a party! Oh, yeah, check out the new ink.
Tough Fish #5: Thanks. Hey, look what I can make it do. [moves his arm, which makes the seahorse tattoo wiggle]
Reg: [chuckles] Yeah. Hey, what about that one? [big, green fish looks at his left arm that has a SpongeBob tattoo on it]
Tough Fish #5: Huh, you know, I don't remember getting this one.
Reg: Can you make it dance?
Tough Fish #5: Well, here, let me try. [moves his arm. SpongeBob dances]
Reg: Hmmm, wait a minute. [rips SpongeBob off his arm] Go ahead in. [the tattoo fish walks in, rubbing his left arm]
Tough Fish #5: Yeah, sure, Reg. Thanks.
Reg: Nice try, little man. [throws SpongeBob to the back of the line behind two strong fish]
Tough Fish #6: Hey, I was in front of you!
Tough Fish #7: No, you weren't!
Tough Fish #6: You callin' me a liar?
Tough Fish #7: I ain't callin' you for dinner! [two start fighting. SpongeBob tries to run away, but the fight goes downhill, with him in it. Reg walks over]
Reg: Hold it, you two! That's enough, you're both plenty tough, go ahead in.
Tough Fish #6: Alright!
Tough Fish #7: Thanks, Reg. [both run off as SpongeBob comes out from under the sand]
SpongeBob: Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap. [He dusts his clothes using his hands]
Reg: [chortles] I saw you runnin'. When you get in a real fight, then we'll talk.
SpongeBob: Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. [spins his legs, then his hands, and then cracks his fingers, but they are snapped in half. The scene cuts out to SpongeBob’s broken fingers. He starts to cry and runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob with his fingers in a bowl of ice cream, whimpering]
Robot: Care for another sundae, weenie?
SpongeBob: [jumps angrily] I am not a weenie!
Nerd #1: Relax, you're among friends. [raises his drink]
SpongeBob: My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's. [scroll over to Patrick in the seat next to him]
Patrick: You tell 'em, SpongeBob! [sips his drink]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what're you doing here?
Patrick: I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.
Nerd #1: Actually, they moved Double Weenie Wednesday to Friday.
Nerd #2: And besides, today's Monday.
Patrick: Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?
Nerd #1: Uhh, that's now on Sunday.
Patrick: Barnacles!
Nerd #2: Super Weenie Hut Jr's has a Mega Weenie Monday.
Nerd #1: Uhh, no, you're thinking of Monster Weenie Monday.
SpongeBob: I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon! [begins to walks out]
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous.
SpongeBob: I've got no choice.
Robot: I have a suggestion. Why not fake a fight?
Patrick: Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!
Patrick: Yeah! [both run out]
Nerd #1: Hey, how come you never help us out with our problems?
Robot: I am a robot, not a miracle worker. [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Reg]
SpongeBob: Afternoon, Reg.
Reg: Whoa, whoa, little man. You still can't go in.
SpongeBob: Well, that makes me pretty mad.
Reg: Oh yeah?
SpongeBob: Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
Reg: [sarcastically] Wow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.
Reg: Hmmm... what about that guy? [points to a large muscular fish behind him]
SpongeBob: [gasps and stammers] I, uh... [laughs] don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy! [points to Patrick]
Patrick: Who, me? [SpongeBob walks up to Patrick]
SpongeBob: Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!
Patrick: Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh... [looks at his hand, which has writing on it] ...kickboxer. [winks and gives a thumbs-up to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby! [Patrick starts to tear up]
Patrick: Tubby? [Patrick's sadness is quickly replaced by fury and he snarls with rage] Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby! [punches SpongeBob in the eye, leaving a black mark]
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?
Patrick: Oh yeah. [invisible punches flying] No, please wait. [grunting as more invisible punches hit him and an elephant sound is heard when Patrick's head is hit. Patrick is being thrown into the air and on the ground, then given a wedgie] No, please, have mercy! [Patrick is kicked into the background]
Reg: Wow! You destroyed that guy without even touchin' him. [Patrick is still getting beaten in the background]
SpongeBob: I did?
Reg: I never thought I'd say this, but go ahead in.
SpongeBob: Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life! [walks in as Reg smiles. Scene cuts to an ambulance driving down the street with SpongeBob in bandages and Sandy by his side] Sandy? [groans] What happened?
Sandy: You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube. [ambulance arrives at the hospital. Scene cuts to Sandy wheeling SpongeBob in front of the doctor]
Doctor: What happened?
SpongeBob: I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.
Doctor: Boo-boos, eh? Hmmm... I think you guys want that hospital. [points across the street to Weenie Hut General]
SpongeBob: Weenie Hut General?


Squidward: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [looking at his watch while SpongeBob is mopping the floor] I'm done with my shift, Mr. Krabs! And let me just say, there will come a day when I will make something of my life and I will never have to set foot in this grease trap again! [Real-life footage of a cheering crowd appears behind Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, we'll see you after your lunch break, Squidward. [crowd disappears]
Squidward: Okay. [walks out of the Krusty Krab]
Squilliam: [talking to a group of people] So, I just took my private yacht across my private lake to my private heliport. It's the only way off my private island.
Squidward: [gasps] Oh, shrimp! It's my arch rival from high school, Squilliam Fancyson! I can't let him see me in my Krusty Krab uniform. [takes off his hat and is about to put it in the trashcan]
Squilliam: On your lunch break, eh, Squiddy?
Squidward: Yes... I mean no... I mean... uhh, uhh... Hey, whatcha been up to?
Squilliam: Oh, just succeeding in everything you've failed in.
Squidward: You are no great shakes, Squilliam Fancyson. Anyone can be a big shot in a hick town like Bikini Bottom.
Squilliam: Oh, is that so? Let's hear what you've accomplished since high school, Squiddy.
Squidward: [thinking to himself] Don't be intimidated, Squidward. Try to imagine him in his underwear... [imagines Squilliam as a hot underwear model] Oh, no, he's hot! [to Squilliam] I'm, uhh, in... food service.
Squilliam: Hold it, don't tell me. You're a cashier! [laughs. His group laughs with him]
Squidward: [thinking to himself] Don't lie. Lying always makes it worse. [to Squilliam] I own a five-star restaurant!
Squilliam: [as the crowd gasps] Squidward, I had no idea you were such a success.
Squidward: That's right.
Squilliam: And I would be honored if you would allow me to come to your restaurant tonight. [Sound of glass breaking. Squidward's nose shrivels up in extreme shock]
Squidward: T-t-t-t-t-t-tonight?
Squilliam: In fact, we'll all come. My treat! [group cheers. Scene cuts to Squidward in Mr. Krabs' office]
Squidward: Please, Mr. Krabs, you got to help me! When they get here tonight, they're going to see I'm just a big phony and a loser!
Mr. Krabs: Aww, BOO-HOO, let me play a sad song for ya on the world's smallest violin. [rubs his fingers and music plays]
Squidward: This is serious.
Mr. Krabs: I know, this really is the world's smallest violin. [tiny violin is shown] See?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! Please let me run the restaurant for just one night! I really need to impress Squilliam.
Mr. Krabs:  Scrih- Scray- Screh- Squilliam? [Squilliam's unibrow appears above Mr. Krabs' head] That guy who made millions doing what you wish you could do?
Squidward: Don't rub it in.
Mr. Krabs: Why didn't you tell me? We'll take him to the cleaners.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs standing straight in a line. Squidward is walking back and forth in a white tuxedo.]
Squidward: Alright, listen up. Men, Squilliam Fancyson will be here in twenty minutes. Therefore, we need to turn the Krusty Krab into a fancy restaurant as soon as possible. [Patrick appears next to SpongeBob with an army hat on his head] Patrick, what are you doing here?
Patrick: I thought the Corps would help me straighten out my life, sir!
Squidward: The Corps? What the... Pat, this isn't the... oh! [sighs] Beggars can't be choosers. Can you take hats in a dignified and sophisticated manner?
Patrick: You mean like a weenie? Okay! [talks like a weenie] May I take your hat, thir? May I take your haaaat, sir? May I-
Squidward: [shuts Patrick up] Alright, I've heard enough, you've got the job. [walks off] Mr. Krabs, didn't you once serve on the S.S. Gourmet?
Mr. Krabs: Aye-aye!
Squidward: Then you'll be our chef. [Mr. Krabs walks off]
SpongeBob: What can I do?
Squidward: I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob, you're going to have to be the waiter.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Squidward: It's the guy who goes to tables and takes orders.
SpongeBob: Do other restaurants do that?
Squidward: Yes, they do that! Now listen, Squilliam is on his way and you have less than twenty minutes to become a fancy waiter, so read this. [hands SpongeBob a book]
SpongeBob: "How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes." Don't worry, Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks!
Squidward: Alright, I've got all the positions filled. I just might pull this off!
Patrick: GIVE ME MY HAT! [shaking a coat rack with a hat on it] I SAID GIVE IT TO ME! Are you gonna hand it over or not? DON'T YOU BACK-SASS ME! [jumps on the coat rack and starts punching it]
Squidward: He's just the hat-check guy, nothing essential. [an explosion in the kitchen is heard. A bunch of green goop flies out] What happened!? What is it?!?
Mr. Krabs: Peas! [a can of peas, still in the can, is on the stove and is on fire] Made 'em the old-fashioned way.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, you gotta take them out of the... [gasps] HOLY FISH PASTE! WHAT IS THAT!? [notices a giant goop pile of food on the grill, with flies and other things sticking out of it]
Mr. Krabs: That's the appetizer!
Squidward: But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S.S. Gourmet?
Mr. Krabs: Did I say that? No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet. I was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea. [Squidward walks out of the kitchen]
Squidward: There you are! SpongeBob, you gotta help me! [walks over to SpongeBob] Patrick and Mr. Krabs aren't working out, and Squilliam's almost here, and, and... SpongeBob? [turns SpongeBob around. SpongeBob looks like a zombie, tired from reading all the pages]
SpongeBob: I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: Every sentence, every paragraph... [slams the book on his face between each word] Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?! [brain starts to swell] My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode! [he explodes]
Squidward: SpongeBob, hold on! Let's just take a second here to relax. [SpongeBob lowers his arms] Little more. [SpongeBob lowers his arms more] Little more. [SpongeBob's face falls to the floor] Good. Now, I want you to empty your mind.
SpongeBob: Empty my mind?
Squidward: Empty your mind.
SpongeBob: Empty my mind...
Squidward: Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining. Fine dining and breathing. [inside SpongeBob's head, we see a bunch of smaller SpongeBobs working on computers in an office]
Smaller SpongeBob #1: [Runs into the office] Just got an order from the boss: Dump everything that isn't about fine dining!
Other Smaller SpongeBobs: Everything?
SpongeBob #1: Everything! [everyone starts to panic and start throwing everything away] Come on, come on, come on! Bring 'em, bring 'em, bring 'em! Jellies, jellies! [Another smaller SpongeBob shreds papers marked "Jellyfishing" then "Childhood memories" then "Spice Garden Tips] Let's go, let's go! Keep doing it! [walking towards another smaller SpongeBob] Come on, let's get moving! [talking to a smaller SpongeBob] Hurry up! What do you think I'm paying you for?
Smaller SpongeBob #2: You don't pay me. We don't even exist. We're just a clever visual metaphor used to personify the abstract concept of thought.
Smaller SpongeBob #1: One more crack like that and you're out of here!
Smaller SpongeBob #2: No, please! I have three kids! [more dumping persists. Scene cuts back to SpongeBob, with a blank look on his face]
Squidward: How do you feel? [cuts to SpongeBob, still with a blank face] SpongeBob? [snaps his tentacles as SpongeBob drools] This isn't working! [Patrick is walking on all fours with the coat rack in his mouth] I gotta go tell Squilliam I need more time! [runs out the door] I'll just go to Squilliam's house and... [stops because he sees Squilliam and the group] Squilliam, you're here!
Squilliam: Hello, Squiddy! [Squidward steps back] We're all ready to be dazzled by your five-star restaurant.
Squidward: Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!
Squilliam: Explain what? That you, Squidward Tentacles, voted most likely to suck eggs in high school, [walks in] are trying to pass off a lousy burger stand as a five-star... [gulps] ...restaurant!? [inside of the restaurant looks very professional with nice wallpaper, an orchestra, a chandelier, and other things] Hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina... [Squidward joins in chanting "Hommina" and then the group comes in and starts to chant "Hommina" as well. SpongeBob comes in with a tuxedo on]
SpongeBob: Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately! [picks up the group of customers with one hand]
Squidward: [whispering] How did you do all this?
SpongeBob: It was easy, once I cleared my mind.
Squidward: But what about Krabs and Patrick?
SpongeBob: Taken care of. [Mr. Krabs and Patrick are tied up and gagged in the back] Right this way, please. [seats everyone quickly. Then Squilliam is seated without a chair at first, but SpongeBob then rushes back to give his a chair to sit on] Good evening, sir. [gives Squilliam a menu] From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg? [gives Squilliam a shoulder massage as he takes away his menu. As he explains what Squilliam is eating, he gives him a napkin to put on his neck and feeds him the dinner] We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank. [While telling him all of this, he makes Squilliam's experience the best he can so he treats him like royalty doing all sorts of things]
Squilliam: Mmm... this is fantastic!
SpongeBob: [salutes with all the hands that helped] Thank you, sir.
Squidward: Pinch me, I must be dreaming. [SpongeBob pinches him with a pin] Ow!
SpongeBob: If you need anything else, just call.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!
SpongeBob: Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do. [takes a deep breath and runs off]
Squidward: It worked. I can't believe it! Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant. Time to rub it in his face. [SpongeBob is combing Squilliam's unibrow] Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting.
Squilliam: [his eyes tear up] Alright, I admit it. Everything is fabulous. The food, the atmosphere! Everything's flawless!
Squidward: In that case, I need you to read this. [hands Squilliam a card]
Squilliam: Uhh, "Squidward Tentacles..."
Squidward: [puts a foam finger with words "#1 Squid" on his left hand] And I need you to wear this.
Squilliam: Oh, eh, "Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest..."
Squidward: [puts a microphone in front of Squilliam] I'm sorry, one more time. [Squilliam's voice is over the loudspeaker]
Squilliam: "Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest restaurant in Bikini Bottom... and he does not suck eggs." [everyone cheers] Squidward, I must tell you... [SpongeBob pours more water in Squilliam's glass and he drinks it] Thank you. What really won me over was your brilliant waiter. It's as if all he knows is fine dining... and breathing. I must know your name. [record scratches]
SpongeBob: My name?
Squilliam: Yes, your name, son.
SpongeBob: Uhh... Beef Wellington?
Squilliam: [chuckles] No, your name.
SpongeBob: Uhh... err... the fork on the left?
Squidward: Heh. Stop joking. Tell him your name.
SpongeBob: My name? [zoom inside of SpongeBob's brain again where all the SpongeBob's are searching for a name]
Smaller SpongeBob #3: [as he checks file cabinets] What's his name?! What's his name?! I've got nothing on a name!
Smaller SpongeBob #4: [pressing a key on a keyboard connected to a computer] Come on, baby, what's the name?!? [The computer bursts into flames. Panicked shouting is heard from other smaller SpongeBobs as they are running around while papers are flying]
Smaller SpongeBob #5: We threw out his name! [More smaller SpongeBobs begin to run around while more papers are flying. SpongeBob's brain then breaks in half. Cuts back to Squilliam and Squidward with SpongeBob stammering for a moment. Then he splashes water on Squilliam and then starts to bark.]
Squidward: I am so very sorry! I don't know what has gotten into that... [he screams as he notices SpongeBob with a bowl of hot soup by Fred]
SpongeBob: More soup for your armpit? [holds up Fred's arm and throws the soup on his armpits]
Fred: [screams in pain]
SpongeBob: [he runs over to Martha and grabs her head] PLEASE ENJOY THE FOOD. [slams her face into her food then runs up to Nat] Would you like some cheese on that, sir? [pulls out a cheese grater, picks him up and grates his butt with it as Nat screams. Everyone screams and panics]
Squidward: No! Nooo! [Patrick, still tied up, runs out of the kitchen, screaming. Mr. Krabs, still tied up, runs out also.]
Mr. Krabs: RUN FOR YOUR LIVES, EVERYONE! IT'S THE APPETIZER!!! [the appetizer, which has now come to life, bursts through the door and roars. Mr. Krabs is sent flying. Everyone screams and panics. They crash through the windows and the door, running away. Squidward's tuxedo rips in half by itself and falls off, and his Krusty Krab hat and name tag land on him in their proper places. The name tag reads "Squidward Tentacles, Cashier"]
Squilliam: Well, Squiddy, I'm waiting.
Squidward: [his eyes tear up] Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud! This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you. This isn't really my restaurant. I'm just a cashier!
Squilliam: Squidward, I understand. I have a confession to make myself. I made everything up about my life. I have no yachts, jets, or anything. I was only trying to impress you. The horrible, sad truth is, I'm a cashier, too! [He starts to cry and Mr. Krabs plays the violin]
Squidward: Is that true?
Squilliam: Of course not! I'm filthy stinking rich! Come on, everyone. Let's all take a ride in my balloon/casino! [everyone cheers and follows Squilliam. The wallpaper in the Krusty Krab rips off. Squidward sits down and sighs]
SpongeBob: [walks by with a bag of ice on his head] Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you?
Squidward: Oh, the usual. [Mr. Krabs slides over and plays the violin] WOULD YOU GET OUT OF HERE!?


TV narrator: [SpongeBob is watching the movie while eating popcorn] We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot.
Man being chased: [screaming while being chased by a giant robot]
SpongeBob: Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on. 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out! [scene cuts to SpongeBob lying in his bed, whimpering and shivering] What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary? [Gary is sleeping] Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear? [pokes Gary's eye, causing him to wake up] 
Gary: Meow! 
SpongeBob: Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right? 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep. [goes to sleep. Dreams about running from the giant robot from the movie earlier. Scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab, with SpongeBob in the kitchen, panting] Robot! OH MY GOSH! [robot turns out to be a sack of potatoes, a dust pan and broom, and a bucket] Huh? [chuckles nervously. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs holding down his money on his office desk] 
Mr. Krabs: How about a little music to count me money to? [turns on the radio that is next to him] 
Radio DJ:  [From the radio] And now for the #1 song in Bikini Bottom: "Electric Zoo." [techno beat is heard. Mr. Krabs starts counting his money] 
Mr. Krabs: Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad! I love this young people's music! [scene cuts to the kitchen. A buzzer goes off] 
SpongeBob: I SURRENDER!!! Oh... 
Squidward: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams. His hat flies onto Squidward's nose] 
SpongeBob: Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose? 
Squidward: [removes the hat from his nose and puts it back on SpongeBob's head] I'm not wearing your hat on my nose! I'm waiting for #17's order! 
SpongeBob: #17 -- [holds up a tray with food] Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh? 
Squidward: [sarcastically] Hilarious. Just deliver the food. 
SpongeBob: [delivers the food to Thaddeus] There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you? 
Thaddeus: No, I'm not. 
SpongeBob: Well, keep your eyes peeled. [in a deep voice] They're everywhere. Back to work! [he runs away, Thaddeus shrugs his shoulders. SpongeBob walks by Mr. Krabs' office] 
Mr. Krabs: [from office] I feel completely recharged! 
SpongeBob: That sounds like Mr. Krabs. [peeks in the window] 
Mr. Krabs: Come on, little buddy, play it again. [shakes his radio] Please? One more time, for me. 
SpongeBob: That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels "recharged." [laughs] If I didn't know better, I'd say he was... [scene zooms in on SpongeBob] ...a robot! Nah. 
Mr. Krabs: [calls the radio station] Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again. 
Radio DJ: [From the phone] Hmmm... which one, man? 
Mr. Krabs: The one that goes "bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep." 
Radio DJ: No, man, you're thinking of wee-wub-wub-womp-wub-wub-womp.
Mr. Krabs: Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop, [Garbled telephone noise] bee-boo-boo-bop, [Garbled telephone noise] boo-boo-bee-bop? [Garbled telephone noise] Not bee-boo-boo-beep? [Garbled telephone noise] Bop...? [Garbled telephone noise] Beep?! [Garbled telephone noise] Boo-boo-bop?! [SpongeBob screams] 
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot? Nah. [peeks into the window again and sees Mr. Krabs doing a robot dance on his desk. He jumps onto Squidward's arms] Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot! 
Squidward: [picks up SpongeBob off his arms] That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen! [throws him in the kitchen. Squidward laughs, but SpongeBob reappears beside him. Squidward is confused and looks around for how he did it] 
SpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too. 
Squidward: [confused] How did you...? 
SpongeBob: Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter] What is it, boy? 
SpongeBob: Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it. 
Mr. Krabs: Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious? 
Squidward: Umm... yeah, sure. 
Mr. Krabs: Well, let's hear it, lad. 
SpongeBob: Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward? 
Squidward: [chuckles nervously] Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie? 
Mr. Krabs: Why? 
Squidward: It was rated "ARRGH!" [laughing] "Arrgh!" Because it's... about... pirates. 
Mr. Krabs: I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot! 
Squidward: There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you... 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What? What is it, boy? 
SpongeBob: Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? [pretends to cry] 
Mr. Krabs: Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break. Now get back to work! 
SpongeBob: Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either. 
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much! 
SpongeBob: That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love. 
Squidward: No, wait, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What is it, SpongeBob?! 
SpongeBob: I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! [Mr. Krabs makes a blank expression on his face] 
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, Mr. Squidward. 
SpongeBob: [gulps] Squidward? [Mr. Krabs is at his desk writing something when the radio stops working. Radio breaks with electronic breakage sound effect.] 
Mr. Krabs: Aw, me radio died! [takes out the batteries] Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas. [puts the batteries in his back pocket. A bell rings and then Mr. Krabs walks over to a pot of boiling water] Me hard-boiled egg is ready! [picks up a pair of tongs] I can already taste it. Come to Papa. [takes the egg out of the water with his tongs] Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt? [picks up a salt shaker] 
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [breaks the egg and accidentally tosses the full salt shaker into his eyes, then proceeding to scream in pain] OH, MY EYES!!!! [continues screaming] 
SpongeBob: Mr...! [Squidward puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth] 
Squidward: Will you be quiet?! Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like? 
SpongeBob: Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries. 
Squidward: Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?! 
Mr. Krabs: [Barges out; his eyes are piercing red, his pair of the tongs snip, then it shows the batteries in his pocket] AHHHH! AHHHH!! AHHH!!! AHHH!!!! OHH!!! AHHHH!! AHH! AHHH!! AHHH!!! AAAAHHHHH!!!! AAAHH! 
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Mr. Krabs: [continues screaming as he goes into the bathroom] 
Squidward: I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy! 
SpongeBob: [runs over to the phone] Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy! 
Operator: Hello. You've reached the Navy's automated phone service. 
SpongeBob: Squidward! The robots are running the Navy! 
Squidward: NOT THE NAVY!!!! [over loudspeaker] Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! [everyone is silent] Our world! [all the customers run out screaming] What do we do now? 
SpongeBob: I don't know! [notices a nickel] Hey, a nickel! [he points at it] 
Squidward: SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob: Sorry. 
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the bathroom, his eyes back to normal] Ah, that's better. [walks back to his office] Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop. 
Squidward: We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how? 
SpongeBob: Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot. 
Squidward: They poop on the robot? 
SpongeBob: Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information. 
Squidward: I never thought I'd say this but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! [grabs the book titled “How To Torture” and reads it with SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs some rope while Squidward grabs a hammer and a saw. SpongeBob also grabs some old comedy records. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' office, where SpongeBob &amp; Squidward enter] 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hello, boys. [they are at the door with angry expressions on their faces] What can I do for you? [SpongeBob &amp; Squidward lock the door] Heh-heh, why did you lock the door? [nervously as they slowly and menacingly approach him] Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?! [shot of outside the Krusty Krab where loud crashing and everyone screaming can be heard. Back in the office, Squidward ties Mr. Krabs to his office chair] SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!
Squidward: Shut up! [slaps Mr. Krabs] 
Mr. Krabs: Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?! 
Squidward: I said [slaps him again] "shut up!," you bucket of bolts! 
SpongeBob: I can't take it! [runs off, crying] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you okay? 
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch! 
Squidward: No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs. [Mr. Krabs is trying to get out of his chair] 
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. 
Squidward: And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know. 
SpongeBob: Right. [runs up to Mr. Krabs and then slaps him] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first. 
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? [slaps him again] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, let me handle this. [turns a light on Mr. Krabs] Where's Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs: [confused] What are you talkin' about? I'm Mr. Krabs. [Squidward slaps him again] 
Squidward: We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!
SpongeBob: This is one stubborn robot.
Mr. Krabs: [confused, then angrily yells] WHAT?! [his yelling knocks over the light and SpongeBob] You think I'm a ROBOT?!?!
Squidward: We don't think; we know.
Mr. Krabs: That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: [walks over to SpongeBob] He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.
SpongeBob: I got an idea. [pokes Squidward's nose] Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robo tricks. [runs out and returns later] If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. [holds up a blender]
Squidward: SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender. 
SpongeBob: Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his "little buddy."
Squidward: Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.
Squidward: We're just gonna see what your "little buddy" knows. [SpongeBob sets the blender on Mr. Krabs' desk. Squidward holds up a bat]
Mr. Krabs: [panicking] No, wait! What are you going to do to me blender?! That cost me money!
Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs? [shot of the blender] Not talking, eh? [breaks the blender with the bat]
Mr. Krabs: NOOOO! That cost me $24.95! 
SpongeBob: I guess it didn't know anything.
Squidward: Go get the toaster. [SpongeBob gets the toaster then puts it on Mr. Krabs' desk]
Mr. Krabs: No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50! [Squidward breaks the toaster and then SpongeBob sets a food processor on the desk] $62.67! [Squidward breaks it with the bat. SpongeBob picks up a coffee maker and puts it on the desk] Four... well, actually, that one was a gift. [Squidward breaks it] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
SpongeBob: [while trying to put the cash register on Mr. Krabs' desk] This is the last robot, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator. [crying] No! [sobbing and then sobbing louder]
Squidward: I thought you said robots can't cry.
SpongeBob: I also said they couldn't love.
Mr. Krabs: [crying] I loved it like it was me own.
SpongeBob: Uh, at least he's not laughing. 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! [sobbing]
Squidward: SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?
SpongeBob: The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... [slows down, as he realizes his mistake] imagination. [chuckles nervously, timpani noise, as if he anticipates Squidward to be angry at him, then checks his watch] Hey, it's time to feed Gary. [runs out while Squidward smiles nervously at Mr. Krabs and then grabs a broom and sweeps the broken pieces on the floor. Mr. Krabs becomes infuriated, the scene then exits from the office to the exterior of The Krusty Krab outside.]
Mr. Krabs: [Growling, starting the background shaking] SQUIDWARD!!!


SpongeBob: [runs outside to retrieve the newspaper] Gary, the paper's here! [Gary comes out on a motorized skateboard. SpongeBob gives him the paper but keeps the rubber band.] You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section! [shakes the rubber band around for emphasis. Hums while he stretches the rubber band around the middle of his body and snaps it together, turning him into a bowtie-like shape] I am a happy sponge! [runs around, laughing, while Gary is reading the paper]
Gary: [looking slightly annoyed by SpongeBob by rolling his eyes] Meow! [SpongeBob runs into Patrick, who also has a rubber band stretched around him]
Patrick: I see you got the paper. [his rubber band snaps off]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick. [then his rubber band snaps off as well. Patrick clears his throat] Well, I'd better get going.
Patrick: Yep, see you later. [both walk off but then hear a chirping sound and they both quickly run back, with their hands over their ears]
SpongeBob and Patrick: What did you say?
Patrick: Well, I didn't say anything.
SpongeBob: I didn't say anything, either.
SpongeBob and Patrick: See you later then. [both walk off again and the squeaking noise is heard again, so they both run back. This time, they are angry]
SpongeBob: [Pointing at Patrick] Alright, quit messing with me! I know you said something.
Patrick: Ah, but it is you [points] that is messing with me. [both look down to see the squeaking noise is coming from a shaking branch. Patrick points downward.] That's what's messing with us!
SpongeBob: It's a baby scallop.
Patrick: [lifts up his foot with a threatening look on his face, looking as though he is about to smash the scallop] I'll take care of this!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! It's totally helpless. [takes the baby scallop in his hands] It looks like he can't even fly yet.
Patrick: What's the matter, is he stupid?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just a baby. [close-up of the chirping scallop in SpongeBob's hands] He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
Patrick: Well, we can't just leave him out here.
SpongeBob: You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple. [both run in and set the baby scallop on the ground] Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in. [SpongeBob removes his pants and sets it in front of the scallop] There you go. It's the best seat [points to his rear] in the house. [scene cuts to Gary, who does a rimshot]
Patrick: Let me see! [Patrick sticks his whole head inside SpongeBob's pants] Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh! [takes his head out, which is now eaten on the side] I think somebody's hungry!
SpongeBob: [takes out Junior and speaks in baby-talk to it] Is it true? Are you hungry?
Junior: [chirping happily] Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!
SpongeBob: I've got just the thing. [puts Junior on a barrel and takes out a Krabby Patty] How would you like a Krabby Patty? [Junior yelps]
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!
SpongeBob: Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty. [shows Junior a minuscule Krabby Patty]
Junior: [sniffs the patty, then sticks his tongue out in disgust] Blech!
SpongeBob: Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before. [gobbles it and gulps it down]
Patrick: [holds up a doughnut] Let's try a doughnut. [Junior hisses]
SpongeBob: [holds up a tray of French fries] French fries?
Junior: [shaking his head] Unh-unh.
Patrick: [eating the doughnut] A doughnut? [Junior blows a raspberry]
SpongeBob: [holds up an apple] All we have left is this apple. [a worm pokes its head out of the apple]
Worm: Hello, sea creatures! I bring you greetings from Apple World! [Junior chirps in excitement]
SpongeBob: Of course! Scallops love worms. [picks up the worm]
Worm: Huh, wait! We will bury you! [SpongeBob drops it in Junior's mouth]
SpongeBob: Well, you should be good for the rest of the... [Junior cries]
Patrick: What now?
SpongeBob: I don't know! Aww, don't cry. [Junior is still crying]
Patrick: Do something, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah! Look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo! Look at the funny face! [shows SpongeBob has a puppet that looks like him on his hand] Look at the funny face!
Patrick: Wait! I think I might know the problem. [picks up Junior and looks at him] Yep, that's it, alright. [hides it behind his back] Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new. [Junior has a diaper on]
SpongeBob: How did you know?
Patrick: How do you think? [drops his pants showing that he is wearing a diaper] And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.
SpongeBob: Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
Patrick: I know, good thing there's two of us.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
Patrick: Yeah. At least until it's old enough to be on its own. Oh, I wanna be the mom!
SpongeBob: I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
Patrick: You're right. If I was a mom..., [the camera draws back to reveal Patrick's hairy, obese, unsightly form]...this would be kind of shocking. [lifts his arms, revealing armpit hair] Just call me Daddy!
Montage:
Patrick: [softly, from inside the house] It sure is cute when it's asleep.
SpongeBob: [softly, from inside the house] Yeah. [SpongeBob and Patrick watch Junior sleeping] Shh! [both tiptoe out of the room]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob? [goes to what appears to be the right side of the bed]
SpongeBob: [goes to what appears to be the left side] Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.
SpongeBob: Me neither.
[scene zooms out, revealing that Patrick is sleeping on the bottom mattress and SpongeBob is sleeping on the top]
Patrick: Well, good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick. [SpongeBob's mattress slams shut on top of Patrick. Scene cuts to morning] Patrick, breakfast is ready. [SpongeBob is cooking something over at the grill as Patrick walks in, noticing the bunch of food that is on the table]
Patrick: Alright! All this parenting stuff makes me hungry. [lifts the table up as all the food slides down into mouth. He burps, then pats Junior] Hey, Junior, how are you doing today? [smells an odor from Junior] SpongeBob? [adjusts his tie]
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Kid's got a stinky.
SpongeBob: [doing many chores at the same time] Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full. [Patrick guzzles down the coffee as Junior begins to cry]
Patrick: [drinking coffee] Ahh. Wish I could, but I gotta get going.
SpongeBob: Going? Where are you going?
Patrick: [puts on a suit and takes his briefcase] I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?
SpongeBob: You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?
Patrick: I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable. [chuckles as he closes the door]
SpongeBob: Okay. [chuckles weakly. Day turns into night, and Patrick walks in and takes his jacket and hat off]
Patrick: Phew! What a day.
SpongeBob: Oh, great, you're home. Now you can help me with the baby.
Patrick: Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to, but I'm totally beat from work.
SpongeBob: Huh? [Patrick sits down and watches TV. A coconut "clonk" sound effect is heard.]
Patrick: [laughs] That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing the chores] Patrick, what about my break?
Patrick: Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise.
SpongeBob: Uhh, okay, tomorrow.
Narrator: Tomorrow... [scene cuts to Patrick walking in at night and taking his stuff off]
Patrick: Phew! Another tough day. [walks by SpongeBob, who is still doing the same chores from yesterday]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break.
Patrick: Work was a killer. I need my chair. [sits down and watches TV again]
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing chores] Patrick, I really need my...
Patrick: Tomorrow for sure.
Narrator: Tomorrow for sure... [scene cuts to a tired SpongeBob doing the same chores as Patrick walks by]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: I'll get to it eventually...
Narrator: Eventually... [scene cuts to SpongeBob still doing the chores but even more tired]
SpongeBob: Uhhh?
Patrick: Uhhh.
Narrator: Uhhh... [scene cuts to Patrick watching TV as an angry SpongeBob walks in and turns on the lights]
SpongeBob: Patrick Star, we need to talk.
Patrick: Just one more minute, I gotta...
SpongeBob: Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man! [turns off the TV]
Patrick: Hey, I'm missin' the coconut! [he gives SpongeBob an angry look]
SpongeBob: You haven't been helping at all with Junior! [pulls in baby stroller] We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.
Patrick: I changed his diaper!
SpongeBob: Yeah, once.
Patrick: He's only this big. [shows with his hands on how big Junior is] How many diapers could he possibly use?
SpongeBob: [opens up a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: Oh, that's not so much.
SpongeBob: [points over to the corner of the room where there are two bags and a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: [nervously] So?
SpongeBob: [opens up the refrigerator, full of diapers] Hmmm? [pulls the cover off the couch, revealing it to be diapers] Hmmm? [tears the wallpaper off the wall, revealing a bunch of diapers behind it] Hmmm?! [points outside to a garbage truck loading a bunch of diapers into the dumpster. Patrick quivers at the sight of it]
Patrick: [his eyes fill with tears] I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh! [sobs as he looks at SpongeBob as he smiles] I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise. [scene cuts to next day]
SpongeBob: So, what's the plan for the day?
Patrick: No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal.
SpongeBob: [gives Patrick his briefcase as he departs] Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: [waving] Six o'clock.
Patrick: [waving] Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock. [cuts to a time card]
Narrator: 12:00 midnight.
[Patrick walks in with a lampshade over his head, giggling and turns on the light]
Patrick: Oh, that was some party! [SpongeBob is wearing his mother-like clothing and he gives Patrick a bitter look] Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior. [SpongeBob now looks at Patrick angrily as he taps his foot] What? What?!
SpongeBob: Oh, nothing.
Patrick: Oh, what a relief. [takes the lampshade off his head and puts it on SpongeBob] For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.
SpongeBob: [takes the lampshade off his head] Do you remember what you said to me this morning?
Patrick: Somethin' about root beer, right?
SpongeBob: [takes a deep breath, flatly] No.
Patrick: Oh, wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.
SpongeBob: Does... [imitates Patrick in a mocking tone with a goofy look on his face] "You can take the night off, pal!" [normal voice] ...ring a bell?
Patrick: [raspberry] I don't need this. [walks outside]
SpongeBob: What?! [walks to the door] Where do you think you're going?
Patrick: [opens his rock] I'm going back to work! [gets in and closes his rock]
SpongeBob: Work?! [growls and rips off his hairpiece]
[Cut to SpongeBob, not wearing his mother-like clothing anymore, walking outside to Patrick's rock. He opens it up, and finds Patrick in his easy chair, watching TV]
Patrick: [two "clonk" sounds are heard on the TV; laughs] He got hit in the head with two coconuts!
SpongeBob: [angrily] So, this is work?
Patrick: You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes, I gotta move the antenna, sometimes, I lose the remote, [looks at his rear] and sometimes, my butt itches real bad!
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Oh, you poor, poor thing. By the way, you forgot your briefcase! [he pulls a briefcase out from behind his back, and opens it up to reveal that it is filled with donuts and ice cream sundaes as he angrily dumps it all over Patrick]
Patrick: [quietly but furiously] Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?
[SpongeBob is enraged. He balls his fists and fumes so hard, his entire body shakes. Then he loses his temper and goes ballistic on Patrick, and his face morphs into a stereotypical Asian face with lots of teeth.]
SpongeBob: [Screaming intensely] OVERTIME?!
[SpongeBob jumps into Patrick's rock, and they both begin to argue intensely.]
Patrick: Yeah, overtime, pal!
SpongeBob: [overlapping Patrick] Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!
Patrick: You know what that means?
SpongeBob: And that's the kind of work you're doing?
Patrick: ​It means working when you're just too tired to work!
SpongeBob: Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!
[Junior is heard beginning to chirp]
Patrick: You just keep going on working and working!
SpongeBob: ​You never help! NEVER!
[Junior's chirping intensifies, which makes the two finally stop arguing and listen to it]
Patrick: [still mad] There's that stupid noise again!
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.
[Patrick and SpongeBob see Junior teetering on the edge of the window of SpongeBob's house, ready to fly.]
Patrick: [calmly] Oh.
[All at once, Patrick and SpongeBob are struck with shock by what's really happening.]
Both: [eyes bulge in horror, screaming] JUNIOR!
[Junior jumps down the window. SpongeBob and Patrick quickly run to catch Junior but they slam on SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob then bounces out of Patrick's stomach]
SpongeBob: [Frantic] Did you catch him?!
Patrick: [looking sadly at his empty hands] No.
Both: We're bad parents! [They break down sobbing. Then they stop when they notice that chirping Junior is flying above them.]
SpongeBob: Junior? He's flying!
Patrick: I guess he's all grown up. [Junior kisses SpongeBob then flies off] Hey, what about Daddy? [Junior drops a coconut on Patrick's head for his laziness then kisses him] That's my boy.
SpongeBob: Goodbye!
Patrick: [the coconut falls down] Goodbye, Junior!
[they watch Junior fly away]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.
Patrick: This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.
SpongeBob: Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.
Patrick: Yeah... Let's have another.
[SpongeBob looks shocked]

 	  	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
Narrator: A slow day at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out. [holds up a patty in each hand] Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become... [throws them on the floor and Patrick slides the patties across the room]
Patrick: A one-way ticket to PAIN! [slams into the wall by Mr. Krabs' office. Mr. Krabs' window breaks off the wall caused by the impact.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [puts down his writing]
SpongeBob: [slides while on Patrick's mouth] Heave-ho! [slams into the wall and the place shakes]
Mr. Krabs: [exits his office] What the devil fish is going on out here?! [SpongeBob is on Patrick's mouth] Time is money! And if you boys is wasting time, then you're wasting money! [walks up to SpongeBob] And that's just sick!
SpongeBob: But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.
Mr. Krabs: What stupid barnacle told you that?
Squidward: Uhh… [nervously covers his face up with a magazine]
Mr. Krabs: Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me. [scene cuts to the three of them standing in front of Mr. Krabs' house] Now, are you men ready for your super...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Superrrr...!
Mr. Krabs: ...special...
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...speciallll...!
Mr. Krabs: [whispers] ...secret...
SpongeBob and Patrick: [whisper] ...seeeeecret...
Mr. Krabs: ...assignment?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [screaming] Assignment?!? I beg of you, Mr. Krabs! Put us out of our misery! [SpongeBob and Patrick get worried]
Mr. Krabs: The two of you are to paint the inside of me house! [opens his front door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! [both jump out with excitement]
Mr. Krabs: [charges them from the right, in a stern tone] But, let me give you two a warning. [holds up two buckets of paint] This here paint is absolutely permanent. [shoves cans toward SpongeBob and Patrick] It will never come off. [angrily] So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off... [holds up two empty plaques, each with their names on it] …and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job. [shuts the door with them inside his house]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, SpongeBob? [They see Mr. Krabs' wall; it is covered head to toe in memorabilia]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on. [puts his paint on the floor] Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?
Patrick: [puts his paint on the floor as well] No way, SpongeBob. We're not getting paid to move stuff.
SpongeBob: Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.
Patrick: Well, that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final.
SpongeBob: Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.
Patrick: Good, just don't pay me.
SpongeBob: First, we need to set up the tarp. [holds up a tarp]
Patrick: Tarp ahoy! [spreads the tarp on the floor, but the camera pans to reveal it's a tiny piece]
SpongeBob: We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick. [scene cuts to more tarp on the floor but not the entire floor] Now that's what I'm talking about! [nervous tone] Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.
Patrick: That will never ever come off.
SpongeBob: And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.
Patrick: And mount them on the wall. [SpongeBob takes a screwdriver and tries opening the lid] Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob! [screaming] CAREFUL, SPONGEBOB!!!
SpongeBob: [holds the lid] Patrick, the lid's already off.
Patrick: Oh... [happily] now it's my turn! [takes out a battle ax and hits the paint can with it. SpongeBob grabs the can]
SpongeBob: [nervously] I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick.
[SpongeBob carefully opens the lid with same screwdriver as before. The lid opens, and a blob of paint jumps out. SpongeBob and Patrick scream. The blob bounces off a piece of tarp. SpongeBob and Patrick scream louder. The blob bounces off eight pieces of tarp, then lands back into the can]
Patrick: Well, that was a rip-off. [SpongeBob wipes sweat off]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready. [holds up his big brush] Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush. [throws the big brush to the right of him then takes another small brush and gets a hair out of his nose. Patrick gets all his hairs out of his nose on his brush. SpongeBob dips the brush into the can and then faces the wall] All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go...
Narrator: One hour later.
SpongeBob: [still standing in the same spot, while sweating nervously] ...Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall!
Narrator: Two hours later.
SpongeBob: [still standing in the same spot and sweating] ...I'm getting to the painting...
Narrator: Three hours later. [the camera zooms out to reveal Patrick holding the timecard. Patrick is also sweating]
Patrick: [to SpongeBob] Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards.
SpongeBob: [still standing on the same spot and sweating] No problem. Here I go. [makes a line of paint going down the wall. He smiles. The paint starts going down, but SpongeBob blows it one direction then another then another until he gets a blow dryer and blows the paint off the wall. Blows the steam off the hairdryer like a gun creating a giant paint bubble] Yeah. Huh? [notices the big paint bubble] Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?
Patrick: Oh, I know... [takes a wand, dips it in the paint then blows a big bubble] TWO giant paint bubbles!
SpongeBob: Noooooo!! [two giant paint bubbles merge into one] Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I don't think this bubble can get much bigger.
Patrick: [finds a bicycle pump and attaches it to the bubble] Nonsense! [starts pumping the bubble, inflating it further]
SpongeBob: Pat, no!! [The bubble pops and the paint splatters all over the wall, covering up all the old brown spots. SpongeBob moves out of the way for the last bit of paint to splash on the wall] We did it! [checks the area] We painted the whole house! And without getting a drop of paint on anything but th-- [shocked] FLAPPIN' FLOTSAM, WHAT'S THAT!?!?!?!?! [Mr. Krabs' dollar on the wall has a dot of paint on it upon closer inspection. SpongeBob's eyes crack, break, and drip on the floor. He then falls over. He then wakes up and his eyes recover] We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?
Patrick: Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!
SpongeBob: That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
Patrick: I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.
SpongeBob: Okay, [takes the dollar off the wall] this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off. [tries to wipe the paint off with his tie but makes the paint even more noticeable] There! I think I got it. [notices the paint more. He becomes nervous so he wipes it more but the dollar becomes completely covered in paint. He screams]
Patrick: Oh, now I see it!
SpongeBob: This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon! And when he sees what we did to his first dollar… [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick's butt on the wall while Mr. Krabs is enjoying some tea by the fire]
Both: [while holding their butts] AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: [claps his hands over SpongeBob's mouth] Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something! [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing by a washing machine]
SpongeBob: Did it work? [Patrick comes out from the washing machine with the dollar, still with paint on it, in his hands; he also has a bra on his head]
Patrick: Nope. [scene cuts to SpongeBob sanding the dollar in Patrick's hand]
SpongeBob: Did it work? [Patrick's hands are gone]
Patrick: Nope.
Patrick: [scene cuts to SpongeBob squirting sulfuric acid out of a fire hose. Patrick screams in pain]
SpongeBob: Did it work? [Patrick holds up the dollar that left a hole in his body from the force of the acid, except for the part blocked by his arms]
Patrick: Nope. [scene cuts to SpongeBob banging on the dollar Patrick is holding, while Patrick is wearing a neck brace and has a black eye; behind them is a huge assortment of weapons and tools that apparently didn't work either] Oof! Oof! Oof!
SpongeBob: [holds a club] Nothing's working!
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob, we're not cavemen! [walks over to a computer] We have technology! [picks up the computer and angrily grunts as he smashes it on the dollar]
SpongeBob: It didn't work.
Patrick: [Ranting as he puts the computer down] This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place...! I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...
SpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.
Patrick: I don't see where you're going with this... [takes out his wallet and pulls out a dollar] Hey, a dollar!
SpongeBob: Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick!! No! [Patrick puts his dollar in a vending machine] PATRICK, NO! WHY DID YOU PUT IT... [his dollar comes out] AHH! GRAB IT, PAT, GRAB IT! HURRY, HURRY! I... [Patrick pushes it back in] Aww, Pat, no, no! [dollar comes out again] GET IT, PAT! GET IT! GET IT, GET IT! [Patrick forcefully shoves it back in again with both hands.] No-o-o-o-oh!
Patrick: [eats a chocolate bar as he approaches an annoyed SpongeBob] ...Wanna bite?
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, we still have time! [looks in a mirror] Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome! [Mr. Krabs is approaching the door while singing, offscreen]
SpongeBob's reflection: You're on your own, pal. [walks away]
SpongeBob: [screams as he runs in circles around Patrick] Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea! [Mr. Krabs enters his dark house where all the lights are off]
Mr. Krabs: What the…?
SpongeBob: [stammering] We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.
Patrick: Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you. [lights turn on; they are grinning suspiciously]
Mr. Krabs: You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.
SpongeBob: Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going... [he and Patrick are about to leave]
Mr. Krabs: Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!
SpongeBob: [stops leaving as he and Patrick kneel down and beg] Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!
Patrick: [begging] Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!
Mr. Krabs: Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! What's this?
SpongeBob: [begging] It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!
Patrick: [begging] We didn't do it on purpose!
Both: [begging] Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!
Patrick: [begging] I don't want to be butt-less!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own. [wall is decorated with tiny ships] That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar!... [runs over to a bunch of dolls lined up perfectly, except one] ...rama! [Patrick and SpongeBob are confused] All the dolls in this doll-a-rama were perfectly aligned! [straightens one of the dolls to an upright position]
Doll: Mama.
Mr. Krabs: And you boys thought I wouldn't notice! Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right, boys, you're free to go. [runs into a long pile of paintings] Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all. [takes the painting of a crying clown off] Or this one. [takes the painting of a car race off] Or this one. [takes the painting off. SpongeBob and Patrick are anxious] Or this one. [takes it off] Or this one. [takes it off] Or this one. [takes the painting of a banana off] Or this one. [takes a painting of Painty the Pirate off. SpongeBob is behind the painting he just took off]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, you know, just hanging around.
Patrick: [gives a thumbs-down] Boooooooooooo.
Mr. Krabs: Get down onto the floor, boy. [SpongeBob stretches his body to the floor. Mr. Krabs is now annoyed] Alright, now you're just being silly.
SpongeBob: [Mr. Krabs takes him off the wall and throws him aside] No, No, Mr. Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?
SpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
Patrick: We're so sorry!
Mr. Krabs: [looks at the dollar again then looks at SpongeBob and Patrick] And then did you draw on it with crayon?! [two dollar signs and a smiley face are drawn on the dollar with crayon. SpongeBob turns to Patrick, who is grinning nervously]
Patrick: [holding a green crayon] I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it?
Mr. Krabs: All right, boys! You know what I've got to do now?
SpongeBob: You mean our butts?
Patrick: Can I use mine one last time? [Mr. Krabs takes the dollar and licks it. The paint comes off then Mr. Krabs puts the dollar back up on the wall]
Mr. Krabs: There we go, good as new.
Both: [They are shocked beyond belief. Stammering] But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [frowns then smiles] Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!
Mr. Krabs: Nah, I just like to mess with ya! [Laughs. SpongeBob scowls. He and Patrick glare at Mr. Krabs; they storm out in disgust. Mr. Krabs laughs so hard he spits all over the walls] The old man's still got it! [continues laughing, but the paint comes off the wall from all the spit. He finally stops laughing to see his whole place a mess] Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.


 
[Montage of aspects of the Krusty Krab are shown, starting the episode]
Narrator: Welcome aboard. If you're watching this video, then let me be the first to say: Congratulations. [a rainbow with the word "Congratulations" appears] You've recently been hired in the Krusty Krab [a spatula, a hat, and a bucket appear in SpongeBob's hands] and this is your first official day of training.
SpongeBob: Can I make a Krabby Patty now?
Narrator: Oh no, you've got a lot to learn before you're ready to make a Krabby Patty. As you can see by this graph... [Scene cuts to a giraffe] *ahem* graph. [A graph is shown. The Krusty Krab is moving up.] You have been employed in one of the most successful restaurants in Bikini Bottom. But it didn't get that way over night... [it is night time] because the store closes at 6. [scene cuts to picture of Mr. Krabs and the Krusty Krab behind him] No, the story of the Krusty Krab is the story of one man's hard work, perseverance, vision, determination and sweat. [scene zooms into one of Mr. Krabs' armpits] But mostly his sweat. [scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding to the right and stops on the screen, followed by sparkles] From Humble Beginnings. [scene cuts to a sepia picture of Mr. Krabs as a child, walking up to a soda machine with a quarter on a string wrapped around his hand] You may think that Mr. Eugene H. Krabs, owner and founder of Krusty Krab Inc., has always been the financial wizard he is today. [Mr. Krabs puts in his quarter then takes it out; it's attached to a piece of rope with a hole in the quarter] And you're right! [Mr. Krabs laughs while drinking his soda. Scene cuts to a tired Mr. Krabs, sitting depressed in a room with light at the window] After the war, Krabs stayed secluded in a deep depression that seemed endless. [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, now a retirement home with elderly fish outside playing shuffleboard] But then his luck changed when he acquired a bankrupt retirement home and with a few minor alterations, the Krusty Krab was born! [Mr. Krabs paints a giant "K" with a bucket full of red paint, on a sign outside. We can hear a sound of a baby crying in the background]
Baby: *waahh waahh*
Narrator: [Scene cuts to a Krabby Patty with a light shining on it] Sounds like a lot of...
Hoopla fish: Hoopla!
Narrator: Sounds like a lot of...
Hoopla fish: Hoopla!
Narrator: Sounds like a...
Hoopla fish: Hoopla! [Scrolls over to a small fish yelling] HOOPLA! [someone off screen throws a brick on the fish, knocking him unconscious. Screen scrolls back to the patty]
Narrator: Sounds like a lot of hoopla to make over a little Krabby Patty, right? Haha, wrong! [scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding to the right again] The Krusty Krab today. [scene cuts to a series of close-ups in the Krusty Krab. Then scene cuts to a view of the inside of the Krusty Krab where customers are eating Krabby Patties] To keep up with today's demanding customers, no expense has been spared to acquire all the latest achievements in fast-food technology.
Mr. Krabs: [holds up a spatula in his left hand] This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism. [now standing at the register] Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch! [now holding some ice cubes] These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported. [holds up a straw] This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine. [puts the straw in the cup and drinks it] And most importantly, [holds up some ketchup packets] You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee.
Narrator: [SpongeBob is standing there when a packet of ketchup, spatula, a cash register, cup, and ice cubes appear around him] All of this modernization seems a little overwhelming, doesn't it? [the items spin around him] Well luckily for you, Mr. Krabs fear of robot overlords keeps the balance of technology in check. [items disappear and SpongeBob floats to the right. The scene changes to SpongeBob standing next to Squidward near the cash register] But if modernization is the heart of the Krusty Krab, then employees are the liver and gallbladder. [close-up of SpongeBob] Let's see if you got what it takes. Hmmm, poised, confident, and a smile that says, "Hello world! May I take your order?" You've got the makings of a good employee, Mr. SquarePants. But for every good employee, there is one who is not so good. [close-up of Squidward reading his dance magazine] Let's see, inattentive, impatient, a glazed look in the eyes. [close-up of the button Squidward is wearing on his shirt] Look carefully at the "I Really Wish I Weren't Here Right Now!" button. There's a name for employees like this, but we'll call him Squidward.
Squidward: I'm getting paid overtime for this, right Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [in his office] Sorry, can't hear you! [scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding to the right]
Narrator: Training.
SpongeBob: Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?
Narrator: No, you can't make a Krabby Patty without understanding the phrase POOP.
SpongeBob: POOP?
Narrator: Once you understand POOP, you'll understand your place at the Krusty Krab. But what does POOP mean? [SpongeBob shrugs his arms] It's actually a carefully organized code. Watch closely. People Order Our Patties.
SpongeBob: Oh, POOP! [smiles proudly]
Narrator: Looks like Mr. SquarePants understands POOP. [scene cuts to a customer walking up to Squidward] Here's a typical customer. I wonder what he wants. Well, if we just remember POOP, we can figure it out.
Harold: I'd like to order- [screen freezes to a quiz]
Narrator: Do you think he's going to order: A: A sofa, B: An expensive haircut, or C: A patty?
Harold: One patty please.
Narrator: Ah, POOP! You never let us down! [scene cuts to a giant Krabby Patty] Now that you understand POOP, I bet you think you're ready to make a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Krabby Patty! [panting towards the Krabby Patty but once he gets too close, he gets splattered on the screen with a fly swatter]
Narrator: Ha-ha! Not so fast, Eager McBeaver. We haven't even talked about: [scene cuts to a toilet] Personal Hygiene. [toilet flushes. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in front of a sink] Every employee at the Krusty Krab must comply with a strict set of personal hygiene guidelines. [SpongeBob turns the faucet on] Okay, Mr. SquarePants, are you ready to prepare for your shift? [SpongeBob lathers his hands] A good employee always washes himself thoroughly. Be sure to get under those fingernails. [SpongeBob nods and rubs a bit harder] And don't forget about the knuckles. [SpongeBob rubs a bit harder] And make sure those palms are squeaky clean. [SpongeBob rubs the hardest he can] All right, let's see those hands! [holds up his arms but it is invisible from rubbing so much] Now that's thorough, HAHA. [chuckles. Scene cuts to SpongeBob's shiny boots] After making sure your boots are polished, your face is clear of any blemishes or boils, [SpongeBob cuts his boil off with scissors] and your hair is neat and tidy, [SpongeBob lifts up his hat, sprays a little hairspray on a single hair to make it straight, then puts his hat back on] you are ready to start the day! Now let's see how Squidward prepares for his shift. [one of the bathroom stall doors opens to show Squidward sitting on the toilet with his dance magazine on his lap. He then notices that people are looking at him. He laughs nervously and shuts the stall door shut] REMEMBER, NO EMPLOYEE WANTS TO BE A SQUIDWARD. [a giant Krabby Patty appears on the screen again] Now that you're clean and hygienic, I bet you think you're ready to make that Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [yells in excitement] I'm ready! [splits into two SpongeBobs] I'm ready!! [splits into more SpongeBobs] I'm ready!! [splits himself into more SpongeBobs] I'm ready!!! [fly swatters splat all of them on the screen]
Narrator: Whoa there! We have a few more topics to cover first. [scene cuts to food and a spatula lying on a table] Your Work Station. [scene cuts to SpongeBob vacuuming on top of the stove] It's important to keep your area tidy and free of droppings. But a clean workstation is only part of the job. [scene cuts to SpongeBob thinking of a Krabby Patty in a thought bubble of his] To make the vision in your head a reality, you'll need supplies. And a good employee always keeps his supplies well-organized. [SpongeBob opens up a cabinet, then opens the bottom drawer to reveal a bunch of folders with names of condiments and ingredients on there] Very nice, Mr. SquarePants, not a pickle out of place. [SpongeBob peeks out the kitchen door] Now let's see how Squidward keeps his work station. [Squidward's work station is covered in ketchup and mustard. The octopus is sprawled out sleeping with a dance magazine on his face and a "Do not disturb" sign hanging on his left feet. He wakes up]
Squidward: Huh? [shouts] Oh! [falls on the floor. The cash register drawer opens up and conks Squidward in the head]
Narrator: Don't worry, Squidward, Mr. SquarePants can cover for you. [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to the grill] Now that your workstation is up and running, perhaps you think you're ready to make the world-famous Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob barks like a dog then runs around the room. Narrator laughs] Calm down. [a bone is thrown at him then he grabs it with his teeth and gnaws it] There's plenty of time left. We have to make sure you're ready for the psychological aspect of the job: [A execution chair is seen] Interfacing with your Boss. [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Mr. Krabs in his office]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?
Mr. Krabs: No.
Narrator: Good job, Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: [runs up to the camera] Can I make a Krabby Patty now- [scene cuts to Patrick walking into the Krusty Krab]
Narrator: Now we go from behind the scenes to the front lines, where we'll examine the most important aspect of the industry, the customer. Or as we like to say, the "Krustomer"!
Patrick: [stops] Who said that? Are you a ghost?
Narrator: Like precious, precious blood in an animal, customers are what makes the Krusty Krab strong and alive.
Patrick: Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me.
Squidward: Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?
Patrick: Uhh... I'll have an uhh... uhh... uhh... ah... [falls asleep and snores until Squidward snaps at him causing him to wake up] Huh? What's that?
Squidward: Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else.
Narrator: Ah-ah-ah, Squidward, remember what Mr. Krabs says.
Mr. Krabs: [A cut-out of Mr. Krabs and the sentence "The money is always right!" are seen] The money is always right!
Patrick: The ceiling is right, Squidward. You're not a very good employee.
Squidward: Fine! May I please take your order?
Patrick: I'll have uhh... uhhhh... [drones again as Squidward gets mad and grabs the cash register]
Narrator: We'll check up on these two later. [scene cuts to a siren] Right now, it's important that we discuss an Emergency Situation! [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing by a Krabby Patty looking around for something] Like the lost gold of Atlantis, many consider the Krabby Patty to be a treasure. And as with every treasure, there's a thief ready to steal it. So it's up to you to be the watchful eyes of... [the Krabby Patty moves as metal legs come out of it and it walks off] What's this? [Plankton is on the patty] It's Mr. Krabs business rival, Plankton!
Plankton: Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs! Your secret formula is finally mine! [scene cuts to SpongeBob with a face of shock]
Narrator: He's stealing the formula! What are you going to do, Mr. SquarePants?! [SpongeBob screams and runs around the restaurant. Mr. Krabs walks up to Plankton as he and the patty are going really slow]
Plankton: You'll never catch me, Krabs! Not after I switch into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE! [whips the Krabby Patty into going faster, but only slightly] Hi-ya! [mechanical legs whirring, Mr. Krabs grabs the patty] I knew I should've gotten the turbo. [SpongeBob is still screaming and knocking over tables and chairs] Hear me, Krabs! You'll take this Krabby Patty from me when you pry it from my cold, dead... [Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton, who is now talking in a high-pitched voice in fast motion] Felicitations, malefactors! I am encountering my minions. And I know just how to speak their language- [Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton back to the Chum Bucket, him seeing SpongeBob is still screaming.]
Narrator: And so, another emergency is avoided, thanks to Mr. SquarePants. [scene cuts to Squidward and Patrick, Patrick is still saying: "Uhhhhhh..." Squidward looks annoyed] Let's check in on Squidward again. Psst, Squidward.
Squidward: Huh?
Narrator: Just remember: POOP.
Squidward: Patrick, if I could make a suggestion. Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?
Patrick: Great idea, Squidward! One Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: [sighs] Will that be for here or to go? [closes his mouth]
Patrick: Uhhh... [Squidward bangs his head on the register]
Narrator: Hang in there, Squidward, it's all part of the job. [scene cuts to a shot of the Krusty Krab training manual] Now that you've learned the basics of your training, it's time for the moment you've been waiting for. [a blue screen appears with the Krabby Patty slowly coming closer to the screen.] Da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, Da-da-da-da-da-da-daa Da-da-da-la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, tssshh Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa-da-da-da-da-daa, Ti-ta-ti-ti-ta-ti-ti-ta-ta-ta-la-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba-baa, Ti-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-taa, Ti-ta-ti-li [gasps, then resumes] Ti-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-ta-ti-ti-ta-ti-ti-taaaaa. Preparing the Krabby Patty! At the center of every great dynasty is the crown jewel, which keeps it alive and thriving! For the Krusty Krab, this is the Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob licks the poster.] And now you, the humble employee of the industry, the all too necessary human resource that keeps this business afloat will earn the sacred and dark secrets of how to prepare with your very own hands... [SpongeBob gasps in joy.] the sumptuous, the lip moistening, spine tingling, heart stopping pleasure center that is the Krabby Patty! Are you ready? [SpongeBob nods excitedly.] Are you sure? [SpongeBob nods harder but half of his face tears apart.] Okay! The secret formula is- [Cut to credits]


Narrator: Welcome to SpongeBob's House Party, with your host, Patchy the Pirate. There'll be punch, cookies, explosions, and a brand-new episode of SpongeBob SquarePants!
Old-time crowd: Hooray!
Narrator: Now live, from Encino, California, get ready for a warm embrace from our party host, Patchy the Pirate!
Patchy: Hey, get off my lawn! Party? [takes a party sign off his door] There ain't no party here. Go away!
Potty: Bawk, come on in!
Patchy: Hush, Potty, can't you see I'm trying to keep out the riffraff?
Potty: Riffraff? That's our television audience, barnacle breath!
Patchy: Oh, of course it is! I was just fooling! Welcome! [gasps] Say, you didn't bring SpongeBob with you, did you? Gee, I sure hope he got his invitation.
[the scene fades to SpongeBob and Patrick receiving their invitations]
SpongeBob: I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation!
Patrick: Me neither.
SpongeBob: Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire. [he and Patrick throw their invitations in a camp fire and warm their hands]
Patchy: Ah, well, come on in. Let me introduce you around. This here's Minnie Mermaid. She's cooling off on account of she's been dancing her scales off, isn't that right, Minnie, huh, takin' a little breakie poo?
Minnie: No, Patchy. Actually, I'm in here because if I wasn't, I would die.
Patchy: Ha, ha! That's the spirit! [Patchy strikes his hook into Minnie's pool, causing water to spurt out. Minnie nervously tries to stop the leak]
Patchy: Huh, let's see, who else haven't you met? That's Longbeard the pirate. Hey, there Longbeard, long time no see!
Neptune: Who dares to interrupt Neptune?
Patchy: Sorry about that, Neppy. That's Neptune. [unenthusiastically] He's king of the sea. [to two guests] You kids having fun? [Kids are chuckling] He-he.. whew! Hosting a party is hard work alright. That reminds me of a time when SpongeBob was hosting a party. Hey, you kids want to see that cartoon? [camera moves up and down] You do? Well then, launch the cartoon!
[episode starts]
Narrator: Ah, the Barg'n-Mart. A consumer's paradise of brand-like items, stocked as far as the eye can see. [SpongeBob is running down the aisles trying to get to the check-out counter as soon as possible]
SpongeBob: Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou!
Lou:  Uh, that's great, SpongeBob. $1.42. 
SpongeBob: But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records. [writes the record down in a book] 19 seconds.
Lou: Okay, so it's a $1.42.
SpongeBob: Sign here please. [Lou signs at the places that SpongeBob points] Initial here, and here, and here, and here. [SpongeBob notices a picture of Lou from a while back] Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here! [picture shows a happy Lou] Look at you, so young and happy! [puts the picture down and we see a sad Lou] Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? "Plan Your Own Party Kit"? Hey Lou, how much?
Lou: For the Plan Your Own Party kit? Oh, we're having a special on those. Uh, they're free. But you have to leave...[scowls] right now.
[scene cuts to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Let's see Gary, according to the "Plan Your Own Party Kit," invitations are the first order of business.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [reads first thing on list] "A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success." Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends.
Fred's dad: [reads invitation] Who the barnacle is SpongeBob SquarePants? [Mable peeks from around the corner]
Mable: I believe you went to kindergarten with him, dear.
Fred's dad: Kindergarten, huh? [Dad shows a picture of SpongeBob and his Kindergarten class] Oh yeah, SquarePants. Well, I guess it's time to move again.
SpongeBob: Boy, Gary, this "Plan Your Own Party Kit" is a real life-saver. [mixing ingredients and reading a cook book] How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream. [takes a little taste] Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta' this world! [timer goes off] My piñata! [takes out the piñata from the oven and he squeals; he tosses it around] Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. [he puts it on the table] The "Plan Your Own Party Kit" suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs. [puts eggs in the piñata]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good question Gary, but not to worry. The "Plan Your Own Party Kit" warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule! [takes out list] 8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution. [list rolls across the table] At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades. [list rolls along the wall] 9:38: charity apple-bob. [list is still rolling around] 9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice. [winks at Gary. The list stops on SpongeBob's head] At 10:09, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success. This is gonna be the coolest party ever! [puts a party hat on Gary's shell. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Ha, ha! Looks like it's smooth party sailing for SpongeBob so far. Now it's time for me to get my own party underway! Gather around, ye scurvy landlubbers, it's time to learn the peg legged dance o' happiness. [lays out a dance mat] Oh, it's quite simple really, all you need is a peg leg and some patience. And my instructional video series, only $29.95.
Potty: Bawk! How tacky. [flies off]
Patchy: It's a $40 value, Potty! [yelling] A $40 value! Now, it's very easy and loads of fun.
Salt Water Sam: Hey, everybody, the band's here.
[party guests cheer off-screen]
Patchy: Band? What band?
Potty: Bawk, the band I hired for the party. [Patchy was laughing]
Patchy: A jolly idea, Potty. A little live musical get me shindig dug. Who'd you get? [a picture of every group is shown as Patchy says their name] Barnacle Bill and the Seven Seas?
Potty: No.
Patchy: Seaweed Sally and her Cackling Turtle?
Potty: No.
Patchy: Oh, oh, I know: The First Mates.
Potty: No.
Patchy: Saltwater Sam, featuring the Brine Brothers.
Potty: No.
Patchy: Uh, Rusty Hinges and the Boys from the Brig?
Potty: They broke up years ago.
Patchy: Well, who else is there?
Potty: The Bird Brains!
Patchy: Oh.. [laughs, but then chuckles in confusion]
Potty: The Bird Brains--They're better than all those other bands.
Patchy: But they're just a bunch of birds.
Lead Singer: Hello, Encino! [The Bird Brains begin playing heavy metal music]
Patchy: Potty, that's the worst sea shanty I've ever heard! I certainly hope it doesn't get any louder. Ohh! [A blast of heavy metal rock music sends a screaming Patchy flying backwards out of the house, blasting him through six more houses before slamming face-first into a metal telephone pole. Back at the party, the band continues to play; Patchy enters his house while covered with debris] No, no, No! Stop the music! [yells as he runs to the band and the music stops] Stop! Look, boys, I know that you fellas sound good around the birdbath, but this here is basic cable! This is the big time! I'm afraid it's time for you to walk the plank.
Lead Singer: You mean we're fired?
Patchy: No. [Patchy and the band go to the plank.] Go on, start jumping, or you'll be dealing with the business end of me sword! [waves his sword at them, laughing. The birds just fly away] No! I forgot that you're birds! Ahh! [breaks down sobbing, whacking himself on the head with the sword]
Narrator: [screen: PLEASE STAND BY] While Patchy pulls himself together, let's see how SpongeBob's party is shaping up. [shows SpongeBob's house decorated]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come! [looks at his watch] Don't worry too much, Gary, it's only ten seconds past 8:00. [gasps] Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations. 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed! [cries] No one's coming. I'm the worst host ever! [doorbell rings] Oh, the first guest, and only forty seconds late. [opens door to see Patrick]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Welcome, Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?
Patrick: Sure? [SpongeBob runs over and pours a glass]
SpongeBob: Did you have any trouble finding the place? [gives Patrick the glass] Here you are!
Patrick: Thanks. [drinks some punch]
SpongeBob: So, the punch okay?
Patrick: Not bad, not bad.
SpongeBob: Hmm, nice weather we're having.
Patrick: It's been very mild, yes.
SpongeBob: Yep, it's mild season. [nervously laughs] Ahem. So, you read any... [doorbell rings] Oh, more party guests! [Mr. Krabs has walked in with a purple coat on] Welcome, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch.
Mr. Krabs: Don't mind if I do! [drops his coat on Gary. Gary sticks his eyes out of the sleeves]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [looks over his party list] Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot... [hands Patrick and Mr. Krabs name tags] These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions. [doorbell rings] Oh, more guests! [Patrick tries to read his name tag upside down]
Patrick: Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.
Mr. Krabs: No, you dumb bunny, it says, "Hello, my name is Patrick."
Patrick: [shakes Mr Krabs' hand] Nice to meet you Patrick.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Good one, Patrick! [both laugh]
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick. [doorbell rings]
Patrick: Was he talking to me or you? [SpongeBob opens door to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you made it!
Squidward: My cable's out.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that. [SpongeBob hides some wire cutters behind his back]
Mr Krabs: So, uh, how's it going, Squidward?
Squidward: Not bad.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob clears his throat, attracting Mr. Krabs and Squidward's attention] I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47. [erases something on his clipboard and clicks his tongue] But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter. [SpongeBob takes Scooter and places him near Squidward] Here are some topic cards to break the ice. [hands them some cards. The doorbell rings] Oh, someone's at the door!
Scooter: Mine says, 'What came first?: the oyster or the pearl?' You take the side of the pearl!
Squidward: This is lame. [Squidward throws away his card and walks away]
Sadie: My card says, "Discuss the philosophical nature of irony." What does yours say?
Patrick: "Nod politely." [shown Mr. Krabs and Plankton with cards]
Mr. Krabs: What does yours say, Plankton?
Plankton: Oh, uh, it says, [really shows "Where are You From?"] 'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.' [clears throat] How interesting.
Mr. Krabs: Nice try, Plankton. [everyone is chattering amongst themselves. The doorbell rings]
SpongeBob: [he is looking angrily at his watch and tapping his foot and the doorbell rings] Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive... [looks at his watch] 22 minutes late! [opens up the door to Tom Smith]
Tom: Hey, hey! [SpongeBob folds his arms in a sort of anger. Tom laughs nervously holding a bag of chips as SpongeBob walks into the party]
SpongeBob: Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position! [silence. everyone claps silently] As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me! [laughs as he walks into a room with a sign that reads 'Coat Check', but ducks back out with a serious look] Seriously. [closes door]
Narrator: (television version only) That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages. [fades out and back in] [Patchy is shown dancing and a guy in a submarine outfit walks towards the camera] Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!
SpongeBob: [scene cuts to his wardrobe] Hey, Gare, got another coat for you. [throws the coat on Gary] The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to [uses air quotes] work. [cackles and walks back out with his clipboard] Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here? [guests are talking and dancing to the music. SpongeBob starts to hyperventilate] This is all wrong! What's happening to my party? [scene cuts to Sandy and Larry dancing] No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm! [scene cuts to Sandals eating cake. SpongeBob takes a vacuum and sucks out all the food from his mouth] Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52! [switches into 'blower.' Slice of cake is blown perfectly back into the rest of the cake. A plate with bacon and eggs is blown onto the table] Hey, what's this?
Sandals: That's my breakfast!
SpongeBob: Could I have everyone's attention please? [Patrick is dancing by the record player] Patrick! [stops the music] If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks. [the guests walk over to the couch] Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means! [gets out a newspaper] Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this! [guests cheer] This is yesterday's paper. [they stop cheering as SpongeBob walks outside] I'll just go grab today's paper. [everyone starts to party when he leaves. talking to himself] SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you? [tries to open the door] Locked out? [knocks on the door. Scene cuts to Patrick and Sandy are dancing]
Sandy: This song's got a great beat.
Patrick: Yeah. Knock, knock.
SpongeBob: Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me? [looks through the window and his eyes bug out as he wails. He sees the party, with all the guests dancing and having fun and the music blasting] Oh no! [cut to the topic cards on the floor and two fish just talking] They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing! [cut to Patrick eating all the deviled eggs in the piñata in one gulp and everyone else cheering him on] Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs! [scene cuts to two guests laughing] Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it. [scene cuts to Patrick and Mrs. Puff talking]
Patrick: So, do you come here often?
Mrs. Puff: No. [phone rings. Patrick answers]
Patrick: Hello, SquarePants residence. What? [covers one ear] I'm sorry, what? [scene cuts to SpongeBob using a pay phone outside, across the street]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!
Patrick: You wanna talk to SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!
Patrick: Okay, hold on. [opens door] SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!
SpongeBob: What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait! [SpongeBob runs toward the door.]
Patrick: Sorry, he's not out there. [Patrick closes it in front of him before he gets inside]
Scooter: Hey, dude, if you're looking for SpongeBob, he's over by the punch bowl.
Patrick: Thanks. [Patrick hands the phone to an ice sculpture of SpongeBob's head] Here you go, SpongeBob. [drops the phone in the punch]
SpongeBob: Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule! [looks up noticing the bathroom window is open. Scene cuts to Larry looking in the window]
Larry: Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat! [the mirror shows a real lobster on a plate] Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind. [looks through the medicine cabinet. He finds a comb with three angles and teeth coming out from them] Hey, check out his crazy comb.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet. [climbs up the side of his house] I hope they don't touch my special comb.
Larry: Well, I think I've aired it up enough. [Larry closes the window on SpongeBob's fingers. SpongeBob falls down screaming. Larry hears the screams] Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands flat on the ground then gets up and looks at his broken fingers] I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events! [scene cuts to inside where Pearl and Mrs Puff talking to each other]
Pearl: Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, yes, everything is quite lovely. [sees SpongeBob spying through the window] Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings. [turns the window around]
SpongeBob: I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in! [takes a shovel and digs. Digs up into the middle of the party] Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned. [guests are hopping around the room. They hop on SpongeBob and send him through the hole he dug] I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but... [now wearing a bunny suit] ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in! [takes a pick-ax to cut the door but a bright light shines at him]
Officer John: Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?
Officer O'Malley: I don't know. It's probably how he gets his kicks.
Officer John: You criminals make me sick.
SpongeBob: I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!
Officer John: [smiles] Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!
Officer O'Malley: You have a nice party now, sir. [both walk off]
SpongeBob: Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.
Officer John: Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?
SpongeBob: [stammer-like] But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.
Officer O'Malley: Whoa, whoa, okay, motor-mouth, tell it to the judge. [handcuffs SpongeBob but the handcuffs are not working] Oh no, these cuffs are broken.
Officer John: Huh, we can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.
[bubble transition to Officers John and O'Malley taking SpongeBob to jail in a pillory]
SpongeBob: Is it too late to offer you some punch?
Officer O'Malley: Sir, you have the right to remain silent. [scene cuts to next day]
SpongeBob: All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit! [tries to open the door] Oh, yeah, the door's locked. [lifts up the welcome mat] Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr! [inserts key and walks in] Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster. [Patrick walks up]
Patrick: That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!
SpongeBob: It was?
Patrick: Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!
SpongeBob: I am?
Patrick: Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya! [walks out]
SpongeBob: [smiles] SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all. [Gary's got a lampshade on his head] Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [turns off the light and Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Oh ho ho, I'm glad to see that old SpongeBob's party worked out. Now I gotta get me own party going! Ready for some real music, Potty?
Potty: [someone places corks in his ears] Bawk! Okay, ready.
Patchy: [starts singing and, while he singing, everybody is simply staring at him] ♪Oh... scurvy ain't for the likes of me, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho... Oh! Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho.. Oh, scurvy ain't for the likes of..♪
Potty: Bawk! It's time for your flute solo.
Patchy: Thank you, Potty, I almost forgot... [Potty gives him the flute and he is about to play it, but Patchy stops] Hey wait a minute. I don't play a flute. I play a fife. [Patchy turns and sees that the "flute" is actually a lit stick of dynamite; He screams in horror] Potty, no! [the dynamite explodes and everybody cheers] Wow, I can't believe I survived that one. [realizes his body is destroyed and he is reduced to only a head; he whimpers] Potty, help me!
Potty: Ladies and Gentlemen, bawk! The Bird Brains!
Bird Brains: ♪Come with me to the land I love, It's not right here, down the street, or up above. It's down below in the deep blue sea. Where SpongeBob lives, and the fun is always free. Down, down, down, to the bottom of the sea. Where our salty friend SpongeBob waits for you and me. [dolphin chirps] Down, down, down, ahh, we'll have lots of fun.

We'll catch some jellyfish if we get a chance, Say hello to Patrick, and do a little dance, Karate chop Sandy, see Squid get a tan, Eat a Krabby Patty and foil Plankton's plan. Down, down, down, to the bottom of the sea. We'll hook up with SpongeBob and his snail Gary. [Gary meows] Down, down, down, ahh, we'll have lots of fun You and me forever in the underwater sun, underwater sun.♪ [everybody cheers]
Patchy: [has a barrel on wheels for a new body and two wooden poles sticking out of it for arms] Aha! Great job, boys! Thanks for stopping by! Don't hit the porthole on the way out. [to the audience] And thank you for stopping by! You've made this party a real fun time. [The doorbell rings]
Potty: Bawk, the ladies are here!
Patchy: Oh! Ladies! Shiver me timbers! Welcome, girlies! [chuckles, but stops because the ladies are female birds and they giggle as they come in and attack him] Huh! No!
Potty: Goodbye, folks!
Patchy: It's Potty you're after!
Narrator: Thank you for coming to SpongeBob's House Party!
Patchy: Belay the smooching. Belay the smooching!


[SpongeBob is sitting inside of a box humming. He checks his watch. The mailman opens the mailbox, which turns out to be SpongeBob sitting inside his mailbox]
SpongeBob: Hi, mailman!
[The mailman yells in fear, and runs off]
SpongeBob: Okay, [gets out of the mailbox] see you tomorrow!
[Patrick walks up]
Patrick: Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?
SpongeBob: Let's see... [Looks through the mail] Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine!
[SpongeBob looks at the magazine]
SpongeBob: That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [They look inside the magazine] Whoa!
SpongeBob: Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!
[A picture of a rich person's swimming pool is shown]
SpongeBob: This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!
[A picture is shown of an old, rich person surrounded with bags of money]
Patrick: [Points at the man's feet] This guy's got shoes!
Squidward: Give me that! [Takes the magazine out of their hands] Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?
Squidward: They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.
SpongeBob: What kind of things?
Squidward: How should I know? Things people wanna buy. [walks off] Now keep your paws off my mail.
SpongeBob: That's it, Patrick! We gotta become entrepreneurs!
Patrick: Is that gonna hurt?
SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?
Patrick: Uh... [sweats] More time for thinking.
SpongeBob: No, something real, an item, something you would pay for.
Patrick: [pops up behind him] A chocolate bar?
SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick exiting the Barg'N-Mart carrying many chocolate bars]
SpongeBob: Fancy living, here we come!
Patrick: Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead.
[SpongeBob runs up and knocks on the door, Tom the fish opens the door]
SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some [holds up chocolate bar] chocolate?
Tom: Chocolate? Did you say, Chocolate?!
Patrick: Yes, sir. With or without nuts?
Tom: Chocolate?! CHOCOLATE?! CHOCOLATE! CHOCOLATE!
[SpongeBob and Patrick slowly back away, and then run off. Tom chases them while madly screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob ringing the doorbell of another house] 
SpongeBob: Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step! [A Con man opens the door] Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate?
Con man: Chocolate bars, eh?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!
Con man: Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!
[Patrick is shown holding many chocolate bars in his pants]
Con man: No, no no no, wrong. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, most certainly, sir!
Con man: Well, [chuckles] no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these! [He holds up a bright-orange bag]
SpongeBob: Wow... what is it?
Con man: It's a candy bar bag, you knucklehead! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!
[SpongeBob tries to touch it]
Con man: [pulls bag away] But, I'm wasting my time. [Walks inside] You don't need these bags.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We need 'em! We need 'em!
[The Con man grins, the scene changes to the Con man counting money. SpongeBob and Patrick are walking away with armfuls of bags]
Con man: So long, boys! Happy hunting! [Laughs when the two aren't looking] Suckers... [walks back inside]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing as they run off] Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!
SpongeBob: Let's try next door!
[SpongeBob walks up and rings the doorbell with his foot, the same Con man comes out]
Con man: Yes?
SpongeBob: Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?
Con man: I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags. [Holds up two large maroon bags]
Patrick: We'll take twenty!
[Scene changes to SpongeBob knocking on the door of a different house, Sadie comes out]
Sadie: Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?
SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?
Sadie: That sounds heavenly! I'll take one.
SpongeBob: One chocolate bar, coming up!
[SpongeBob attempts to pull out a chocolate bar, but keeps pulling more bags, while Patrick is zipping and unzipping his pants]
Sadie: [Sadie looks at her watch] I don't have time for this.
[Sadie goes back inside, and then SpongeBob pulls out a chocolate bar]
SpongeBob: I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice— [Sees something off camera; it is revealed to be Tom, still screaming]
Tom: Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate!
SpongeBob: —lady. [Tom chases SpongeBob and Patrick again while screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting in a diner] We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic.
Patrick: Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!
SpongeBob: No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?
Patrick: He said we were mediocre...
SpongeBob: That's it! He made us feel special!
Patrick: Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!
[Patrick runs to the door]
SpongeBob: No, wait, Patrick!
[Patrick freezes in place]
SpongeBob: Why don't we try being nice?
Patrick: Oh, okay.
[Scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking up to a customer's door]
SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good.
[Patrick knocks on the door, a customer opens the door]
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Hello?
Patrick: I love you.
[A harp is heard playing, the customer stares at SpongeBob and Patrick for a few seconds, then he slams his door shut in extreme disgust, a tuba is heard playing after the slamming]
SpongeBob: I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try.
[SpongeBob rings the doorbell, the customer opens the door]
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Please. G-Go away!
SpongeBob: Um, [clears throat] H-H-How you doin'?
Blue Fish with purple stripes: How am I doing?
SpongeBob: Wanna buy some chocolate?
Patrick: We got him now!
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, blubber boy?
[Patrick's belly is bubbling]
Patrick: Hee hee, it tickles!
Blue Fish with purple stripes: As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang.
[The customer holds up a picture of an obese self at age 13]
Blue Fish with purple stripes: You can keep that for five bucks.
Patrick: I'll take ten!
[Cut to SpongeBob with a sad look on his face walking, a sad song plays]
SpongeBob: We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that we're too easily distracted.
[Cut to Patrick staring at the pictures]
Patrick: Huh?
[Far cut]
SpongeBob: [raising his fist] Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.
Patrick: [Removing pictures from his face] Huh?
SpongeBob: [Holding out his hand] Let's shake on it.
Patrick: [Looking at SpongeBob confused] Did you say something?
[Cut to the other customer's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are seen entering the view]
SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, focus.
[Cut to the door, SpongeBob knocks on it, customer answers]
Purple Fish: Yes?
SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars.
[Patrick somehow moves up to the customer with his eyes going in and out back and forth]
Purple Fish: Why is Chubby here staring at me?
[Cut to Patrick's eyes]
Patrick: Focusing.
[Cut to the inside of the customer's house]
Purple Fish: [freaks out] Back up, Jack!
[The customer slams the door on Patrick's eyes, Patrick is heard saying "Oof!" from the other side of the door]
Patrick: [Moving eyes around] Nice place you got in here.
[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Patrick is eating a chocolate bar]
SpongeBob: I can't understand what were doing wrong.
Patrick: I can't understand anything.
SpongeBob: There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!
[Cut to the sign]
Patrick: [reading the sign] Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: They are most certainly not delicious!
Patrick: [smiling] Not the way I use them!
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Yet they sell millions of bags a day!
[Cut to Patrick]
Patrick: Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: [Happily] That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!
Tom: Chocolate!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run off, cut to Mary's house]
SpongeBob: We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!
Patrick: The kill!
[SpongeBob uses the doorbell, Mary answers]
Mary: Yes?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Hello, young lady.
[SpongeBob winks at Patrick, Patrick then chuckles]
SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate. [Getting a closer look at Mary] Is your mother home?
[Cut to Mary]
Mary: Mom!
Mary's Mother: [Entering from the right side of the house] What, what, what's all the yelling?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick who have stunned looks on their faces. Cut back to Mary's mother]
Mary's Mother: You just can't wait for me to die, can you?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Mary: They're selling chocolate.
Mary's Mother: Chocolate?
Mary: Yeah!
[Cut to Mary and her mom]
Mary's Mother: What, what are they selling?
Mary: Chocolates!
Mary's Mother: What?
Mary: Chocolates!
Mary's Mother: I can't hear you!
Mary: They're selling chocolates!
Mary's Mother: They're selling chocolate?
Mary: Yeah!
[Cut to a close-up of Mary's mother smiling]
Mary's Mother: Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.
[Cut back to view Mary and her mom]
Mary's Mother: I always hated it!
[Cut to SpongeBob sweating]
SpongeBob: Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...
[Patrick comes from the top left]
Patrick: You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.
[Cut to Mary and her mom, Mary is heard saying no constantly]
Mary's Mother: Live forever, you say? I'll take one. [Mary slaps her face. Cut to the outside, Mary pays SpongeBob a dollar]
Mary's Mother: [From inside house] Come on, you lazy Mary! [Cut to Mary] Start rubbing me with that chocolate!
Mary: [looking at SpongeBob and Patrick angrily] I hate you. [Slams door. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!
Patrick: [Raising fist] Hooray for lying!
[Bubbles transition to SpongeBob and Patrick, Patrick is seen with a look that was about to make him laugh]
SpongeBob: It'll make your hair grow.
[Cut to Fred]
Fred: Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, Patrick has a sad face this time]
SpongeBob: They'll make you sound smart.
[Cut to the customer holding money]
Customer: [southern accent] I'll take twenty!
[Cut to Patrick]
Patrick: It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.
[Cut to the two Patricks]
Patrick 2: Just in time.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick over and over]
SpongeBob: They'll make you fly!
Patrick: You'll fall in love!
SpongeBob: They'll bring world peace!
Patrick: You'll walk through walls!
SpongeBob: [echoing] You'll rule the world!
[Cut to a door, SpongeBob and Patrick are wrapped in casts. Cut close to Patrick]
Patrick: This'll be the best lie yet!
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!
[Customer opens door]
Customer: What can I do for you boys?
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.
Customer: Really?
[Cut to the customer, who apparently is in a cast covering his entire body]
Customer: Small world. What's the matter with you guys?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are completely stunned]
SpongeBob: [nervously] Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.
[Cut to the customer]
Customer: Ah, some guys have all the luck.
[A violin begins]
Customer: I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, they both have faces meaning that they were about to cry]
Customer: At night, [As SpongeBob looks up sadly, a tear runs down his face] I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.
[Cut to the customer, the wires snap]
Customer: [About to fall] Oh, no...
[A glass breaking sound is heard while the customer grunts while hitting the steps]
Customer: [On the last step] Ow...
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, let's help him!
[Cut to the inside of the house. SpongeBob and Patrick enter from the left]
SpongeBob: Careful, put him down gently.
[Patrick drops the customer's head, a glass breaking sound is heard, cut close to the customer]
Customer: [In pain] Ow...!
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?
[Cut to the customer]
Customer: Well, there is one thing... as you can well imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars. [gestures his head over to a massive stack of chocolate bar boxes. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Cut to the customer looking out his window as SpongeBob and Patrick walk by]
Customer: Such nice boys, [far cut to the customer] it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! Ha ha ha!
[Cut to a close-up of the customer laughing while looking at his cash, zipping his costume off to reveal himself as the Con Artist from earlier. Cut to the street]
SpongeBob: [grunting] Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.
[SpongeBob makes another grunting noise, he trips up on a rock and falls, cut to SpongeBob with a box flat on his face]
SpongeBob: Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.
Patrick: [Walking in from the left] I can live with that. [Places box on SpongeBob's box and sits on it, making a small squeaking sound]
SpongeBob: Let's change our names to Why and Bother.
[Tom appears behind the box]
Tom: Chocolate! [Screams and knocks SpongeBob, Patrick and the boxes over. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick babble]
SpongeBob: [simultaneously with Patrick] No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...
Patrick: [simultaneously with SpongeBob] No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!
[Cuts to Tom laughing manically]
Tom: Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you... [turns back to normal] I'd like to buy all your chocolate. [Holds up a large amount of cash. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick looking shocked, chocolate bars fall out of Patrick's shorts, along with a Hershey's kiss. Cut back to the three, SpongeBob and Patrick melt]
SpongeBob: Thank you for your patronage.
[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene, Patrick is pushing a wheelbarrow]
Patrick: Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?
[Cut to the money in the barrel, SpongeBob pops out]
SpongeBob: Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.
[Cut to the two]
Patrick: But what are we going to spend it on?
[Cut to SpongeBob thinking. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene, a boat in a bottle with "Fancy!" on top is seen. Cut to the inside of the boat]
Squidward: [Walking in from the left] Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.
Server: Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.
[Cut to Squidward shocked]
Squidward: But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?
Server: Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs [leaning over to Squidward] and their dates.
[Cut to SpongeBob, Patrick, Mary, and Mary's mother, Mary is seen holding a glass]
SpongeBob: So, how long have you two ladies known each other?
[Pause]
Mary's Mother: What? What did he say?



Narrator: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [we see a long line to the Krusty Krab] In a familiar restaurant, in a familiar part of town, a call goes out in frustration.
Frank: Will you hurry up?
Narrator: A call that would normally be answered by Bikini Bottom's semi-retired champions. If they weren't the ones causing the problem.
Mermaid Man: Let's see... I want a... no. [Shows a brief shot of Krusty Krab Menu] I want a... [camera returns to Mermaid Man] uh, no, uh, hmmm...
Squidward: Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!
SpongeBob: [whispering in Mermaid Man's ear] Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.
Mermaid Man: I've made my decision!
Line of Customers: Hooray!
Mermaid Man: One Krabby Patty for me and a Pipsqueak Patty for the boy.
Barnacle Boy: Now, wait just a darn minute!
Line of Customers: Awww!
Barnacle Boy: I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty! I want an adult size Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.
Barnacle Boy: Don't you see what you're doing? You're treating me like a child!
Mr. Krabs: The boy’s eyes are bigger than his stomach. [laughs]
Barnacle Boy: And that's another thing, I'm not a boy! I'm so old I got hairs growing out of the wrinkles in my liver spots. [shows a hair popping out]
Squidward: [snickering] One Pipsqueak patty [close up of the patty] and your bib and highchair.
Barnacle Boy: I'm 68 years old and I want a Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: Your Pipsqueak is getting cold. Shall I feed you?
Barnacle Boy: Feed this, old man! [slaps the Krabby Patty out of Mermaid Man's hand]
All except MM and BB:  Ooooooooh.
Barnacle Boy: I'm tired of playing second banana to a man who wears a bra! From now on, I want to be called Barnacle Man! And, I'm through protecting citizens that don't respect me!
SpongeBob: I respect you, Barnacle Man!

Barnacle Man: That's Barnacle Boy, I mean, Man! I... Ohh... forget you people. I say if you're not going to give me the respect I want as a hero, then maybe you'll give me respect as a villain. A villain who is... evil!

SpongeBob: Evil?
Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy &amp; Patrick: Evil? [Mermaid Man does nothing but smile, so Mr. Krabs slaps him]
Mermaid Man: Evil!
Barnacle Man: I'm crossing over... to the dark side! [points to dark side of Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Why should I waste money lighting the whole store? [villain car comes in, shows brief shot of License Plate (MEAN 2 U), then the window opens revealing Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble in the car]
Dirty Bubble: Did someone say evil?
SpongeBob: Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble! [BB gets in villain car]
Barnacle Man: Nighty night, you old goat!
Mermaid Man: Nighty-night! [to Squidward] Will you tuck me in?
Realistic Fish Head: We interrupt your bleak and meaningless lives for this news report. [Man Ray zaps a building] Man Ray, [Dirty Bubble grabs a local bank while snickering] the Dirty Bubble, and now, playing for the dark side, Barnacle Boy...
Barnacle Man: Barnacle Man!
Realistic Fish Head: ...have been committing a series of crimes throughout Bikini Bottom. [shows Man Ray, the Dirty Bubble, and Barnacle Man ding-dong-ditching]
Barnacle Man: Shh! [rings the doorbell and run off, while laughing]
Senior Citizen: [opens door] I'll get you crazy kids!
Realistic Fish Head: These three have named their new alliance: Every Villain Is Lemons, otherwise known as E.V.I.L.! What can we do? When will this crime wave end? How will we defeat the evil? Why am I asking you all these questions? Mermaid Man, where are you? [Mermaid Man does nothing but smile again, so Mr. Krabs slaps him again]
Mermaid Man: Huh? I'm right here! Don't worry, good citizens! Nothing will stop me from defeating the E.V.I.L.! [runs outside] Nothing! [ice cream truck sounds] Ice cream? I love ice cream! A double scoop of prune with bran sprinkles. [he receives an ice cream with a lit fuse] Mmm. [MM licks it and takes a big bite but explodes, "KA-BRAN!" appears, leaving a hole in his stomach] Goes right through me every time.
Barnacle Man: [E.V.I.L. is shown as ice cream men] You might as well give up, Mermaid Man, because there are three of us and only one of you. You don't stand a chance. [drives off]
SpongeBob: [runs to Mermaid Man with Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward] Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?
Mermaid Man: You're right. [sits down] I give up.
SpongeBob: You can't give up. What if we help you?
Mermaid Man: No, no, that's a terrible idea. But what if you help me?
SpongeBob: Okay!
Mermaid Man: Who wants to save the world?
SpongeBob: I do!
Sandy: I do!
Patrick: I do!
Squidward: I don't.

Mr. Krabs: [confronts Squidward] Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired! [runs back to the Krusty Krab; Squidward grumbles]

Mermaid Man: Then it's settled! To the Mermalair! [Transition to the Mermalair]
SpongeBob: Wow! The Mermalair!
Mermaid Man: These costumes belonged to the original International Justice League of Super Acquaintances!
SpongeBob: Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too.
Mermaid Man: Once you put on these costumes, their fantastic powers will become yours!
Sandy: Wow! I didn't think super powers worked that way.
Mermaid Man: Sure! Power's all in the costume! Why else would we run around in colored undies?
Squidward: I can think of three good reasons.
Narrator: [SpongeBob is running at lightning fast speed in his costume] The Quickster...with the uncanny ability to run really...quick!
SpongeBob: Want to see me run to that mountain and back? [doesn't move] You want to see me do it again?
Narrator: [Squidward is wearing his costume] Captain Magma...get him angry and he's bound to erupt!
Squidward: Krakatoa! [lava shoots out, licks his hand, then puts his thumb on his rear, while making a sizzling sound]
Narrator: The Elastic Waistband...able to stretch his body into fantastic shapes and forms! [Patrick, in his costume, stretches his whole body really long]
Patrick: I can finally touch my toes! [stretches his toes over the back of his body and to his hands]
Narrator: And Miss Appear...now you see her... [Sandy disappears in her costume] ...now you don't.
Sandy: Does this outfit make me look fat?
Narrator: The International Justice League of Super Acquaintances! A subsidiary of Viacom.
Mermaid Man: So, it's agreed. We'll get one cheese pizza, one with pepperoni and mushrooms, and one with olives.
Chief: Super Acquaintances, we need your help.
SpongeBob: Holy halibut! It's the chief!
Chief: Thank you for the introduction, Quickster, but we all know who I am! More importantly, we've found information on the whereabouts of E.V.I.L.
Patrick: The whose-abouts of what?
Sandy: You just tell us where they are, Chief, and we'll hog-tie 'em faster than you can say "Salsa Verde."
Chief: Our sources last found E.V.I.L. harassing teenagers up at "Make-Out Reef." You know, Make-Out Reef? [makes out with himself] Whoo hoo hoo!
SpongeBob: Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!
Mermaid Man: Those fiends! Attacking hormonally stressed-out children!
Squidward: Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times.
Mermaid Man: To Make-Out Reef, [chair falls backwards] away!
Patrick: Does this mean we're not getting pizza? [scene cuts to Make-Out Reef at night]
John &amp; Nancy: Stop, please!
E.V.I.L.: John and Nancy, sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!
Dirty Bubble: Oh! [points at a car] Shine the flashlight in that car, Man Ray!
Man Ray: Haha, with pleasure! [shines on a guy making out with a pillow]
Sandals: Hey man, that's not cool. [E.V.I.L. snickers until Mermaid Man appears]
Mermaid Man: Leave those young lovers alone!
Man Ray: Well, if it isn't Milk Maid Man! You've saved us the trouble of tracking you down!
Mermaid Man: You fiends can't win! You're outnumbered!
Man Ray: You senile bag of fish paste! There are three of us and only one of you!
SpongeBob: [runs up at super fast speed from behind and stops next to Mermaid Man] Make that two!
Man Ray: The Quickster!
Squidward: [blasts up and flies like a rocket over the villains and joins the two heroes] Three!
Barnacle Man: Captain Magma!
Patrick: [stretches far from behind and joins the three heroes] Four!
Dirty Bubble: The Elastic Waistband!
Sandy: [appears next to the group of heroes] Five!
E.V.I.L.: M-M-Miss Appear!
Mermaid Man: And me makes ten, I think.
Man Ray: Uh-oh.
Dirty Bubble: I don't have a good feeling about this.
Barnacle Man: Oh, there goes our toy deal.
Mermaid Man: Super Acquaintances, attack!
Barnacle Man: Oh no, please, mercy!
Squidward: Krakatoa! [lava shoots out onto The Quickster]
SpongeBob: Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off! [starts running in a circle fast] Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!
Patrick: I'll save you, Quickster! [stretches his arms to try and save Quickster, but ends up getting caught, and flies out with his arms overstretched. The villains look at each other in confusion]
Mermaid Man: I'll cool you off, Quickster, with one of my water balls! [creates a water ball with his hands and concentrates, but targets Captain Magma instead] Aha!
Squidward: Huh?! No, no, no, I'm not the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag... [gets hit by the water ball] ma... [coughs, then melts to pile of ash]
Sandy: Well, I guess it's up to me! [turns invisible and only her footprints show in the ground] I'll sneak over...unseen...and catch them by surprise. [a boat hits her, sending her through the sign and to the cliff, while still invisible] Aaaaaah! [land on the ground]
SpongeBob: Get it off! Get it off! [eventually stops, but only shown as shoes] Whew...glad that's over!
[villains look at fallen heroes and Mermaid Man falls backwards]
Barnacle Man: We did it, we won! This day belongs to E.V.I.L.! [approaches the fallen Mermaid Man] You've lost Mermaid Man, and the superhero and super-villain rules say you have to give in to my demands.
Mermaid Man: Okay, what do you want?
Man Ray: World domination! Tell him we want world domination!
Dirty Bubble: And make him eat dirt! Hahaha! [Man Ray stares at him] In addition to the...domination thing.
Barnacle Man: Number one, I want to be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick. Number two, I want to be called Barnacle Man. And number three...
Man Ray: Come on, world domination!
Barnacle Man: I want an adult-sized Krabby Patty.
Dirty Bubble: [he and Man Ray are shocked] Did you hear him say anything about eating dirt?
Barnacle Man: Need a hand, superpal? [both start to get tears in their eyes as they grab and shake hands. "FRIEND!" appears]
Mermaid Man: Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle. Let's go get you that Krabby Patty! [leaves with Barnacle Boy]
Man Ray: Was that it? [groans in disgust] That's sickening!
Dirty Bubble: Oh, this reminds me of the time I went to Cancun with a killer shrimp. Oh, they had these papaya drinks that were to die for!
Man Ray: [while Dirty Bubble is talking] Oh, Neptune, shut up! [at the Krusty Krab. Barnacle Boy is eating an adult-sized Krabby Patty]
Mermaid Man: How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle [winks] Man?
Barnacle Man: Actually, it's pretty big. I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing. [Mermaid Man laughs, then Barnacle Boy laughs, SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward come in, all injured and laughing, the guy at make-out reef who was kissing the pillow is laughing, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble are in jail, laughing, and the chief is making out with himself, he turns around and laughs hysterically]


SpongeBob: [turns off the alarm] Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary. [Gary pushes a button that sends SpongeBob jumping out of his bed, into the air. SpongeBob bounces off a chair, while sipping his cup of tea] Ahh... [toast pop out into the air, where SpongeBob eats them. Gary spits SpongeBob's pants into the air where SpongeBob lands on a target that Gary has painted] Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though. [Gary gives him an angry look. SpongeBob heads to the door] See you later. [opens the door where Patrick is standing there with a net in his hand]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today.
Patrick: Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?
SpongeBob: I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?
Patrick: [starting to sob] Wait for you to get back.
SpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?
Patrick: Hey, that's a great idea!
SpongeBob: You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it! [Patrick imagines a Kindergarten Class photo of him and SpongeBob smiling goofy with each other]
Patrick: Wow. [scene cuts to them at school]
SpongeBob: Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime. [shows Patrick Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
Patrick: [laughs] And no line.
SpongeBob: Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning. [runs up to the water fountain] And this is the Fountain Of Learning. [runs to the lockers] And these are the Lockers Of Learning.
Patrick: [runs up to some stairs] And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?
SpongeBob: No, they're just the stairs. [walks over to another set of stairs] These are the Stairs Of Learning.
Patrick: Where is everyone?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'til 9.
Patrick: [He suddenly, hilariously wears a watch, and looks at it] 6:20? But I thought you said you were late.
SpongeBob: Late for being early!
Patrick: Hey... [looks at his watch] When did I start wearing a watch?
SpongeBob: [both walk into the classroom] And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.
Patrick: Ohh.
SpongeBob: [walks up to the chalkboard] And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.
Patrick: Ohhh.
SpongeBob: [walks up to the Good Noodle Board] And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.[looks at Patrick]
Patrick: Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!
SpongeBob: [points to each star] Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too. [adds Patrick's name] There you are.
Patrick: But look at all the stars you have. I'll never be that good.
SpongeBob: Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem! [high pitched] 74.
Patrick: Who said that? [runs over to an egg in a box] Was it him?
SpongeBob: I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.
Patrick: What does he teach us?
SpongeBob: The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat. [points the light bulb] This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes... Roger would die.
Patrick: [turns light on and off] LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: [turns light on] Sorry... [SpongeBob moves his desk to the front of the teacher's desk]
SpongeBob: The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?
Patrick: [jumps into the chair] I'm learning!
SpongeBob: This is gonna be great! [both giggle. Scene cuts to class]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?
Patrick: [confused] Who's the fat kid talking to?
SpongeBob: You, Patrick, she's the teacher.
Patrick: Oh.
Mrs. Puff: Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous. [Patrick gets up and looks at class]
Patrick: Uhh...guhhhh...
Mrs. Puff: We just want to know your name. [Patrick gets more nervous]
Patrick: Gyuhhh...uhhh...guhhhh...24. [class laughs hysterically]
Class: HAHAHAHAHAHA!
Mrs. Puff: [sarcastically] Oh, great, another genius...
Patrick: [sits back down] Why are they laughing?
SpongeBob: I guess it's just in the timing.
Patrick: Oh. [Patrick laughs after a brief pause]
Mrs. Puff: [writes on the chalkboard] Today's first lesson will be on turning.
Patrick: 24. [both start to giggle, and Mrs. Puff pauses and continues writing]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I thought of something funnier than 24.
Patrick: Let me hear it.
SpongeBob: [stifled laugh] ...25. [both try and fail to hold in their laughter. Patrick goes red in the face while SpongeBob bangs his fist on his desk]
Mrs. Puff: [overhears] That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Now then, "Turning"; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least... [Patrick places a paper on SpongeBob's desk]
SpongeBob: [looks at the drawing Patrick gave him of Mrs. Puff and gasps] Big Fat Meanie!?! Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!
Mrs. Puff: What about the teacher? [SpongeBob screams then shivers and bites his lip in fear as Mrs. Puff sees Patrick's drawing of her. She now appears the same shape as Patrick's drawing to demonstrate the "ugly" drawing.] AS IF I REALLY LOOK LIKE THIS! [puts it a drawer with a bunch of other bad drawings of her. Mrs. Puff returns back to her original shape and blames SpongeBob.] SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions. [Takes out a scraper. Scraper shines.]
SpongeBob: No...
Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle. [walks over to the Good Noodle Board]
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!!
Mrs. Puff: [about to remove the star] You'll get this star back when you earn it.
SpongeBob: [wailing] NOOOO! [As Mrs. Puff positions the scraper under the star and begins to peel it off, SpongeBob goes berserk, bouncing up and down in his seat and banging his head on his desk, constantly panting as he bangs his head. SpongeBob's head spins around on his body as Mrs. Puff slowly removes the star.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  [When the glue holding the star to the board stretches to the point of it snapping off the board, SpongeBob's eyes roll to the back of his head and he faints, sliding out of his seat onto the floor.]
Patrick: [raises his hand] Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room!
SpongeBob: What, me? But why?
Mrs. Puff: Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!
SpongeBob: [Mad] Thanks a lot, Patrick.
Patrick: Sure thing, buddy. [SpongeBob walks to the back. His classmates are staring at him]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here. [Mrs. Puff's voice is receding as SpongeBob tries to listen from the back] It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway? [reads the writing on the desk] 'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?
Patrick: Psst, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [to himself] Just ignore him, SpongeBob.
Patrick: SpongeBob, over here.
SpongeBob: Whatever you do, don't look at him.
Patrick: Psst, SpongeBob. [grunts as he throws a piece of wadded-up paper at SpongeBob] Psst, SpongeBob. [throws a book at SpongeBob] SpongeBo-ob! [spits a bunch of spitballs on SpongeBob's face] SpongeBob? Psst, over heeeere... I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.
SpongeBob: [whispers loudly] What?!?!
Patrick: [meekly] Hi.
SpongeBob: [yells, removing all the spitballs] HIIIIIIIIIIIIII?!?!?! [he growls, then stops when he sees Mrs. Puff angry, covered in spitballs]
Mrs. Puff: Perhaps this would be a good time for recess. [scene cuts to SpongeBob at his locker. Patrick walks up to him]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff.
SpongeBob: [angrily slams his locker] There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!
Patrick: [becomes angry] Who cares about a stupid star?
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, CONSIDERING YOU ARE ONE!
Patrick: I'll deal with you after class!
SpongeBob: It is after class! [a group of students crowd around SpongeBob and Patrick chanting 'fight']
Patrick: I don't see anyone fighting, do you?
SpongeBob: They're talking about us! We're fighting!
Patrick: Well, don't mind if I do! [both start to punch. The group of students start to quiet down as they notice SpongeBob and Patrick are punching, but missing at the same time]
Student: This is embarrassing. [everyone leaves as Mrs. Puff walks up]
Mrs. Puff: [lifts SpongeBob and Patrick] What's going on here?! [looks at Patrick] Well?
Patrick: SpongeBob and I were fighting.
Mrs. Puff: [gasps] Fighting? [puts them down] Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend [lights dim on Mrs. Puff and scary music plays] to detention!
SpongeBob: Detention!?
Mrs. Puff: May Neptune have mercy on your soul. [Mrs. Puff turns off the flashlight she was holding. Scene cuts to classroom where SpongeBob is sitting at the front and Patrick is sitting at the back]
SpongeBob: [sulking] In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg. [angrily] It's all Stupid Patrick's fault. [turns to look at Patrick] I hate you, Patrick.
Patrick: I hate you more.
SpongeBob: I'd hate you no matter what.
Patrick: Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.
SpongeBob: [stares at Patrick for a few seconds, then narrows his eyes] I'd hate you even if that made sense.
Patrick: I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.
SpongeBob: I'd hate you, even if, uhh... [tries to think of something else to say] Um, I'd hate you... [points to Roger's tank] even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out. [The camera quickly pans over to where SpongeBob is pointing. Suddenly, the light bulb flickers, and then burns out completely, with smoke rising out of the light bulb] Huh?
[SpongeBob bites his lip and starts shivering. He glances over at Patrick. Patrick is sitting at his desk about to cry.]
Patrick: Ohh... [He starts to turn to look at SpongeBob, but when he sees him, he quickly looks away from him, crossing his arms.] Hmph.
[SpongeBob watches Patrick, surprised, then does the same. But then he sees Roger's egg shivering in his tank and really starts to panic. We then see that it's snowing in Roger's tank. Snow is piled up around Roger, who is shivering under a pile of snow. Sleigh bells jingle in the background.]
Patrick: [teary-eyed again] Ohhhhh...! [cut back to Roger, who is frozen inside a giant ice cube, with wind blowing]
[SpongeBob and Patrick begin to quietly sob. The camera closes-up on SpongeBob, then Patrick. Finally, unable to take it anymore, SpongeBob turns around in his desk.]
SpongeBob: Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!
Patrick: [talking fast] I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs--
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, your apology is so long!
Patrick: Me too! Let's save Roger! [they run to Roger]
SpongeBob: [takes Roger] I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet!
Patrick: [opens the door to the supply closet] Ahh! LIGHT BULB! [there is a pile of light bulbs, but Patrick is looking at the one that is already plugged in at the top] But why does it have to be so far away? [begins to climb the pile of bulbs. SpongeBob tries warming up the egg by sitting on it, huffing and puffing on it, etc. while Patrick is still climbing the pile of light bulbs, wearing fancy clothing. Patrick finally reaches the top, blows a horn, removes his clothes, then runs down the pile with the light bulb] I'm coming, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth. [runs into Patrick and both of their items are in the air] The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!
Patrick: Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm! [both jump for the item that is closest to them and crash into the floor with an item in their hands. They put the light bulb and egg back where they were]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!
Mrs. Puff: [off-screen] Good job boys! [Mrs. Puff turns on a light from behind the chalkboard] I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School.
Patrick: Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class. See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big, Fat Meanie. [leaves the classroom]
Roger: [egg hatches] Hey! What'd I miss?


Sandals: Uhh, what do you like better? The coral bits or the nacho oyster skins?
Squidward: I like neither. Can I take your order?
Sandals: What about the barnacle rings, are they any good?
Squidward: No. What will you have?
Sandals: Well, uhh, what's your vote on the kelp?
Squidward: [He finally loses his temper and he throws the paper and pencil in anger] Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?
SpongeBob: [Pokes his head out from behind the kitchen window] Psst, try the coral bits.
Sandals: Uhh, I'll try the coral bits.
Squidward: That'll be one dollar. [Rings up one dollar then a siren goes off]
Sandals: What's going on?
Squidward: Something stupid, I'm sure. [Alarm stops as a curtain opens up to show a real band in the background playing carnival music. Mr. Krabs comes out from the restroom, cheering]
Mr. Krabs: Yippee! [kisses Sandals and Squidward. Takes the dollar and laughs hysterically as he rubs it all over himself] Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!
Squidward: See? I told you.
SpongeBob: What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [Looks weird as he runs over to the counter] Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!
Squidward: A very dirty dollar?
Mr. Krabs: No, this is my one millionth dollar earned. Every Krab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine. Congratulations, sir, you have just given me my one millionth dollar!
Sandals: Ha, great. Uhh, what do I win?
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, now get out.
Sandals: Uhh, what?
Mr. Krabs: Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment! [Pushes everyone out the door] Me millionth dollar.
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Congratulate yourselves, lad. A captain's nothing without his loyal crew. I mean, a crew like you [He imagines SpongeBob and Squidward looking deformed] comes around maybe once in a lifetime! And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.
SpongeBob: Wow, a trip!
Squidward: I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. Where are we going? Fancy Springs?
[Scene cuts to the three of them in a pool]
Mr. Krabs: No...
Squidward: Pamper Island?
[Scene cuts to the three of them laying on towels at a beach]
Mr. Krabs: Try again...
Squidward: Oh! Oh! Oh! Bikini Bottom Folk Village?
[Scene cuts to the three of them in 18th century clothing]
Mr. Krabs: Better than that!
[Scene cuts to them wearing raincoats on a boat accompanied by a foghorn noise]
Squidward: ...clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work? [Clams are jumping] Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?
Mr. Krabs: Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams [Catches a clam then he throws it back] then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?
Squidward: No. [Takes off his raincoat and sits on his chair] And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?
Squidward: How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?
SpongeBob: Okay! [SpongeBob casts his line behind him which catches on Squidward's magazine. SpongeBob brings his line forward and casts it in the lagoon. SpongeBob casts Squidward's chair]
Squidward: Hey, watch where you're swinging that! [SpongeBob casts Squidward's shirt out in the lagoon] SpongeBob, be careful with tha- [SpongeBob casts Squidward's nose into the lagoon] [loudly in pain] AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! [Squidward walks up to Mr. Krabs] Okay, I've had enough...
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up. [SpongeBob is still casting out items while Mr. Krabs talks to Squidward] Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose. [Laughs. The hook in SpongeBob's fishing rod touches Mr. Krabs millionth dollar. Gasps] Me millionth dollar! [SpongeBob rips Mr. Krabs' pants off and casts his dollar to the lagoon] SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya. [Music plays] Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in! Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster! [SpongeBob reels it in as fast as he can. Mr. Krabs opens the doors to the orchestra] There you are, you stinking bilge rats. Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it! Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Here she comes... [Mr. Krabs begs; SpongeBob reels the dollar in] ...she made it!
Mr. Krabs: [Holds up the dollar and cheers] For a second or two, I thought she was a goner! [Ominous orchestra music plays again. Suddenly, a giant clam jumps up and takes Mr. Krabs' dollar. It takes a while for Mr. Krabs to notice his dollar isn't in his claw anymore. The clam swims away. The scene cuts as Mr. Krabs’ eyes well up with tears, and he begins to cry]
Squidward: So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, you're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar! [sobbing and flops to the ground] I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back. [Whips his eyes against the floor] Never, never, never, never, never!
SpongeBob: I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up. [Mr. Krabs is literally in pieces, crying]
Squidward: Oh, please, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act. [Mr. Krabs is crying while sucking his feet] Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar. [Mr. Krabs continues weeping as he pours tears into his mouth] For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up! [Mr. Krabs' eyes inflate then squirt out tears] Mr. Krabs... [Mr. Krabs is wailing like a fountain] Mr. Krabs... [Mr. Krabs is sobbing like a faucet. Squidward has had enough.] Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!
Mr. Krabs: [Sucks on a thumb then he throws it away] You will? Great! Wait right here. [Runs off to get some items and comes back with a bunch of fishing gear on] Here's where clam fishing gets serious. [Scene cuts to later in the day where Mr. Krabs is on top of the boat and SpongeBob and Squidward are on the lower deck] Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip.
SpongeBob: [Salutes] Aye aye, captain!
Mr. Krabs: And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar. [Mr. Krabs scouts the area. Scene cuts to later where Mr. Krabs has a beard on from scouting for too long. Squidward and SpongeBob look the same as Mr. Krabs]
Squidward: [Ripping off his beard] That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!
SpongeBob: Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary. [Scene cuts to Gary chewing up SpongeBob's couch at home]
Squidward: We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar. [Takes a dollar out of his wallet] Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?
SpongeBob: Oh, I get ya. [Jabbers. Scene cuts to later in the day where Mr. Krabs is still scouting the area]
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs steers his eyes toward the other two to see them waving a dollar] Look what we've got!
Mr. Krabs: [Jumps down and gasps] Could it be? [Takes the dollar] Me millionth dollar? [Starts cheering again as well as SpongeBob and Squidward] Whoo-hoo! [Rubs the dollar on himself but he notices something strange so he stops dancing] Wait a minute... [Rubs the dollar back and forth again and points at the dollar] This isn't me millionth dollar. [SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other] This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, [Shows dollar bill just like described] and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.
SpongeBob: [wearing blue lipstick] Actually, it's Coral Blue number t- [Squidward whacks him on the head with a fishing rod to shut him up, but it's already too late]
Mr. Krabs: I trusted you, and you gave me this?! I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this. [sobs]
Squidward: No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.
Mr. Krabs: [stops sobbing, then narrows his eyes] I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.
Squidward: You're kidding?
SpongeBob: Woo! Is it another fishing trip?
Mr. Krabs: No. It's this sandwich. [Nails the sandwich to a pole]
Squidward: A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?
Mr. Krabs: Not a sandwich. [throws the other sandwiches into the lagoon] The sandwich.
Squidward: Whatever, we've got plenty more to- [He and SpongeBob get shocked. Mr. Krabs throws the refrigerator into the lagoon] ...eat.
Mr. Krabs: Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back!
Squidward: Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!?
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Squidward: Just look at him! [Pointing to Mr. Krabs, who is dressed like he is at a funeral sobbing at a tombstone with the words 'R.I.P. Me Millionth Dollar' on it. He then hugs it.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you- [cuts off after Mr. Krabs laugh oddly]
Squidward: Look again. [Mr. Krabs uses his eyes as a jump rope while giggling like a crazy person]
SpongeBob: [now visibly scared] You're right. How do we get outta here?
Squidward: If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.
SpongeBob: Okay. [Both take a step, then start screaming as they sprint over to the lifeboat. They jump into it but then come back onto the boat tied up; Mr. Krabs pops his head out of the lifeboat]
Mr. Krabs: [Angry] So you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. "It's just a dumb old dollar! Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice!" [sobs] Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you. [Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs hanging his line over the boat. SpongeBob and Squidward are attached to the line] Live bait.
Squidward: You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?
Mr. Krabs: [Dressed up as a conductor] Oh, he'll come. [Taps the book using his baton and the doors open up to the orchestra and begins to play the ominous music; SpongeBob and Squidward shake and scream in terror]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say... [Yells] YOU ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR MIND!!! [Mr. Krabs giggles madly while conducting the orchestra. The giant clam emerges above the lagoon coming closer to the two on the line] Get us out of here!
Mr. Krabs: Come on, fresh meat! [SpongeBob and Squidward scream as they try to wiggle back and forth to avoid the giant clam] Keep thrashing! He likes it! [Both continue to scream and bounce up and down really fast] Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there. [Giant clam shows the dollar on its tongue] That's it! [Closes the doors to cause the music to stop. The giant clam stops in mid-air and Mr. Krabs jumps inside it to take the dollar] Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it! [Rubs his dollar on himself] I finally got me millionth dollar...! [Cabin doors open to play the ominous music again. The giant clam closes its mouth, with Mr. Krabs inside, and dives into the lagoon. Cabin doors close after the conductor takes a bow]
SpongeBob: Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives. [A tear falls down his cheek] Why couldn't it have been me?!
Squidward: Yes, why couldn't it have been you?! [Sobbing]
SpongeBob: Why did he have to go like this, why?! [Crying]
Squidward: Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?! [Both sob]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, boys! [SpongeBob and Squidward stop sobbing]
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs' head is above the lagoon]
Mr. Krabs: Have you boys met... [Holds his millionth dollar up] ...me millionth dollar? [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wow, how did you get it back?
Mr. Krabs: It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter, so eventually, we settled on a trade.
SpongeBob: What did you give him? [Mr. Krabs jumps back up on the boat, revealing himself as only having a head and left arm]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing important. [Laughs. SpongeBob and Squidward look shocked.]


[first lines, as we pan across live-action houses of 692-145]
Narrator: It's time for another SpongeBob SquarePants special! But it's not an ordinary special, [we cut to outside Patchy's house] because today we go to Encino, California, as it was… [lightning flashes and the houses are replaced by caves. It's smoggy, there are loads of plants and trees, and a volcano in the distance] …one hundred million years ago! So prepare yourself for… [cut to a screen reading "SpongeBob B.C."] SpongeBob SquarePants B.C.! [stone text drops reading: 'Before Comedy'. cut to a still frame of Patchy and Potty] With your host, Patchy the Pirate! [audience cheers and applauds. Zoom inside the stone house. Inside are all the creature comforts of a normal home, but de-modernized. Patchy, in leopard garb, comes in riding a paper-mache dinosaur]
Patchy: Yee-ha! Hey kids! Now, you're probably wondering, "Hmm, what's Patchy doing in a cave?" good question, you little... [grumbles to self. The dinosaur walks over to a wall where there a cave drawings of Sponge and jellyfish] Well, it's because today's SpongeBob takes place in prehistoric times [cut to the drawing of Sponge with a stick and jellyfish] ...back when man struggled for survival [pan over to show a dinosaur eating Pat and Sponge running away] and dinosaurs ruled the Earth. [the dinosaur walks back into the middle of the room] Isn't that right, Bronty? But I'm riding YOU now! [pan out to reveal Patchy is wearing the dinosaur like an inner tube, and he struggles to get out of it, but falls over on his side. He screams for aide and two stagehands run over to him. Cut to a "Please Stand By" screen. Soon, Patchy is up] Like I was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest. [cut to black-and-white footage of cavemen] It was a simpler time [cut to a picture of a caveman with a finger up his nose] with simpler pleasures! [cut to Patchy, holding up two robes, identical to each other and the one Patchy is wearing] Your clothes always match! [cut to Patchy with a paintbrush] You can draw on the walls! And nobody yell at ya! [he picks up a giant club] It was much easier to hit a baseball! [he sits down on the couch] Oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best. [he gasps] Hey kids! Are those pterodactyl wings I hear 'a flappin'? I think I know who that is! Please welcome the Potty-dactyl! [Potty flies in, but has a head visor and jetpack on]
Potty: [squawk] Sorry I'm late.
Patchy: Potty! Why aren't you wearing your costume? [he picks up the pterodactyl costume] I stayed up all night making it!
Potty: [squawk] You're wasting your time, old man. Prehistoric stuff is lame. Everybody knows the future's where it's at.
Patchy: What?! [laughs nervously] That's not true! Don't mind him, folks. Why even SpongeBob SquarePants knows that prehistoric stuff is, what the kids say, [air quotes] cool.
Potty: [squawk] No he doesn't.
Patchy:  Yes he does.
Potty: Nope.
Patchy: He most certainly does.
Potty: No he doesn't.
Patchy: Yes he does!
Potty: No.
Patchy: [angry] I know for a fact that he does!
Potty: ...not. [Patchy fumes. Cut to a screen reading...]
Narrator: Meanwhile. [cut to SpongeBob at the grill, all nervous. Krabs busts in]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What's wrong?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Mr. Krabs, but I've got this strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me. [close-up on Sponge] And the parrot is winning. [cut to Patchy and Potty]
Patchy: Does.
Potty: Doesn't.
Patchy: Does.
Potty: Doesn't.
Patchy: Does.
Potty: Doesn't.
Patchy: Does! Uh, look, while we're arguing, why don't you folks go ahead and watch some prehistoric SpongeBob! Roll the cartoon! …does.
Potty: Doesn't. [Patchy fumes. the opening title screens, which before were blue and luscious with plants and shells, are now gray with fossils. Episode starts. We see the Bikini Atoll Island as we often do at the beginnings of episodes. But this time, it is a prehistoric island with murky water and foggy skies. A pterodactyl flies over the island]
Narrator: Ah, dawn breaks over the primordial sea. [We submerge into the prehistoric Pacific ocean to see a muddy swamp] It's here that millions of years ago, life began taking its first clumsy steps out of the darkness, opening its newly- formed eyeballs to stare into the blinding light of intelligence, in order to- Umm... never mind. This happened a long time ago.
[We pan over to prehistoric Conch street, where three houses similar to SpongeBob's pineapple, Patrick's rock, and Squidward's Easter Island Head, except SpongeBob's house has a fern growing out of the top, Squidward's is more like a monkey-shaped head, and Patrick's has no bamboo weathervane. These are prehistoric homes to the three's cavemen ancestors. In caveman SpongeBob's house, it is one large, empty room with cave drawings of him jellyfishing on the walls and rocks and bones on a shelf above his blanket, which he sleeps under. Back outside, a giant purple dinosaur fish wakes up under a beam of sunlight to gurgle out a call similar to SpongeBob's foghorn alarm clock. The sound waves cause the rock to rattle off a shelf and it falls on the prehistoric sponge's head. Alarmed, Sponge shrieks, but calms down when he notices the rock. He laughs and shoves the rock back on the shelf. He then takes his hide blanket from on the floor and puts it on as a pair of caveman pants. He puts one arm through a sleeve and walks outside of his pineapple, dragging a vine behind him]
SpongeGar: Banooga ready! Tabonga, Gary.
Prehistoric Gary: Meow.
SpongeGar: Gary! Tabonga!
[SpongeGar walks into the clearing with the vine, and we that it's a leash and he's walking a dinosnail Gary]
Gary: Meow.
[Leaves behind a long trail of slime. SpongeGar and Gary walk past the primitive tiki lair that holds prehistoric Squidward, who looks out the window to see a path of blue slime on his path]
Squog: Huh? Grrr...
[He is about to walk outside, but stops]
Squog: Wait a minute...
[He imagines himself babbling in anger at Gary, and Gary smashing him into a splattered squid with an eyestalk]
Squog: Hmm...
[He runs over and picks up two clubs. He debates with himself over which one to use. He takes the bigger one and walks out chuckling. The club left behind cries. Squog approaches SpongeGar and Gary, who are out in the clearing]
Squog: SpongeGar! SpongeGar! Manaka! No tabonga Gary pooga! [Dino Gary rolls his eyes and slithers away as Squogg displays a small pile of snail slime and points to his front walkway, covered in the snail goop] Tabonga as a go o saila! Tabonga doo. Tabonga doo!
SpongeGar: Tabonga doo? Hmm... Tabonga doo...
[Squog fumes and stamps off, but slips on the snail slime, sliding as if on a "Slip 'n' Slide", screaming for SpongeGar's help. But SpongeGar is too busy pondering the meaning of Squog's demand. Squog slams into caveman Patrick's rock, which opens, revealing Patrick's ancestor sticking to the underside of it as Patrick often does]
Patar: Patar!
[He walks over to Squog, who is covered in snail slime, but not sliding any longer]
Patar: Hmm... Yuk! [He sniffs his slime coating] Blecch! [He tastes some of the slime cautiously] Blecch! [He then takes out a salt shaker and adds some salt to the slime and tastes it again. This time it appears to be somewhat palatable, and he is satisfied, giving two thumbs up] Mowonga!
[Squog, gets angry and shakes the slime off himself]
Squog: Patar! Grrr...
Patar: Squog! [He laughs and hugs him] Patar unga Squog!
[He squeezes him so tightly, that the veins in his arms pop out, and Squog is slightly strangled]
Patar: Squog.
Squog: [ Gets strangled even harder ] Eeek!
Patar: Squog!
[SpongeGar notices Patar]
SpongeGar: Patar!
[Patar sees him and lets go of Squog, and Squog passes out onto the ground. The two run up to each other]
Patar: SpongeGar! [SpongeGar smiles and hits himself on the head. Patar smiles and punches himself in the face a couple times. SpongeGar pulls out his nose and lets it go, slamming it back into his face. He screams, then stops suddenly and smiles. Patar pulls his lower lip over his head, and it tears off. He screams, then smiles] SpongeGar!
SpongeGar: Patar.
Squog: Pfffffttt!
[Patar and SpongeGar hug]
Squog: SpongeGar and Patar no got malonka palinka. Heh, heh. Palinka... [He is about to walk home again, when he slips on the slime trail again, and slides for a moment longer before sliding into his clay monkey head house and crashing into the back wall, where cave paintings of hunters with arrows point at his exposed rear] Wima soe... [Back in the sand field across from the row of homes, SpongeGar reaches into his pants and pulls out half of a coconut shell with juice inside. He howls in glee. Patar sniffs it. SpongeGar gets a log and pours the liquid into it and blows into a hollow branch sticking out of the top of it, producing a bubble in a hole on the other side of the log. Patar tries to take cover from the bubble, but then sees it pop and realizes it's harmless and that there is no need to protect himself from it. So he claps and howls in delight. Then, clouds appear and it begins to rain. Patar then claps again and the rain stops, and the clouds relocate themselves. Patar smiles. SpongeGar tries his hand at it, but the rain stall. A few moments later, the clouds re-appear and it rains. Both cheer. Patar claps, and the rain ceases once more. The two get excited, and clap excessively. The rain begins, but won't stop. Next, thunder sounds, and the two stop their howling. Patar claps again, but nothing happens. Squog watches them from the second story window in his house] Patar an SpongeGar bawannagog. No pooca Squog. Squog tay taila foo.
[Squog starts to paint when thunder sounds, and lightning strike. Squog looks out his window and gasps to see that the bubble-blowing log has been ignited in flames, and Patar and SpongeGar have been injured by the lightning]
Squog: Patar! SpongeGar!
[Both get up and run behind a rock, startled. They peek out from behind it to see the fire. SpongeGar, Squog, and Patar slowly approach it, quaking. Squog sniffs it and sticks his hand into it. His hand burns and he takes it out and screams in pain. SpongeGar and Patar put their hands in]
Both: Huh? Hmmm... Uh-huh, Uh-huh... Ahhh...
[Suddenly, both scream, and all three suck their hands. Then, Patrick sniffs his, and turns away from it. Then, he adds salt and gnaws on his hand, and crawls away, thinking that SpongeGar and Squog will eat it. They don't want it, but they do get hungry. SpongeGar sees two plants]
SpongeGar: Fongar!
[As he runs over to get them, Squog calls him a protozoa]
Squog: Monga.
[SpongeGar is walking back when he trips and the plants fly into the fire]
Squog: SpongeGar!
[He angrilly speaks gibberish. When he's done, he turns to see that Patar is salting his burnt hand. When Patar goes to bite Squog's hand, Squog smashes his head in with a stick]
Squog: Patar! Chonga!
[Patar crawls away disappointedly. SpongeGar stares at Squog's stick, the two plants in the fire, then the stick again, then the plants, back and forth. We hear mystical music as he looks at the two faster and faster. Then, we see the four live-action singers in barber-shop garb with gray mustaches. Suddenly, SpongeGar gets an idea]
SpongeGar: Aha! Squog! Squog! [Motions towards the stick] Tooka SpongeGar? Hmm? [Squog nods happily and hits SpongeGar on the head with the stick] Nah! Nah! Nah!
[He slowly impales one of the plants with the stick. He sniffs it and then eats it. He then begins jumping up and down in delight, hooting. Apparently, it tasted good. Squog watches him. Then, SpongeGar offers the other plant to Squog, who hesitantly takes it and eats it. But he ends up liking it, and hoots and jumps up and down as SpongeGar watches. He and SpongeGar then shake hands]
Squog: Taila foo, SpongeGar! Taila foo! SpongeGar na dumbo!
[A speech balloon appears from Squog's mouth with Albert Einstein in it. Later, SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog have a cookout. SpongeGar sticks a marshmallow-like plant through the stick, and roasts it in the fire and eats it. Squog does the same with a piece of coral. Patar toasts a stick and eats it, puncturing his lips]
SpongeGar: Patar! Uh-uh. Wa SpongeGar!
[Mr. Krabs' ancestor scuttles by]
Prehistoric Krabs: Money! Money! Ooga booga! Money! Money! Money! Money! Money! Ooga boo...Agh! [SpongeGar steps on him, takes Patar's stick, and impales him.]
Patar: [Patar takes the stick, puts it in the fire, and then eats it. He burps. The three jump up and down hooting and hollering. The scene freezes.]
Narrator: Hooray! It looks like our prehistoric pals have just discovered fire, but they will soon learn that when you play with fire, you may get burned. Stay tuned. [cut back to Patchy, who is laughing hysterically]
Patchy: I told you prehistoric times were fun! Hey! How's about I teach you kids how a caveman makes a fire with [holds up two sticks] two sticks? [he rubs them together] Yeah… Doesn't get any cooler than that, huh? Chalk one up for Patchy! [a 'I' is chalked up on the wall below a sign reading 'Prehistory'] Rubbing… [he pants. Nothing is happening, and he eventually gives up] I guess this is a type of wood that doesn't burn. [a laser shoots through and lights the two sticks on fire, startling Patchy] Potty! [we see Potty with a laser cannon on his back]
Potty: [squawk] Laser technology. Score one for the future. [cut to the digital screen next to the prehistory chalk labeled 'The Future.' The score goes from '00' to '01']
Patchy: Well, I have something that you'll never find in your little [air quotes] future: a real live caveman. Hmm… [the caveman walks in from behind] Hey, there he is! Come on in, little troglodyte fella. Come on… [the caveman is very slowly approaching] You see kids, I found him frozen in a block of ice and then I spent three days thawing him out with my mom's hair dryer. I call him Cavey. [the caveman approaches the camera, and recoils in horror. Patchy chuckles] Isn't he something? It's OK, Cavey. [another 'I' is chalked up for 'Prehistory']
Potty: That's nothing, old timer. Make way for the future. [a door swings up and a robot enters the room]
Robot: Greetings. I am the X-29488. How may I serve you? ['The Future' score goes from '01' to '02']
Patchy: Where do you keep getting all this stuff?
Potty: Never you mind, pops. Let's go see what Cavey thinks. [squawks. Cavey slowly approaches the robot, and touches it. The robot's eyes start flashing red. A siren goes off]
Robot: Attack!!!!!! Attack!!!!! [Cavey starts to run off and the robot gives slow chase, shooting lasers at him. For every shot, 'The Future' score keeps going up]
Patchy: Potty!! You're ruining me caveman show!
Robot: Attack!!!!! Attack!!!!!!!! [the robot continues to shoot lasers. Cut to the exterior, which is rumbling]
Narrator: Will Patchy ever get control of the special? [cut to SpongeGar, mesmerized by the fire] What will SpongeBob do with fire? [cut to the SpongeBob B.C. screen] Stay tuned to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. and find out! [fade on a black screen. commercial break. Cut back to Patchy's cave house, the house still rumbling]
Narrator: Welcome back to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. Sounds like things have gone from bad to worse for Patchy. Let's watch! [inside, the robot is still firing lasers, and Cavey throws a giant rock at him. Patchy is huddled behind the couch. Potty watches with a soda and popcorn]
Potty: [squawk] This is great.
Patchy: Ahoy, glad you're back. [ducks a laser] Let's watch the rest of SpongeBob B.C. while I get things straightened out around here. Whoa! [he ducks as a giant rock falls on him. He comes up dazed] Or… maybe not. [he collapses. Cut back to the freeze frame of Sponge, Pat, and Squog]
Narrator: When we last saw our hungry troglodytes, they just discovered fire. How long will it take for them to mess it up? Let's see. [scene continues as SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog continue to jump up and down hooting. They all run off. Sponge impales some long grass, toasts them, and eats them. Squog impales some primitive flowers and leaves, toasts them, and takes a bit out of them. Patar impales his loincloth, toasts that, and eats it. He burps up a charred piece and wipes his mouth with it, and then eats it. The three continue to find things to eat. SpongeGar twirls up some vines on the stick, toasts it, and slurps it up. Squog puts some rocks in a pan, toasts it, and it becomes popcorn. He eats some. Patar lifts up a rock, and a bunch of Money Krabs, like Mr. Krabs, crawl out. SpongeGar draws a circle in the sand, impales it, and lifts it, revealing a sand Krabby Patty. He toasts it. Cut to the three chewing vigorously. They all continue to eat, and they burp.]
Squog: Bolapa. [SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog  continue to run off, get something, toast it, and eat it. Over and over and over and over and over and over again, until eventually, they are on the ground, now much fatter, satisfied. They yawn and get up]
Squog: Ganoga, Patar. Ganoga, SpongeGar.
Patar: Ganoga, Squog. Ganoga, SpongeGar.
SpongeGar: Ganoga, Squog. Ganoga, Patar.
[The three walk back to their houses, but then halt. The three turn and look at the fire. Squog runs over and picks up the fire]
SpongeGar: No Squog fwee fwee! SpongeGar fwee fwee!
Squog: SpongeGar fagonda!
[SpongeGar shoves Squog. Squog is shocked and sets the log down and shoves him back for revenge. SpongeGar shoves Squog, and Squog whacks him with his club. SpongeGar hits Squog with his own club. The two continue to whack each other with clubs, while Patar retrieves the fire. He hoots excitedly as he runs back to his rock. Patar looks behind him to see if Squog and SpongeGar have caught up, and turns to see SpongeGar and Squog in front of him] 
Both: Patar!
[Patar screams, throwing the log into the air, where it stays. Squog is about to catch it when SpongeGar jumps on Squog's head and takes it instead]
Squog: Grrr... [SpongeGar runs off with it, but Patar takes it, then Squog Then, SpongeGar takes Squog mistake and chuckles nervously. Patar takes the log, then Squog again. It is then taken by SpongeGar. He falls into trap Patar made and Patar grabs it instead. He then is scared off by a picture held up by Squog] Dumbo Patar. Fwee fwee Squog! [He picks up the log, runs back to his house and searches for the key in his pocket. He gets it, but then realizes that the log is gone] Grrr...
[He sees SpongeGar running away with it but he falls victim of another Patar trap and drops the log. Patar grabs it and runs off happily]
SpongeGar: Patar! Bawana, Patar! Bawana.
Patar: Patar fwee fwee!
[He is tripped by Squog, and the log flies off. Squog chuckles and runs after the log as it rolls away. Patar joins Squogg, all chasing the log again]
Squog: Fwee fwee Squog! Fwee fwee Squog!
Patar: Patar fwee fwee!
SpongeGar: SpongeGar fwee fwee!
[The three chase it up a cliff, but it rolls back down and the chases them]
All: Fwee fwee go bonga!
[The chase is again reversed as the three follow the log. When it stops rolling, they all tug on it]
SpongeGar: SpongeGar fwee fwee!
Squog: Squog fwee fwee!
Patar: Patar fwee fwee!
[The fire is suddenly extinguished by more rain]
SpongeGar: Oh, Patar...
Patar: Oh, SpongeGar...
[SpongeGar and Patar cry]
SpongeGar: Oh, Patar...
Patar: Oh, SpongeGar...
Squog: Sutaka jakasa!!!!!! [He pulls out his club, but is struck by lightning. He falls to the ground, charred] ...Tabonga do.
[SpongeGar and Patar roast marshmallows over Squog]
Narrator: Perhaps certain events in history are better left untold [cut back to Patchy, depressed sitting on his front step]
Patchy: Now I know how Squidward feels… [Potty comes in]
Potty: [squawk] Why the long face?
Patchy: I think you know perfectly well, you little winged vermin. All I wanted was to show the nice people how great the cavemen were, but all they got was technology-induced chaos!
Potty: Come back inside. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Patchy: You got rid of the robot android cyborg?!
Potty: Nope, even better. [the two walk inside]
Patchy: [to Potty] Potty, I guess I really misjudged you… [he looks] What the-?!! [Cavey is at a drum set, and the robot is DJ-ing, as strobe lights go off]
Song: "When Worlds Collide"
When worlds collide
Potty: Pretty sweet, eh?
You can run
But no can hide
When worlds collide
You'll laugh so hard
You'll swear you've died
When worlds collide
Hold my hand
I'll be your guide
When worlds collide
Buckle...buckle...buckle up for the sweetest ride
And prepare to have your mind blown wide
When worlds collide
When worlds collide, it's a curious thing
Bet you never heard a robot and a caveman sing
In his metal chest are some working parts
How is that different from my beating heart?
I'm from the future, and I'm from the past
But that don't mean this friendship wasn't built to last
He was made in a lab, and I was born in a cave
So let me hear you holler for this inter-era rave
Squidward: Future!
Potty: Word!
SpongeTron: I am SpongeTron.
You, you, you, you can run
But no can hide
When worlds collide [Patchy shuts his mouth with his hook. The lighting returns to normal]
Patchy: Well Potty, I guess you were right. The future is cool.
Potty: Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I got you a present from the prehistoric times.
Patchy: Ooh! What is it? A new loincloth?
Potty: No.
Patchy: An enlarged forehead?
Potty: No. [Potty flies off]
Patchy: Aww, what is it? [Potty opens the door, revealing a T-rex, which growls at Patchy. Patchy screams, his eyes bugging out, he runs out, the t-rex giving chase] Potty!!! [he continues screaming as he runs off. Potty watches from the window, with popcorn and a soda]
Potty: [squawk] This is great. [the dinosaur has grabbed Patchy, who screams. Patchy is on his side, his feet inside the t-rex's jaws]
Patchy: Well, thanks for watching SpongeBob B.C. kids. [waves] Bye! [he continues screaming, then laughing] Now he's tickling! [he laughs] Cut it out, you rascal! [he continues laughing]


SpongeBob: Good morning, pineapple! [plays the bugle to wake Gary up] Good morning, Gary! [pats Gary's shell]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [opens his front door] Good morning, world! I'm ready! World? [scene pans over to Squidward's front door, where a delivery man with a pet cage walks over and knocks on his door]
Squidward: Talk to me.
Delivery Man: [waves hat] Package, sir.
Squidward: A-ha! [Squidward signs a clipboard] I can't believe it's finally here! [delivery man hands him the cage]
Delivery Man: Here ya go!
Squidward: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. [hands him the clipboard]
Delivery Man: Thank you, Mr... mmm... "Tennisballs."
Squidward: [winces, then scowls] That's Tentacles! [takes pet cage and slams the door shut]
SpongeBob: Squidward's last name is Tentacles?
Patrick: Poor guy. [Squidward walks out with a new snail with a bow on her shell] Hey, check out Squidward's new snail.
SpongeBob: [whistles as Squidward frowns] Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.
Squidward: Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob. [holding his snail smugly] I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred.
Patrick: Wow, a snail made out of bread.
Squidward: No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See? [holds up a certificate] She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training.
SpongeBob: Training?
Squidward: For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday.
Patrick: Sunday?
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!
Squidward: No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt. [Gary is shown looking like a hillbilly with a chimney in his shell]
SpongeBob: Boy, you got that right. Gary's no... [scowls] hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race? [Squidward shows the certificate again]
Squidward: Papers. [Patrick walks up and reads them]
Patrick: Hmmm. 'Property of Squidward... Tentpoles.'
Squidward: That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie. [walks off]
SpongeBob: You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Patrick: Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward! [Patrick runs off]
SpongeBob: Are you thinking what I'm thinking? [Gary imagines himself watching TV] No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail! [SpongeBob runs off. He then returns, wearing a coach's outfit] Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies! [laughs] I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use. [scene cuts to Sandy walking down the street]
Sandy: Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow. [scene cuts to SpongeBob opening a can]
SpongeBob: Kelp powder for muscle mass. [drops the food in a blender as Gary looks on with disgust] Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché. [drops the eggs in the blender] And nails for toughness. [drops the nails in the blender. Turns on the blender]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Of course, I expect you to eat this. [Gary's eyes widen. SpongeBob pours some of the blended food into a glass] It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary? [Gary is already out of the room through his snail door. SpongeBob stops his stopwatch] Wow, pretty good time.
Patrick: [holding a rock] Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.
SpongeBob: Patrick, your snail is a rock.
Patrick: Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Boy, the competition's getting tough. [walks over to Gary watching TV] That's it, Gary. [takes out a leash] We are going to start some serious training right now.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [puts the leash on Gary. Gary tries to stretch his eyes to watching the TV as long as he can before he's pulled out of the room] Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints. [holds up a stopwatch] On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary! [SpongeBob notices Gary is not there] Gary? [SpongeBob walks up to Gary, who is watching more TV] Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.
Squidward: [pops his head in SpongeBob's lower window] Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.
Patrick: [pops his head in SpongeBob's upper window] Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail. [shows his rock]
Squidward: Patrick, that's a rock.
Patrick: Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.
Squidward: What are you standing on, anyway? [scene shows Patrick is standing on Squidward's shoulders] Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow. [Squidward walks off as Patrick falls to the ground. Patrick pops his head in the lower window]
Patrick: My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do. [picks up Gary and walks off]
Patrick: You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Gary outside]
SpongeBob: Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious. [scene cuts to SpongeBob blowing on a whistle] Come on, Gary, move it! [scene cuts to Gary crawling up and down a wall] Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down! [scene cuts to Gary punching a punching bag with his eyes] Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go! [scene cuts to SpongeBob following Gary on his bike] Come on, push it, Gary, push it! [scene cuts to Gary on the toilet] Move that shell! [scene cuts to Gary in the bathtub with SpongeBob looking through the curtains] Come on, Gary, move it! [scene cuts to Gary eating] Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster! [scene cuts to nighttime. Gary is on an exercise wheel while SpongeBob is sleeping but giving orders at the same time] Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it... [scene cuts to morning, where Gary is tired, out of breath, and on a leash] Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke. [Gary is pulling SpongeBob in a wagon] Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race! [scene cuts to an announcer]
Nat: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our live coverage of this year's annual spring classic, the 102nd Running of the Snail. And what a beautiful day for this sport of kings, of which I am a huge fan. Seriously, I'm just a fan. I was on my way to my seat, the door was open.
Perch Perkins: Hey, what are you doing?! [Nat runs away as the announcer comes and sits down] Heh, sorry about that, folks. Let's go down to the field to join the mayor for the pre-game ceremony. [scene cuts to a large fish standing by a microphone]
Mayor: And now, for the lighting of the Torch of Good Sportsmanship, please join me in welcoming snail racing's first-ever champion, Lightning Larry Luciano! [crowd cheers as the band plays. Larry comes crawling out every so slowly with a flame attached on his back]
Perch Perkins: Would you look at that, folks? Lightning Larry Luciano, a living legend, slowly making his way center stage. And what a proud moment for this sport. The crowd is going absolutely nuts... [crowd is cheering] ...for Larry. [Larry is still crawling to the torch] He's almost there. Uhh, yes, any minute now.
Narrator: Two hours later... [band is not playing as loud]
Perch Perkins: He's almost a quarter of the way there. [As Larry is still crawling up to the torch, one of the band members faints after playing for 2 hours. The mayor checks his watch, then runs over, grabs Larry and lights the torch]
Mayor: The torch is lit! Let the race begin. [the crowd cheers. Cut to the playing field, where SpongeBob and Squidward are standing at the starting line. The snails have markers: Snellie is #6, a very worn out Gary is #7, and Rocky is #8]
Squidward: Well, SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life. [Gary is coughing]
Squidward: I'll alert the paramedics.
Patrick: [laughs] Good one, Squidward.
Official: [walks up to the contestants] You guys ready?
Patrick: [screams] A burglar!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's the official.
Official: We're ready to start here, folks.
Squidward: Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.
Snellie: Meow.
SpongeBob: Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.
Gary: Meow.
Patrick: This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here. [official raises the flag]
Official: On your mark. Get set. [lowers the flag] Slither! [Snellie runs out first]
Perch Perkins: And they're off! Number six, Snellie, rockets out of the starting blocks, leaving the other two competitors in the dust!
SpongeBob: What! [runs over to Gary]
Squidward: Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!
SpongeBob: What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!
Patrick: It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.
SpongeBob: Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now! [gross close-up on Gary] Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary! [SpongeBob jumps up and down while Gary is moving slowly] Go, go, go, go, go!
Perch Perkins: And there goes number 7 out of the starting gate. Oh, hang on, folks. He doesn't look so good.
SpongeBob: Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster! [Gary tries to go faster]
Perch Perkins: I do not like the look of this.
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?! [Gary eyes are now really small]
Perch Perkins: That coach is pushing that snail too hard!
SpongeBob: Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster! [Gary's left eye explodes] Huh? [crowd gasps]
Perch Perkins: Oh, looks like number 7 has a blowout! [Gary's other eye explodes] Oops, make that two, folks.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Gary? [Gary's shell breaks, showing a machine inside]
Perch Perkins: Plus, a blown head gasket! Oh, and the poor creature's still going for it.
SpongeBob: [getting worried] Umm, Gary, you can stop now! [Gary is leaving skid marks on the track]
Perch Perkins: He's losing control! [Gary is running into the walls, making a bunch of sparks]
SpongeBob: You can take a break now if you want to, Gary. [Gary is spinning on the track]
Perch Perkins: He's spinning out of control! [crowd gasps] He's heading straight for the wall! [Gary runs into a wall of tires and explodes. The crowd gasps again, then they cheer]
SpongeBob: No! [two firemen come up and extinguish the smoke. Squidward laughs] Hold on, Gary, I'm coming! [runs onto the track]
Perch Perkins: Whoa. One of the coaches seems to have raced onto the track. That is an automatic disqualification. Looks like number six has this race all wrapped up, ladies and gentlemen. [Snellie is coming up on the finish line]
Squidward: Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!
SpongeBob: [runs up to Gary, crying] Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You did? [cries more] Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You did? [cries some more] Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!
Snellie: Meow. [Snellie turns around and heads straight to Gary to help him]
Squidward: What?! [Gary notices Snellie racing towards him and he is back to normal now]
SpongeBob: Gary? [Gary and Snellie start purring at each other] Oh!
Crowd: Aww!
Perch Perkins: [laughs] My, oh, my. Folks, I have never seen anything quite like this. It seems Snellie, the leader, just went back to comfort Gary. [Squidward walks up to where the snails are at]
SpongeBob: Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?
Squidward: But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then... [Rocky is at the finish line]
Announcer: And the winner is Rocky! [Patrick cries, the crowd goes wild and Gary and Snellie crawl away]
Squidward: I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock. [Patrick walks over with the trophy he won]
Patrick: Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.
Squidward: Gosh, Patrick, thanks. [reads the engraving] The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward... [we see the engraving and the camera zooms in on Squidward's misspelled last name] ...Tortellini?! Will I ever win? [he, SpongeBob, and Patrick laugh. Sandy comes on-screen and kicks SpongeBob in the air. He and Patrick stop laughing]
Sandy: [angrily] That's for yesterday, SquarePants!


[Mr. Krabs wakes up in his hammock in his bedroom. The radio clicks on]
Radio DJ: You've got it tuned to K-O-L-D, K-Old, your all-oldies station. Here's a little something you may remember from the good old days.
♪You're old... Groaning like a geezer♪ [Mr. Krabs opens his eyes, which are crusty and coated in barnacles] ♪Feel yourself a-crackin' like an old has-been♪ [Mr. Krabs gets out of bed with all his joints cracking when he moves] ♪Look at yourself, old man, you've got multiple chins♪ [Mr. Krabs looks in his bathroom mirror. He pulls down his shirt to show a bunch of chins] ♪'Cause you're old...♪ [scene cuts to the kitchen. Mr. Krabs sits down at the table as Pearl comes in]
Pearl Krabs: Good morning, Daddy. [gives him a kiss] I made you breakfast.
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, sweet pea. I see you got creative with the bran today. [looks down at the plate to see his bran shaped as bacon, eggs, juice, and others]
Pearl: Open up, it's time for the pill. [Pearl takes out a giant pill]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill. [Pearl shoves the giant pill in his mouth and he swallows it] Pearl, do you think I'm... old?
Pearl: Well, of course I do! But that's okay. Daddies are supposed to be old.
Mr. Krabs: But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?
Pearl: See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old-person thing. Now we say "coral," as in, "That nose job is so coral."
Mr. Krabs: Coral, eh?
Pearl: Eww, when you say it, it sounds so uncoral.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-ral.
Pearl: Don't you have to go to work or something, Dad?
Mr. Krabs: Whoop, you're right! [eats his breakfast] Have a coral day, honey.
Pearl: [picks up her phone and dials] Jenny? It's Pearl. "Coral" is definitely out. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs walking outside]
Mr. Krabs: Ha! Old? What was I thinkin'? I ain't old. Huh? [turns around to see a boy helping him walk across]
Boy Scout: Don't worry, Pops, we're almost across the street.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, get away from me. I don't need no snot-nosed little... [as he walks away, his arm comes off. Walks back to get it] Sorry you had to see that. [keeps walking to work where a fish is walking behind him]
Harold: Come on, move it! Could you be any slower? And you've had your blinker on for the last five blocks. [Mr. Krabs turns around and notices he has two signals on his behind, the right arrow is blinking, so he covers his behind. He continues to walk until a ball rolls next to him]
Tyler: Hey, mister, could you throw the ball back over here?
Mr. Krabs: [picks up the ball] Hey, how's about I join you kids?
Tyler: Uhh, that's okay. You can keep it. Why do old people always have to ruin the fun? [Mr. Krabs drops the ball. He walks up to a line of elderly fish]
Elderly Fish #1: Hey, no cuttin'! You gotta wait your turn in line like everybody else! [Mr. Krabs notices a long line in front of the Bikini Bottom Cemetery]
Mr. Krabs: No! No! I ain't old like you! I ain't old! I ain't old! [runs away]
Elderly Fish #2: What's his problem? [the line is for ice cream]
Lou: Next? [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is sitting a table depressed]
Timmy: Mommy, my Krabby Patty tastes funny.
Mother: Well, no wonder. It's all old and dried out. Like that man right there. [points to Mr. Krabs] Now put that thing where it belongs... in the garbage.
Timmy: ♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la...♪ [Timmy walks up to the trashcan, but Mr. Krabs grabs his patty before he can get there]
Mr. Krabs: Well, little patty, we're two of a kind. We've both lost our luster. [takes a bite out of the patty] Hmmm, so that's what I taste like.
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew! [SpongeBob pokes his head out of the kitchen window]
SpongeBob: [shouts] Hey, Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?
Patrick: [shouts] Yeah, it's gonna rock!
SpongeBob: Are you ready to go crazy?
Patrick: I'm already hearing voices!
SpongeBob: Are you ready to—
Squidward: SpongeBob! Patrick! Do you mind?!
SpongeBob: Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!
Patrick: Well, how rude of some people!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, those youngsters are goin’ out for a big night on the town. [stretches his eyes into the kitchen where SpongeBob and Patrick are talking]
SpongeBob: Whoo! I've been lookin’ forward to this night all week!
Patrick: Party!
SpongeBob: What do you think we should do first?
Patrick: What shouldn't we do first? We're young, [Mr. Krabs' eyes move a little closer] we've got wheels, [Mr. Krabs' eyes move closer] the world is our oyster! SpongeBob, you got something on your shoulder. [SpongeBob notices Mr. Krabs' eyes are on his shoulders]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boys, hangin' out?
Patrick: [looks at his large belly] Yes.
Mr. Krabs: I couldn't help overhearin’ your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?
SpongeBob: Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hadn't even crossed me mind. But, sure, I'll go!
Patrick: I don't know, SpongeBob. He might cramp our style.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [appear in a picture with a goofy look on them] Style!
Patrick: Let's see if he knows the secret cool-guy handshake. [holds out his hand]
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, yeah, course I know it! [begins to sweat] Uhh... uhh...
Patrick: I'm waiting... old man.
Mr. Krabs: [shakes Patrick's hand] Uhh... how do you do?
Patrick: Fine, and you? All right, you're in. But I'm not happy about it.
SpongeBob: You passed the test, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Great! Why don't you boys show up at my house at eight o'clock?
SpongeBob: I just wanna warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late.
French Narrator: 8:01 PM. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' house. The doorbell rings]
SpongeBob: Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party?
Patrick: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick?
Patrick: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to par- [Pearl runs by them]
Pearl: Stop it, just stop it! You're embarrassing me, Dad! [sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: So, what kind of hot rod will we be cruisin’ in tonight?
SpongeBob: Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker. [we see a bike with two streamers on each handle]
Mr. Krabs: It's more like a chick repellent. And there's only two seats.
SpongeBob: Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself. [scene cuts to SpongeBob &amp; Patrick riding at the front of the bike, while Mr. Krabs is in a wagon behind them]
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure this is what the kids are drivin’ these days?
SpongeBob: Only the cool kids. [a hot rod, driven by a young teen, pulls up beside them]
Hot rod fish: Hey, you guys must be lost. Doofus Drive is around the corner!
SpongeBob: We're not lost, I've got my compass. [shows him the compass]
Hot rod fish: So long, dorks! [speeds away]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, pals!
Mr. Krabs: We used to beat people up for sayin’ things like that! Everything's all topsy-turvy now. [they pull up to 'The Wash']
SpongeBob: Here we are: The Wash.
Mr. Krabs: They sure are giving these clubs some crazy names! I have to tell you boys... I'm a little nervous. I haven't been, you know, on the scene for quite a while now.
SpongeBob: Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool.
Mr. Krabs: Cool. Gotcha. [SpongeBob and Patrick walk away jumping up and down in a goofy way. Mr. Krabs does the same]
SpongeBob: [opens door] Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back!
Patrick: Let's party!
Mr. Krabs: Any port in the store—! Wait a minute...this is a Laundromat. [scene shows the entire room is a place to do your laundry]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [all three looking at their reflections in the washer] Oh yeah, whoo! That's what I'm talkin’ about. Oh, yeah! Yeah, the colors! whoo! [washer stops]
SpongeBob: You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buyin’.
Mr. Krabs: You know, I love staring at delicates as much as the next guy, but it's just that I thought we'd see more of the nightlife. Somethin’ that'll give you that wild and crazy hot-blooded feelin’, if you know what I mean.
SpongeBob: Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery!
Patrick: Debauchery!
Mr. Krabs: Debauchery! [scene cuts to the road where all three are picking up trash] Debauchery? I never thought of picking up trash under the highway as hot-blooded, but if it's what the kids are into...
SpongeBob: So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Not yet.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, you will. [scene cuts to all three in a kiddie swimming pool] Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm feeling a warm spot.
Patrick: Sorry. [scene cuts to them riding kiddie rides outside Barg'n Mart]
SpongeBob: Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it?
Patrick: I'm feeling it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Patrick, that's not a ride. [Patrick is riding on Harold's back]
Harold: Get off of me! [scene cuts to them getting their teeth pulled]
SpongeBob: Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [scene cuts to them redoing a roof] Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [scene cuts to them dressed in costumes playing Dungeons and Dragons] Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [scene cuts to the library] You're feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?
Miss Shell: [pops out] Shhh! [scene cuts to a place called "Bunny Buns," an area for kids to play in]
SpongeBob: How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? [kids in the room around running around Mr. Krabs, hanging on his hat streamers. Mr. Krabs has clown make-up on his face]
Kids: Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: So, you wanna know if I can feel it?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Do you really wanna know if I can feel it?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah, yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Because I can feel it. You wanna know what I'm feelin'?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yes!
Mr. Krabs: [angry] I'm feelin' like a total barnacle head! [swings the screaming kids around and around then off his hat] You think this is cool?! [jumps on a bunny and punches its head off] How about this! [jumps on top of the bunny] And this? Am I with it now? [runs up to SpongeBob and Patrick] You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the end! I'm goin’ home. You guys ain't cool. You're lame!
SpongeBob: [sadly] Lame?!
Mr. Krabs: Lame! You're nerds! Geeks! Creeps! And babies!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Not 'babies!' [both suck their thumbs]
Mr. Krabs: I may be old, but even an old bag of shells like me knows that you haven't suggested one cool thing all night! So good night to ya!
Patrick: I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Mr. Krabs: The what?
Patrick: I said, I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Mr. Krabs: Panty raid? You're talkin’ about girls, right? “Girl” girls?
Patrick: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And you're talkin’ about raidin’ their dressers for their underpants, right?
Patrick: Oh, yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two bein’ lame!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [happy] Not lame! [scene cuts to the three of them carrying a ladder]
Mr. Krabs: Now this is more like it! [lean the ladder against a house]
Patrick: Give us some credit, old man. We're panty professionals! [climbs the ladder]
SpongeBob: We score here all the time. [all three tiptoe into a bedroom. Mr. Krabs opens a drawer and takes out a pair of panties]
Mr. Krabs: Frilly things! We hit the jackpot! [everyone jumps up and down]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [holds up the pair of underwear he got] You finally came through for me, boys! I feel young again! [light turns on]
Mama Krabs: Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Mother?
Mama Krabs: What are you doing with my bloomers?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I, uhh, uhh, heh, [hides his mother's bloomers behind his back] hehe... [turns around to SpongeBob and Patrick] Why didn't you tell me this was my mother's house?!
SpongeBob: Why didn't you ask? [both run away. Mr. Krabs turns around to see his mother angry]
Mr. Krabs: [he giggles nervously then he hides his mother's bloomers behind his back] But it was all SpongeBob and Patrick's idea!
Mama Krabs: Go to your room, mister. You're grounded for the rest of the night!
Mr. Krabs: [walks away] Yes, Mommy. [boy scout from earlier is walking with Mr. Krabs]
Boy Scout: Don't worry, Pops. We're almost to your room. [Mr. Krabs groans. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' bedroom. SpongeBob peeks through the window]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger. [scene zooms out revealing Mr. Krabs is lying on his racecar-shaped bed among a few toys]
SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Good night, SpongeBob.
Mama Krabs: [outside. We see SpongeBob leaving] Eugene, lights out!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, Mommy. [light turns off]


Squidward: [Evening at the Krusty Krab. He switches the 'open' sign to 'closed.' Appears very optimistic.] Closing time. The happiest time of the day! [scene cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen crying and sniffling]
SpongeBob: Closing time. [sniffles] The saddest time of the day! [falls on the ground still crying] Huh? [he notices an old Patty under the grill] It's a Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob tries to pick it up but it's stuck to some gum] Eww... It's cold and hard. [takes the Patty out from under the grill] This could have rolled under there years ago. [pats it on the head] There, there, little one, your journey is almost over. [SpongeBob tosses the Patty in the trash. A siren goes off as a fishing line retrieves the patty]
Mr. Krabs: [runs in] What happened? [gasps then runs up to the trash can] Someone tried to throw away a patty! [takes it off the hook]
Pinch-o-matic: Pinch-o-matic has saved you 5.2 cents.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill.
Mr. Krabs: And tomorrow, a customer will find it under his bun. [hands it to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.
Mr. Krabs: You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?
Narrator: The next day...
SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward. [puts the tray with the old Patty on the window]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Hooray. [smells the Patty then flips the top bun off. Flies buzz around the stinking patty.] Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.
Squidward: Whatever. [he hands the tray to Gus] Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty. [Gus sniffs it. He screams with disgust and quickly back-flips his way out of the restaurant. Scene cuts to the Krusty crew standing by the door.]
Mr. Krabs: I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?
Squidward: What? [splutters in frustration at Krabs' stupidity] Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.
Mr. Krabs: Gone bad? That's nonsense! Bring it here, SpongeBob. [picks up the cage with the Patty inside it] Uh, why is it in a cage?
SpongeBob: Because it growled at me. [Patty is now sentient and starts to growl and bark like some sort of dog. Squidward hides behind Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are. [takes the Patty out of its cage but it still barks and growls in Mr. Krabs' face] No... no... [the Patty barks and growls some more] Stay... [throws a 'treat' into its mouth] Thatta girl! There, there. [He pats it gently] See? Good enough to eat. [about to eat it when an ambulance goes by] Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then... [Takes a bite. Scene cuts to him moaning, now green in color due to food poisoning, being rolled on a hospital bed] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet! [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs in a hospital bed]
Purple Doctorfish: Well, Mr. Krabs, you gave us quite the scare.
Mr. Krabs: So I'm gonna be okay, doc?
Purple Doctorfish: Well, if you don't want to take my word for it, let's just check your chart. [looks at the chart] Let's see here. Hmmm... oh, no! [starts to shake] Oh no, this is terrible! [drops the clipboard]
Mr. Krabs: Everything okay, doc?
Purple Doctorfish: Don't touch me! [runs out screaming]
Mr. Krabs: That's not a good sign. [thunder roars as the room turns into green. The Flying Dutchman appears. Mr. Krabs pulls his covers over his head, showing he's scared.]
Flying Dutchman: Har, har har har har har har har har har!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!
Flying Dutchman: Eugene Krabs, your time has come.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh... [looks at the flower vase next to him] Flower!
Flying Dutchman: Oh, sorry. I must have the wrong room. [flies out] Excuse me, nurse?
Nurse: [in a happy, musical tone] Yes?
Flying Dutchman: I'm looking for Eugene Krabs.
Nurse: Oh, he's in that room right there.
Flying Dutchman: No, that's Harold Flower's room.
Nurse: [confused] Harold Flower? [Flying Dutchman goes back to Mr. Krabs in anger]
Flying Dutchman: So, Krabs, you thought you could fool the Flying Dutchman?
Mr. Krabs: What do you want from me?
Flying Dutchman: I'm here to escort you to the resting place of all bad undersea folk: Davy Jones' locker!
Mr. Krabs: Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!
Flying Dutchman: Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing. Next stop, Davy Jones' locker! [Evil laughs. Scene cuts to Davey Jones' locker where Flying Dutchman and Mr. Krabs reappear] Here we are.
Mr. Krabs: [smells something nasty] Blec! Why does it smell so foul?
Flying Dutchman: Davy Jones works out a lot. [opens the locker where a bunch of smelly gym socks are] These are his socks. Get in!
Mr. Krabs: [gets on his knees and starts crying] Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!
Flying Dutchman: Come on, Krabs, show a little dignity.
Mr. Krabs: [Frantically] Mommy!
Flying Dutchman: Alright, alright, stop your crying. I'll give you another chance, but you must always be generous, never cheap.
Mr. Krabs: You have me word as a sailor. [scene cuts to the dilapidated Krusty Krab where a sign hangs over it that says 'Out of Business']
Squidward: [looking through Mr. Krabs desk drawers] Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these. [SpongeBob is wearing his hat and holding his spatula, crying]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings. [sniffs] He won't like it!
Squidward: SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back. [Wears a stethoscope. Tries to open the safe, putting a stethoscope onto the safe to avoid suspicion.] Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe. [Mr. Krabs walks in]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boys! [SpongeBob screams with joy as Squidward sheepishly hides his stethoscope behind his back]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive! [clings to Mr. Krabs happily] Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?
Squidward: [Deadpan] Well, it was.
Mr. Krabs: You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money, [mimics being infatuated to money] touching money... [returns back to normal talking] Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs. [scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where a giant 'Grand Re-Opening' sign is hanging. 'Buy' and 'Free' signs are in the window] Welcome all, welcome! [a little kid walks up to Krabs] Hello, little one. What you got there?
Monroe: A Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?
Monroe: I don't go hungry?
Mr. Krabs: No, silly! It means free toy! [gives him a little toy]
Monroe: Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad.
Mr. Krabs: I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills! [everyone cheers. Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob] Hello, boy! Say, where's Squidward?
SpongeBob: Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'. [scene cuts to Squidward sleeping peacefully in a bed in Mr. Krabs' office]
Mr. Krabs: [Joyfully] Great!
Martha: Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes sir. [takes the patty and lifts the top bun where a disclaimer, written in ketchup form, is shown] Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [puts down the bun] That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir. [goes into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Sorry about the confusion. [pulls out a toy] Free toy? [Martha takes it, looking confused]
Squidward: Eugene, my man.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! How's the break coming?
Squidward: Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you? [Winks then walks off]
Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy. [walks up to a customer watching a movie on a small television hanging from the ceiling] Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?
Harold: This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!
Mr. Krabs: [pats the customer on the back] No expense spared for my valued customers. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob standing in front of the restaurant] Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.
Squidward: [walks in with some envelopes] Here's your mail, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.
Squidward: Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me. [stretches and yawns a little]
Mr. Krabs: Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is. [opens the envelope] Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad. [runs up to the cash register] I'll just subtract it from today's profit. [opens the register, but it's empty] And...there's no money in here. [laughs] How delightful.
SpongeBob: Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Me, too. How are we gonna get paid? [both walk up to Mr. Krabs] Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon. [SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other surprised]
Squidward: Uh... "dream"?
Mr. Krabs: Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!
SpongeBob: Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.
Squidward: Here's the bill. [hands Mr. Krabs the bill from earlier]
Mr. Krabs: You mean... I'm awake? [he screams as his head cracks through the middle over and over. Each time he cracks his head open, a new one appears. He races up to Nat drinking a Mountain Dew-like drink and he confiscates it from him] No more refills! [takes it to the soda machine and the drink gets sucked back into it like a vacuum. Then he runs up to two kids playing with toys. He steals them also.] Give me back them toys, you freeloaders! [He then runs back over to Harold watching the movie earlier] Show's over, cheapskate! [turns the TV off then presses a button that erases his memory of the movie. Harold goes dizzy.]
Nathiel Waters: Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny! [reaches for the penny]
Mr. Krabs: [grabs a hold of the customer's arm] Your luck just ran out!
Nathiel Waters: Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm.
Mr. Krabs: Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off. [Flying Dutchman reappears. The customer runs away]
Flying Dutchman: A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... For eternity!
Mr. Krabs: I'm not cheap, I'm generous!
Squidward: You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.
Mr. Krabs: [sarcastically] Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you. [Flying Dutchman picks him up] Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.
SpongeBob: Wait just a burger-flipping second!
[Flying Dutchman turns around]
Flying Dutchman: Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?
SpongeBob: That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea. [Mr. Krabs is happy at SpongeBob's words]
Flying Dutchman: He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.
SpongeBob: I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.
Flying Dutchman: You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?
Mr. Krabs: That depends, how much money we talking about?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Flying Dutchman: [shows money] 62 cents.
Mr. Krabs: I'll take the money.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Flying Dutchman: Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents. [hands him the change and picks up SpongeBob] Next stop: Davy Jones' locker! [SpongeBob screams as they both disappear]
Mr. Krabs: [Runs to Squidward, happy] Look, Squidward, money!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?
Mr. Krabs: You think I could've gotten more?
Squidward: He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!
Mr. Krabs: [Briefly looks at his change in a sad way until he starts to cry.] Oh, what have I done? [cries] I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money! [throws the change on the ground] I want SpongeBob back! [Flying Dutchman reappears and drops SpongeBob on the floor]
Flying Dutchman: Here, take him back.
Mr. Krabs: You heard what I said about the money?
Flying Dutchman: Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Flying Dutchman at Davy Jones' locker with SpongeBob talking a lot] And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!
SpongeBob: [In the Davy Jones' locker scene, talking simultaneously with the Flying Dutchman's explanations, talking super quickly] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!
Flying Dutchman: He's your problem now. [laughs evilly as he disappears]
Mr. Krabs: Heh, about trading you for pocket change...
SpongeBob: Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.
Mr. Krabs: You would have?
SpongeBob: No. [all laugh. Scene cuts to the Flying Dutchman sitting on a chair, reading a book until the phone rings]
Flying Dutchman: [picks up phone] Dutchman's residence.
SpongeBob: [on the other end, talking super quickly] So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work. [Flying Dutchman groans] I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.


Patrick: [screaming while flying on his sandboard, then bashes his body on mountain. The word “DEAD” flashes, also making a "dead" sound effect]
[Screen zooms out, revealing that Patrick is only playing a video game with his character while sandboarding down Sand Mountain]
Patrick: Aww, I got dead again. This game stinks. [hits a rock and flies and screams then bashes his body on mountain just like on his game]
Sandy: See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.
SpongeBob: I'm listening to you, mountain! [starts sandboarding, and he passes by Patrick's legs] Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, yeah, I forgot. [eats yellow sand on a plate]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, watch me do the "Grouchy Squidward".
Squidward: [sits at a table drinking tea close to the mountain] Stop naming moves after me!
SpongeBob: [imitating Squidward] Everybody's an idiot except for me.
Squidward: Well, it's true. [takes a sip]
[SpongeBob laughs like Squidward, Sandy and Patrick laugh with him]
Sandy: [stops laughing and gasps] SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!
SpongeBob: [stops laughing like Squidward] Huh? [avoids tree with scuba diving gear on it] Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, ‘cause I'm an... [hits a log and he goes off the mountain] Expert...! [suddenly stops in mid-air] Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down. [camera reveals that SpongeBob is upside down and not the mountain and he screams as he falls]
Sandy: SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!
SpongeBob: [makes himself right-side up and he takes off his pants] Like this?
Patrick: No, your other bottom!
Sandy: Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?
Patrick: Not until 4.
[SpongeBob crashes into the ground and his bottom breaks into tiny pieces]
Sandy: Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
Patrick: Do it again! I wasn't looking!
[Cuts to the doctor's office]
Doctor: Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.
SpongeBob: My what has a what now?
Doctor: Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing. [he turns an x-ray on] It took twenty hours to put it all back together. [he holds a stapler] We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick [he holds a glue stick]. Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, I'd like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there. [points to where the fish is] [we see Tom and his butt is in a giant machine] In the Iron Butt.
Tom: [in the Iron Butt] Aww, man. It itches.
SpongeBob: [outside hospital] You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol. [sees Harold behind him] Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!
Harold: What's your problem? [leaves SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Whew. That was close.
Football Player: Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us? We need an extra player. [another football player catches a football] Nice catch, Percy! [slaps Percy's bottom, SpongeBob cringes as he holds his butt]
Jimmy: Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams as he turns around, while holding his butt] You've gotta try this, dude! We finally got enough people for a seven-mile spanking machine! [crawls between people's legs, who each take turns spanking his butt] Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch.
Martin: Next. 
SpongeBob: No! [screams as he runs off. Everybody looks at him]
Squidward: Is this where the line starts? 
SpongeBob: My butt is not safe out here! [runs inside his house and closes the door] No part of me is safe! [closes the window curtain] 
[Patrick and Sandy return from another trip from Sand Mountain] 
Sandy: Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy! [Patrick starts laughing as they enter SpongeBob's house] Hey, SpongeBob! 
Patrick: [is still laughing while riding on Sandy's back; Sandy glares at him and he gets off her back as well as clearing his throat afterwards] That was fun. [he stops smiling] 
Sandy: [Patrick smiles again] Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob? 
[SpongeBob is sitting in a fetal position in the middle of the floor, with a penny, a potato chip, and a wadded-up napkin lying on the floor in front of him] 
SpongeBob: [with a little smile on his face] Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world? 
Sandy: Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that? 
SpongeBob: Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again. 
Sandy: That's crazy talk! 
Patrick: That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk. [does various forms of gibberish blabbing, but his third blabbing makes his saliva hit Sandy, making her hammer-fist him to shut him up, bashing his head in] Sorry. 
SpongeBob: No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead. 
Patrick: Or your other armpit! 
SpongeBob: I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary. 
Sandy: Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome? 
SpongeBob: I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny... [holds up a penny] and Chip... [holds up a potato chip] and say hello to Used Napkin. [holds up a used napkin] 
Sandy: Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab? 
SpongeBob: No problem! [he grabs the end of a spatula, which is so long it stretches all the way inside the Krusty Krab] A really long spatula. [flips a patty with the really long spatula] 
Sandy: What about eating? 
SpongeBob: I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed. [breathes in a different and weird way] 
Sandy: SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside! 
SpongeBob: Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again. 
Patrick: Never ever? 
SpongeBob: Never ever ever! 
Patrick: Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?! 
SpongeBob: Never ever never never ever ever never!! 
Patrick: Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?! 
SpongeBob: [sighs exasperatedly] Never ever... 
SpongeBob and Patrick: Never never never never ever never ever never… 
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door? [throws Chip to the door, opening it, and Patrick and an angry Sandy leave] 
Patrick: Thank you, Chip. [closes the door. Outside, Sandy is still glaring at SpongeBob] I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward! 
Squidward: [pops out of his window] No! [slams his window shut] 
Patrick: Aww! 
Sandy: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of. 
Patrick: And that's when I [holds a boxing glove] punch him, right? [Sandy gives a bummed look. Patrick and Sandy are jellyfishing outside SpongeBob's house] 
Sandy: Look at all the jellyfish out here. Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun. 
Patrick: [catches a jellyfish] I caught one! [puts head in net and his jellyfish sticks to his face] Huh? 
SpongeBob: [Patrick gets electrocuted in the background, making him scream in pain] Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting. [puts on a pair of glasses and a tiny net and waves it in the air] I think I caught one! 
Sandy: We've got to try something else! 
[Patrick and Sandy are holding a cake in front of SpongeBob's house] 
Sandy and Patrick: ♪Three cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob! Three cheers for you!♪ 
Sandy: Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish. 
SpongeBob: I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. ♪I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!♪ Take it away, Penny! [the penny lies silently on the floor] 
Patrick: [sniffles] That penny has the most beautiful voice. 
Sandy: [goes inside the window to angrily point at a smiling SpongeBob] That is it, SquarePants! We're gonna find you something that's so dang fun that you'll have to come outside! [goes outside] 
Sandy: [jumps on a trampoline] Trampoline! 
Patrick: [holds an ice cream cone] Ice cream. 
Sandy: [surfs on an underwater wave] Underwater surfing! 
Patrick: [holds two ice cream cones] Two ice creams. 
Sandy: [rides on a Ferris wheel] Ferris wheel! 
Patrick: [the two ice creams are melting] Still two ice creams. 
Sandy: [struggling with a giant clam] Clam wrestling! 
Patrick: [washes an old man in a tub] Washing an old person. 
Sandy: Patrick, that's not fun. 
Old man: It is for me! 
[SpongeBob is still "filter-feeding", and Sandy and Patrick watch him through his window] 
Sandy: Nothing's working, Patrick! 
Patrick: What do we do? 
Old man: [appearing from below] I say we take a bath! 
Sandy: Wha...will you get out of here? 
[Patrick and Sandy are hiding behind a coral bush and Patrick is in a gorilla suit] 
Sandy: Now remember. Don't jump out until I give the signal. 
Patrick: Right. [he zips up his mask] 
Sandy: [opens the door] All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat! [Patrick comes out in the gorilla suit and acts crazy like a gorilla] Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year. 
Sandy: [Patrick continues dancing] No, really! You've got to come and save me! [Suddenly, a second Patrick shows up out of nowhere with an ice cream] 
Patrick #2: Hey, Sandy, [SpongeBob gives a startled look] who's your friend?
Sandy: [Confused] But you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit.
Patrick #1: I am in the gorilla suit. [unzips the gorilla suit] I thought I was doing a pretty good job.
Sandy: If you're Patrick, then who's that? [The two look at second Patrick who unzips his head, which reveals a real gorilla underneath which scares them!] Ah! A real gorilla!
SpongeBob: [Shocked] Huh?! [The gorilla rips out of the Patrick suit it is wearing. Sandy and Patrick are screaming. The gorilla grabs the scared Patrick and Sandy, puts them in a bag, and repeatedly beats them] Oh, my gosh! [Sandy and Patrick are still screaming while the gorilla beats them] This can't be happening! [The gorilla hits Patrick and Sandy using a chair, then beating them some more] This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about! [the gorilla can be seen still beating up the sack outside the window; it also does things like dribbling the sack and bouncing on it like it's a ball] Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary.
Gary: [eats Chip, killing him] Meow.
SpongeBob: [looks behind] Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world. [gulps and shakes as he reaches for the door. The door shakes as well until SpongeBob opens it] I'm taking my [walks slowly] first step. [continues walking] So far, so good. I think I can do this! [the wind blows a piece of paper onto his face; SpongeBob screams] Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me! [Squidward waters his plants and rolls his eyes and SpongeBob removes the paper off his face] I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now! [the gorilla grabs SpongeBob] Is it too late to go back inside again? [the gorilla rips SpongeBob in half]
1st half of SpongeBob: It's too late. [the gorilla screeches] Patrick? Sandy?
Patrick and Sandy: [still in the bag] Yes, SpongeBob?
1st half of SpongeBob: I'm sorry I caused all this. I'm not scared of going outside anymore. But I'm terrified of gorillas now.
Sandy: [shaken] Ah, that's okay, SpongeBob. Us too.
First half of SpongeBob: You know what I don't understand though? [moves to the second half of SpongeBob]
Second half of SpongeBob: What?
First half of SpongeBob: What's the gorilla doing underwater in the first place? [the gorilla's eyes widen]
Gorilla: [man's voice] Oh! Well, it's funny you should, uh, you see, George, they're on to us! [A zebra rushes onto the screen]
George: Let's get outta here! [the gorilla gets on George and rides away with him. Patrick, Sandy, and the two halves of SpongeBob are watching the gorilla ride on George into the sunset. Text reads: The End. The screen zooms out to reveal a live-action family watching the episode on TV in bemusement. The father turns to the mother and gives her a confused look. He shakes his head, and eventually turns off the TV]


SpongeBob: [reads the newspaper while sipping a drink] Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.
Gary: [sitting at the counter] Meow.
SpongeBob: [puts on his hat] Well, time to punch that clock.[walks into his living room] But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.[calendar reads "June 21"] You are a winner.[hugs himself then looks back at the calendar and gasps] And today's the first day of summer![cut to the Krusty Krab where the bored Squidward is at the register. SpongeBob walks through the doors with a pink flower around his head. He tosses flower petals into the air]Happy first day of summer, Squidward![walks over to Squidward] Care to join me for solstice caroling?[sings in a high voice]Walking in the grass,it's so fine,don't need shoesin the summertime![tosses flower petals at Squidward]
Squidward: I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: [does a few back flips in the air] Whee-hoo! [runs over to the window]
SpongeBob: [walks up to him] Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever! [turns around] What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?
Mr. Krabs: The money!
SpongeBob: The money?
Mr. Krabs: Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!
SpongeBob: Oh.
Mr. Krabs: You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break. [sits down on a barrel and SpongeBob sits on his lap]
SpongeBob: Tell me more about summer break. [a school bell rings and all the kids run out of the school]
Mr. Krabs: Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance. [a child runs by with a full pocket of coins] Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever. [pulls down a menu] I guess that's what I like best. [puts a sticker labeled '4.99' next to the Kiddie Meal] Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal. [goes over to the front window] Come here, you little piggies!
SpongeBob: I've been taught the true meaning of summer.
Narrator: Later... [Mr. Krabs is still standing at the window with the same expression on his face]
SpongeBob: [walks up] Almost closing time, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs: What? But that's impossible. [sobs] What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children? [SpongeBob shrugs as Mr. Krabs sighs] I guess summer isn't coming this year.
SpongeBob: Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there. [points at a playground where kids are playing]
Mr. Krabs: Playground? Luring away me young customers? Warm up the boat, SpongeBob. [cut to the playground. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs pull up in their boat. They peek out using a pair of binoculars]
SpongeBob: See anything, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob. [two kids are swinging] So weak and malnourished. [one of the kids is eating a lollipop] With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing. [a kid slides down a slide] Breaks me heart. [cries] No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
Mr. Krabs: True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do. [drives off]
SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey! [cut to SpongeBob walking to the Krusty Krab] Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment. [stares at something in the distance] Huh? [a group of kids are lined up at the Krusty Krab where a sign reads "Krabby Land" is hanging. A giant sheet is covering some sort of area. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [sticks the hammer in his belt] You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!
SpongeBob: Krabby Land, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, Krabby Land! [holds up a sign] Where a kid can have fun... for the right price. [laughs] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?
Monroe: Monroe.
Mr. Krabs: Nice to meet you, Monroe. [picks him up and laughs]
Monroe: Whee!
Mr. Krabs: [shakes Monroe and hears change in his pocket] Mmm... a-ha! [his pupils become dollar signs] Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land! [the kids cheer] Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.
Kids: We promise.
Mr. Krabs: All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land! [pulls off the sheet that covered the play area]
Kids: Yeah! [kids' cheers soon turn into frowns and shocked expressions. The play area is a bunch of cheap rides that break down. Tyler tries a slide but it collapses as he tries it]
Tyler: Whoa! Ooh, where am I?
Mr. Krabs: Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability waivers! [holds up a stack of paper] Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!
Kids: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties. [holds up a Krabby Patty] Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.
Kids: We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!
SpongeBob: [while kids are chanting "We want Krabby" eight times] Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.
SpongeBob: Stall 'em? How do I do that?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. Be entertaining. [leaves]
SpongeBob: [turns around and sees the kids, angry; he laughs nervously and waves] Hey, kids!
Monroe: You're not Krabby the Clown.
SpongeBob: No, I'm not. I'm, uh... [puts on a mask] I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!
Tyler: Lame.
SpongeBob: Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles? [picks up a bubble wand]
Monroe: No.
SpongeBob: Well, you've never seen my bubbles. [blows a jellyfish bubble] Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?
Tyler: Still lame. [bubble pops]
SpongeBob: [dips wand again] Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins. [blows a seahorse bubble] Ta-da! [Tyler pops the bubble] Uh... huh.
Kids: You stink! Bring on the clown!
SpongeBob: Okay, uh... and now for a finale! [starts blowing a bubble]
Kids: Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!
SpongeBob: [the bubble pops in his eyes making it red. He screams] My eyes! [scream and trips over a barrel] Whoa! [crashes into The Pit of Doom which is actually a dumpster then swings over a tire. Lands in a pool of bowling balls then the tire lands on him. Kids start to laugh SpongeBob then begins to think...] [Inner Monologue] They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery. [Normal speech] Hey, kids, check this out. [picks up his bubble wand and dips it in the bubble soap then throws the wand away. Pours all the bubble soap in his eyes which swell up and he screams]
Kids: Woo-hoo!
SpongeBob: I got 'em right where I want 'em. [SpongeBob puts a piece of tape on his face and rips it off, revealing a portion of his face is missing and he screams]
Kids: Woo-hoo! Yeah!
SpongeBob: [lies on the ground with his tongue sticking out. A truck runs over his tongue over and over and he screams]
Kids: Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha! [SpongeBob walks up to a muscular guy and hands him some money. The muscular guy hits him with a big hammer. SpongeBob gives the thumbs up] Yeah, woo! [muscular guy smashes SpongeBob with a wrecking ball] Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gives a thumbs-up. Later, SpongeBob is tied to two poles with a muscular guy holding a can of lima beans; screams as muscular guy shoves a spoonful of lima beans in SpongeBob’s mouth. All the kids cheer]
Kids: [laughing]
SpongeBob: [being used as a ball in the two muscular guys' ping pong game] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Kids: Yay! [SpongeBob’s arms are getting stretched by two muscular guys] Yeah! [SpongeBob is in two pieces but gives two thumbs up. Cut to Mr. Krabs' office where he is counting the money he has received from the kids. SpongeBob enters his office in pieces]
SpongeBob: Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
Mr. Krabs: Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?
SpongeBob: The kids are using them as... boomerangs. [one of SpongeBob’s legs flies in and back out]
Mr. Krabs: Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!
SpongeBob: What are we gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!
SpongeBob: [hops on top of the table] Really? He's here? [bounces up and down] Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
Mr. Krabs: Get out there and tell 'em!
SpongeBob: [walks outside] Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!
Kids: Yay!
SpongeBob: Who do you want?
Kids: Krabby!
SpongeBob: When do you want him?
Kids: Now! Krabby, Krabby, Krabby! [all running up to Mr. Krabs] Krabby! Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?
Kids and SpongeBob: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: All right, here you go! [turns around with a blue nose and tie on] Hey, kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties! [laughs and walks back toward his office, leaving the children including SpongeBob shocked and puzzled] Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!
SpongeBob: I'll say you have.
Mr. Krabs: [turns around] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [frowning while almost in tears] How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, I ain't cheap! [takes off his fake nose and rubs the blue paint off it] Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.
SpongeBob: But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?
Mr. Krabs: [walks to the window] The children? I don't care about the children! [starts to climb out the window] I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose! [climbs out] Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest. [laughs]
Kid: Ahem.
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [angry children are standing behind him] Oh, hey kids. [smiles nervously] Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.
Monroe: Get him! [all the kids run after him]
SpongeBob: [inside, sounds of Mr. Krabs getting beat up by the kids is heard as SpongeBob sighs] I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.
Squidward: You mean this morning?
SpongeBob: Yeah. [a noise is heard outside]
Monroe: Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!
Kids: [money is falling from the sky] Yay! Hooray!
SpongeBob: Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.
Kids: Hooray! [a kid on top of the Krusty Krab is throwing money down]
SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.
Mr. Krabs: [is tied to poles like SpongeBob was earlier] Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff! [a muscular guy places a spoon of lima beans in front of him] No! Not that green stuff! [a lima bean truck backs up] Noooooooooo!


Squidward: [enters his bedroom in nightgown, with book, and cup of tea] Ahh, finally, the weekend is here. And this isn't just any old weekend. [gestures to "Dance Quarterly" calendar on wall] This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back? [thought bubble appears over Squidward]
SpongeBob: [in Squidward's thoughts, walking along with Patrick, both have camping gear strapped to their backs] Patrick, I'm scared! [thought bubble disappears]
Squidward: Ho-ho, that would be great! [jumps into bed] You've waited a long time for this. A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no... [laughs just like SpongeBob and imitates his goofy, big-eyed face] [hears SpongeBob's real laugh outside] What the--?! [goes outside to find SpongeBob and Patrick in a tent, complete with sleeping bags and books, the two are laughing] SpongeBob, aren't you two supposed to be camping?
SpongeBob: We are camping.
Squidward: SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house. [camera zooms out to show tent's location]
SpongeBob: Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside. [Squidward leaves; SpongeBob and Patrick pull their book back out, along with a flashlight, and begin to read and giggle]
Squidward: [pops back into tent, glaring] What do you mean, "have fun inside"?
SpongeBob: Just... have fun inside. See you tomorrow.
Squidward: Oh. Bye. [exits; SpongeBob and Patrick resume reading; Squidward enters tent again and gasps] You little sneak! I see what you're doing!
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Don't think I can't see what you're doing!
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: You're saying I can't take it!
SpongeBob: But all I...
Squidward: [holds up tentacle] AAH! You're saying I'm soft! You think your little "have fun inside" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is NEVER GONNA HAPPEN! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it! [exits tent]
SpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside.
Squidward: [pokes head back into tent, blowing SpongeBob and Patrick back with his loud voice] That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping! [runs into his house]
SpongeBob: [to Patrick] Squidward's gonna come camping with us! [both climb out of tent and giggle]
Squidward: [emerges with large camping backpack] Now you'll see how a real... ugh! [falls face forward on the ground, squished by the immense backpack] ...outdoorsman does it! [climbs out from underneath; pulls pouch from backpack] Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn. [SpongeBob takes out binoculars, Patrick a notepad and a pair of half-moon glasses; Squidward tosses pouch into the air and presses the remote, but the power fizzles and the tent appears, unassembled in a pile on the ground]
SpongeBob: That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?
Patrick: Yeah, it's all crushy-looking.
Squidward: It isn't put up yet, you idiots. [grumbles, picking up the tent and fiddling around with it and accidentally rips it] Huh?
SpongeBob: [still acting like he and Patrick are taking notes] Customization!
Patrick: GENIUS!
[Squidward beats on the tent with a wooden stick]
SpongeBob: He's tenderizing the ground!
Patrick: Of course!
[Squidward is still struggling with the tent]
SpongeBob: WRITE THAT DOWN!! WRITE THAT DOWN! [Patrick still appears to be taking notes, but there is just a tic-tac-toe game in progress on his notepad]
Squidward: [gives the pile a huge kick; it automatically becomes an assembled tent] Huh? Voila! [the perfect tent collapses to pile form again; Squidward pushes it out of the way] But what could compare to just lying out under the stars? [takes a lone blanket and places it on the ground; SpongeBob and Patrick applauds and cheers wildly vigorously] Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows. [pulls out "Marsh King" bag and pops a marshmallow into his mouth] Mmm... just like the astronauts eat.
Patrick: [has round fishbowl over his head like the helmet of an astronaut suit; imitates static noise] Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over.
SpongeBob: [also has "helmet". imitates static noise] SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over.
Patrick: [static] Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going [static]. Over.
SpongeBob: [static] SpongeBob to Patrick. [static] Me too. [Patrick and SpongeBob start to repeatedly exchange static noises. Squidward is annoyed.] SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over. [holds out Marsh King bag]
Patrick: Yummy! [takes marshmallow and crams it into his mouth, smashing his "helmet"] Patrick to SpongeBob! The deliciousness has landed!
Squidward: Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls, [holds up can so we can read its label] just as soon as I can get my can opener.
SpongeBob: But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?
Squidward: Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.
SpongeBob: But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.
Patrick: Pretty weenie!
Squidward: All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow.
[Squidward begins toasting his marshmallow lightly. Patrick, sitting across from him, sets his on fire and tries to blow on it to cool it down, but the marshmallow flies off and hits Squidward in the face. Patrick gets another marshmallow and repeats the same thing twice. After two marshmallows to the face, Squidward ducks, but the third marshmallow has a boomerang effect and hits Squidward in the back of the head]
Squidward: Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?
SpongeBob: Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one "The Campfire Song Song". ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...♪
Patrick: ♪Bum! Bum! Bum!♪
Both: [Patrick slightly behind SpongeBob in the words] ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪
SpongeBob: ♪And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong! But it'll help if you just sing along...♪
Patrick: ♪Sing another song...♪
SpongeBob: ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪ Patrick!
Patrick: ♪SONG! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E...♪
SpongeBob: Squidward! [silence] Good! ♪It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!♪ [SpongeBob smashes his ukulele like a guitar at the end of a rock show. Patrick does the same with his drum set] ♪OH, YEAH!!!♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?
Squidward: No. This is relaxing! [holds up clarinet and begins playing "Kumbaya"; SpongeBob and Patrick look alarmed]
SpongeBob: OH NO! I'll save you, Squidward!!! [picks up marshmallow and slingshots it at Squidward; it goes up his clarinet and sticks in the back of his throat; SpongeBob comes over to assist him] Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better?
Squidward: Better?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!
SpongeBob: But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear.
Squidward: [in a low, cautious tone] A sea bear? You mean like the ones that... [In an angry tone] DON'T EXIST?!
SpongeBob: What are you saying?
Squidward: There's no such thing! They're just a myth!
SpongeBob: Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real! It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer! [holds up cheesy tabloid newspaper]
Squidward: [reads cover story] "I Married a Sea Bear"?
Patrick: Yeah, and Fake Science Monthly! [holds up newspaper]
Squidward: [reads] "Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real"? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!
Patrick: Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!
SpongeBob: Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin...
Squidward: You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?
SpongeBob: Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet.
Squidward: Okay. Then what?
SpongeBob: Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast.
Patrick: Flashlights are their natural prey.
Squidward: You're kidding.
SpongeBob: Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge.
Patrick: Yeah.
Squidward:  [writes on notepad] Go on.
SpongeBob: Don't ever eat cheese.
Squidward: Sliced or cubed?
SpongeBob: [whispers with Patrick] Cubed. Sliced is fine.
Squidward: Yeah, yeah, and?
SpongeBob: Never wear a sombrero...
Patrick: ...in a goofy fashion!
SpongeBob: Or clown shoes.
Patrick: Or a hoop skirt.
SpongeBob: And never...
Patrick: Ever...
SpongeBob: Ever...
Patrick: Duh!
Both: SCREECH LIKE A CHIMPANZEE!!!
Squidward: Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off! 
Both: [huddling together, shuddering] They're horrible!
Squidward: And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger!
Both: Why?
Squidward: I don't know... [runs off and returns with a flashlight, clown shoes, hoop skirt, sombrero, and tray full of cubed cheese; a diabolical look is on his face] Just a feeling!!
SpongeBob: [horrified] No.
Squidward: Yes.
SpongeBob: No!
[Squidward begins making chimp noises] 
Squidward: U! UHUHU!
Both: SQUIDWARD, PLEASE DON'T!!! 
[Squidward continues hooting, stomping, and waving flashlight around]
Squidward: Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Patrick: SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt. [takes stick and draws circle around himself and Patrick] 
Patrick: Good thinking! [holds up another issue of Fake Science Monthly] All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack.
Squidward: [laughing] You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up? 
SpongeBob: Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion.
Squidward: Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this? [Squidward tilts his sombrero to the right, laughing, but something off-screen takes the hat and turns it upside-down instead] 
SpongeBob: No. Like that.
[camera zooms out to show the sea bear that inverted Squidward's sombrero; it looks like a giant fish with the head of a bear and claws on its fins. Squidward sees the sea bear and screams while it roars and chases him while he runs; it begins to maul (off-camera) the screaming Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick are still huddled inside their anti-sea-bear circle]
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you okay?
Squidward: [looking bruised and battered] No.
SpongeBob: Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back.
Patrick: Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once.
Squidward: Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life!
Both: No!
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
SpongeBob: Don't run! Sea bears hate that!
Squidward: Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then.
Both: NOOOOOOO!!!
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
SpongeBob: They hate limping more than running!
Squidward: Well, I guess I'll just have...
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
SpongeBob: I should have warned you about crawling.
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
Squidward: What'd I do that time?!
SpongeBob: I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you.
Patrick: Pretend to be somebody else!!!
SpongeBob: Here, draw a circle. [tosses Squidward the stick]
Squidward: Okay.
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
SpongeBob: That was an oval. It has to be a circle!
Squidward: [runs and climbs on top of SpongeBob and Patrick, who are still sitting in the circle] Move over! [the sea bear comes up to Squidward in the circle, sees it, snarls as it points a threatening claw at Squidward, and leaves] Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life! [everyone cheers "hooray"]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros.
Squidward: What attracts them?
Patrick: The sound of a sea bear attack.
[a sea rhinoceros appears, snorting]
SpongeBob: Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward?
Squidward: [nervously] Uh-huh.


[At a diner, it is raining outside. A man in a hat with a suit and tie is sitting at the bar, looking for his pen. A waitress pours him some coffee into his cup.]
Ted: Oh, no, I lost my pen.
[The Waitress takes a pen out of her hair.]
Waitress: You can borrow mine.
[She hands her pen to Ted.]
Ted: Thanks.
SpongeBob: I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.
Ted: So, anyway, thanks for the pen.
Waitress: No problem, hon.
SpongeBob: [walking on the counter] It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.
[Ted looks at his watch.]
Ted: [Whispers] I've gotta go. [flashback to Monday morning where SpongeBob is sleeping until his alarm goes off]
SpongeBob: [jumps up and throws his blanket in the air] Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. [his blanket lands on his head and he struggles to get it off] Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary! [SpongeBob puts his foot on the floor to feel around for Gary] Gary, are you there? [falls on his face. His alarm falls on his head] Ow! [stands up] Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom? [shrieks as he falls down the staircase. When he falls into the living room, his alarm clock spits him out] Gary? Gary? [hits one of his windows] Gary? [slides off the window]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast? [grabs a can of snail food then sings and dances] The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop! [pours the can into Gary's bowl] Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like. [sticks out his tongue and tastes the snail food but finds it disgusting, sound echoes from his pineapple house] Bleah! [sound echoes through the streets] Bleah! [sound echoes to the Snail Po headquarters] Bleah!
Sadie: What is it, Peterson?
Peterson: I'm not sure. I feel... a disturbance. [cuts back to SpongeBob's house where he is carrying his pants on a hanger]
SpongeBob: That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again. [looks at his watch] Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work. [spins and his pants are on his head] Ooh! [spins and his pants are in his arm] Uh oh. [spins and his pants are in the correct place but the collars are missing] All right! [walks out the door and past Patrick]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi Patrick! [he skips and sings. Scene cuts to the present at the Diner where SpongeBob skips and sings while sitting on a chair]
Waitress: Wait a minute. When exactly did you lose your identity?
Ted: Yeah, and who's Patrick?
Diner Chef: And why did you eat Snail-Po?
SpongeBob: Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab. [cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob opens the door with a food tray in his hand] Order up! [walks to the customer] One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.
Gale: Thanks, uh... [looks closely at his shirt] Oh.
SpongeBob: Is there a problem?
Gale: Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly.
SpongeBob: [laughs] While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here. [points to an empty spot on his shirt where his name tag should be] Huh? [he searches for his name tag then he hyperventilates after he realizes his name tag is missing. Squidward walks up to him]
Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!
Squidward: SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.
SpongeBob: But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it? [SpongeBob imagines a quiet bank and a bank robber bursting in wearing a mask over his head and SpongeBob's name tag]
Bank Robber: Alright! Nobody move! This is a bank robbery! Attica! [cuts back to SpongeBob who screams]
SpongeBob: I'm innocent, I tell ya! [faints then awakens and walks over to Squidward] Squidward, what happened?
Squidward: Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.
SpongeBob: Huh? [hyperventilates again]
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world? [Mr. Krabs comes out of his office]
Mr. Krabs: Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot! [SpongeBob and Squidward stare nervously at Mr. Krabs, who pulls out a big, black boot emitting toxic green fumes] This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour. [Mr. Krabs zips back into his office. SpongeBob starts hyperventilating again]
Squidward: SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.
SpongeBob: Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.
Squidward: [flattered] Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...
SpongeBob: [walks off] Cover me till I get back, okay?
Squidward: Oh, sure, sure. [chuckles] A genius? Well, how about... Hey! [cuts to SpongeBob walking down the road]
SpongeBob: Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning. [walks by Patrick]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi Patrick. [runs back to Patrick] You said hi to me this morning, right?
Patrick: As I do every morning.
SpongeBob: Well, I need you to do it again.
Patrick: That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you talking about?
Patrick: My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps!
Patrick: You lost your name tag? [hyperventilates like SpongeBob does. Scene cuts to SpongeBob poking his head out his window and Patrick standing outside his house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?
Patrick: I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say "hi", just like this morning.
SpongeBob: Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up. [climbs in bed] I sure hope this works. [pretends to go to sleep then jumps up] Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it! [blanket falls on his head which causes him to fall and his alarm clock to fall on him again] So far, so good. [falls down the staircase and lands in his living room. The alarm clock shoots him out] I don't see my name tag up here. [smacks into his window then slides off of it to Gary] Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast? [grabs a can of Snail-Po and sings] The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way. [pours the food into Gary's bowl, then tastes it] Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick. [walks by Patrick, outside, but he doesn't say anything] Patrick!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: You were supposed to say hi to me!
Patrick: Hi. [SpongeBob gets shocked]
SpongeBob: Oh. All right, let's take it from the top. [walks off]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Don't forget your line this time!
Patrick: I won't.
SpongeBob: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. [falls down the staircase, hits the window, and slides to Gary] The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah. [walks by Patrick who, again, says nothing, and SpongeBob growls in anger] Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!
Patrick: What's my motivation?
SpongeBob: [angrily] Forget the motivation! Just say hi! Ugh! [runs off. Cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Cuts again to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry. [laughs. SpongeBob walks off] I'm sorry. Let's try it again. [cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Cuts again to SpongeBob and Patrick] Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai... [laughs] Who's SpongeBoob?! I said SpongeBoob! [SpongeBob walks off] Again, again. Sorry people. [cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Then he is with Patrick, who is trying not to laugh] I've got the giggles.
SpongeBob: Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.
Patrick: Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?

SpongeBob: Hmm, let's see. [imagines what he did today in his thought bubble] I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins... [Old Man Jenkins honks his horn]

Thought SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. J.
SpongeBob: ...placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... [thought ends] and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster. [cuts to SpongeBob being thrown into a dumpster by the Krusty Krab. He laughs] Good one, guys! [tries getting up but slips into the garbage again] Whoa!
Patrick: That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.
Patrick: Well, then we'll look in the dumpster! [cuts to the dumpster outside the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Eh, what is that stench?
Patrick: That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost. [gets on all fours] Hop on, pal.
SpongeBob: [jumps in the dumpster] Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.
Patrick: I wish I had a nose.
SpongeBob: Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.
Patrick: Cannonball! [does a cannonball and jumps to the dumpster. He spits some dirt out and laughs; his teeth are filled with filth]
SpongeBob: You look over there and I'll look over here.
Patrick: Okay. [digs through the trash while throwing some on SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: I'm looking. I'm looking.
SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick!
Patrick: [digs even faster] I'm looking as fast as I can.
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick stops and turns around to see SpongeBob covered in garbage] Thank you. [Patrick pulls trash off of SpongeBob]
Patrick: Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?
SpongeBob: Have you [throws all the garbage away in anger] forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.
Patrick: Could I have another hint?
SpongeBob: [looks at the viewers and blinks twice] Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got [looks at his watch] one minute till inspection. [screams and jumps] One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time. [digs quicker]
Patrick: [notices a name tag on the back of SpongeBob's shirt] Hey, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick.
Patrick: I know where your name tag is. [SpongeBob turns around]
SpongeBob: Where?! Where?!
Patrick: Uh... I can't remember.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't have time for this! [turns back around]
Patrick: There it is!
SpongeBob: [turns around again] Where?!
Patrick: Uh... [SpongeBob becomes angry] I forgot again.
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you with me or against me?
Patrick: Could you give me a hint? [SpongeBob simply turns back around] There! I see it!
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!
Patrick: [turns around, angry] Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.
SpongeBob: My shirt backward... [looks at his clothes] What the...? [bends his head back to his back] My shirt's on backwards! [Patrick looks at him] I had my identity all along. [spins his shirt around and looks at his watch] Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick. [shakes hands with Patrick]
Patrick: [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Don't mention it, buddy. [cuts to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Fall in for inspection! All right, you two... [inspects Squidward] Hat and uniform seem to be in order. [notices a few hairs in Squidward's nose] Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.
Squidward: Hoorah.
Mr. Krabs: [moves to SpongeBob, who is stinky because of the dumpster] Okay, boy, your turn.
SpongeBob: [salutes] I think you'll find everything shipshape.
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs SpongeBob and he covers his nose because he smells bad] Ack! Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?
SpongeBob: Uh... discovery? [Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and sets him outside. Flashback ends and cuts back to the diner] And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story. [Ted yawns while the waitress checks her watch]
Waitress: Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Thanks, uh... [looks at her name tag] Betty.
Waitress: What? [looks down at her name tag] Oh, sweetie, I'm not Betty. I just borrowed her uniform while mine's at the cleaners. [SpongeBob looks at the viewers, confused]

[The scene opens up on a shot of the Krusty Krab]
Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the delicious Krabby Patty and its super-secret recipe. [Mr. Krabs appears]
Mr. Krabs: Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!
SpongeBob: [runs up] Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!
Squidward: [wakes up from behind the cash register; yawns] What's all the yelling about?
Mr. Krabs: Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula. [scene flashes back to Mr. Krabs and Plankton]
Plankton: Can I have the secret formula?
Mr. Krabs: No.
Plankton: Okay. [walks away]
Mr. Krabs: [voiceover] But he was persistent!
Plankton: [comes back] Pretty please?
Mr. Krabs: Uh-uh. [scene cuts to Plankton holding a costume behind his back]
Mr. Krabs: He used disguises! [Plankton laughs and pulls a cockroach costume over himself; Mr. Krabs squishes him] Super science! [Plankton drips a droplet of chemical into a test tube and drinks it; he is surrounded in a pink cloud and appears as a cockroach; Mr. Krabs steps on him again] Civil disobedience! [Plankton is marching, holding a picket sign that states "I am not a roach"; Mr. Krabs squashes him once more; scene cuts back to the Krusty Krab with Squidward, SpongeBob, and Mr. Krabs] And I always came out on top!
Squidward: [sarcastically] Fascinating.
Mr. Krabs: But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open! [Mr. Krabs' eyes bulge out, and he moves them right to left] You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.
Robot: [walks into the Krusty Krab, speaks in robotic voice] What a quaint restaurant. I think I will sample their wares.
SpongeBob: Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?
SpongeBob: With pleasure, sir![Runs off]
Mr. Krabs: [moves Squidward out of the way] I'll take this one. [to the robot] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?
Robot: Yes, please. I'd like an order of chili coral bits.
Mr. Krabs: [loses fake grin he had] You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?
Robot: No, thank you. [holds up dollar bill] Will this cover it?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, sure. [grabs dollar and hands the robot a paper bag] Here you go.
Robot: [takes the bag and walks toward the door; using green laser beams, it melts the doorway and walks through] Good day.
Mr. Krabs: Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good. [laughs; the dollar bill center pops open and Plankton jumps out]
Plankton: AHA!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!
Plankton: That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!
Mr. Krabs: Or what?
Plankton: ...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.
Mr. Krabs: Well, then, allow me to suggest your next move. [scene cuts to a toilet being flushed; Plankton screams in terror as he slowly gets sucked down into the toilet]
Plankton: Curse you, [scene cuts inside the water pipe with Plankton, gurgling on water] Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [he disappears into the hole]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] And now for the chaser. [scene cuts to manhole outside of the Chum Bucket; Plankton pops up out of the manhole, gasping for breath; he jumps out]
Plankton: You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands. [scene cuts to inside the Chum Bucket]
Karen: So? Tell me what happened.
Plankton: I don't want to talk about it.
Karen: Talking will make you feel better.
Plankton: Leave me alone.
Karen: That's your problem. You never let anyone in. Plankton the rock, Plankton the loner...
Plankton: And she's off, ladies and gentlemen.
Karen: You have to do everything yourself...
Karen: ...and that's why everything you try ends up like this... [Karen's screen shows Plankton laughing, about to pull a lever; Mr. Krabs crushes him] and like this... [Karen's screen shows Plankton laughing, holding a rubber duck over his head; Mr. Krabs simply smashes him again] and more recently, like this. [Karen's screen shows a toilet with a flushing noise.]
Plankton: [whimpering, starts bawling] I'm a failure!
Karen: It's not that bad! You just require a little help. Maybe some henchmen...
Plankton: Henchmen?
Karen: Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say.
Plankton: I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language! [scene cuts to a dim club with muscular tough guys playing pool; Plankton stands at the door] Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?
[Scene cuts to Plankton sitting in a wheelchair in the Chum Bucket with a cast and bandages]
Plankton: I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me.
Karen: Oh, come on. I think you're overreacting. [as Karen talks, a robotic hand comes out of a panel and pats Plankton, then crushes him] Sorry.
Plankton: That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea. [while Plankton talks, he "assembles" himself together, sticking his eye on, putting his arm in the socket, and matching his legs which are labeled "left leg" and "right leg" in their appropriate sockets] The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny! [he appears with a phone book and slams it on the ground] Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand! [scene cuts to Plankton "dialing" a number, which is him jumping on the buttons; cuts to Plankton running from the receiver of the phone to the speaker; cuts to Plankton writing a letter to a family member; cuts to Plankton running with his tongue moistening the adhesive on an envelope; cuts to Plankton in a red airplane, skywriting "CALLING ALL PLANKTON", but a fish sitting on a bench sneezes and blows away the skywriting; cuts to a montage of differently dressed Plankton] But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds! [doorbell rings] THEY'RE HERE! Welcome, brethren! [Plankton runs to the door and opens it with a big grin, which quickly fades into a look of disgust and disbelief; he sees a huge group of hick, redneck family members playing music; one of them begins to speak]
Clem: [hick drawl] Hey, look, everybody! It's cousin Plankton!
All: Yee-haw!
Plankton: I've been away from home longer than I thought. [Clem runs up and shakes Plankton's hand]
Clem: [hick drawl] Well, howdy, cousin! [Plankton stares at his hand, which is dripping after his cousin shook it]
Plankton: Uh...
Clem: It's me, Clem. O' course, you remember Zeke, Rufus, Jeke, Billy Billy Bo-Illy Bonana Fanna Fo-Filly, Doug, Enos... [Clem continues introducing the rest of the family; Plankton is crawling on the ground in exhaustion]... Fletcher McGee, Rainchild, Zeke Junior...
Plankton: Alright! I get it! ...I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home. [scene cuts to the family inside the Chum Bucket, standing in front of Karen] I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen.
Clem: [whistles from the back of the group] Golly, she sure is purdy, Sheldon.
Karen: Sheldon?!
Plankton: [annoyed] Yes, that's my first name. [Karen cracks up; Plankton keeps an angry face]
Karen: Sheldon? [laughing]
Plankton: [still has an annoyed face] Will you please-!
Karen: [still laughing] Sorry!
Plankton: All right, as I was saying... [Karen starts laughing] Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name.
Karen: [laughing] Okay, okay. I'm done. No more.
Plankton: Good. Ahem, to continue. [turns away from Karen; he doesn't see the screen that she brings down behind him; the word "SHELDON" appears on the screen] Only you can bring honor... [the family laughs; Plankton turns around to look at the screen; it is blank] ...and dignity... [the word "SHELDON" with a finger pointing at Plankton appears; the group laughs, and Plankton turns to look at the screen, which is now blank] ...back to the Plankton name. [as soon as Plankton speaks, another "SHELDON" sign appears with an arrow pointing at Plankton; he quickly turns around to look at the screen; which is now blank. Plankton is now trembling with fury; as he starts to speak, another "SHELDON" sign appears] For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for... [Plankton turns around and points at the sign] AHA! [he runs to the outlet and unplugs it] Okay, that's enough!
Karen:  Sheldon! Ha Ha! [Karen loses power; Plankton runs in front of Karen's screen]
Plankton: Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?

Family Member 1: But what's in it for us? [the family roars in agreement]
Plankton: Well, what do you want?
Family Member 2: Gawrsh. Can I get a new string for my banjo? [holds up a banjo with one string]
Family Member 3: And another boot to match this'n? [holds up foot with a boot on it]
Family Member 4: [holds up laptop] And some more memory for my laptop!
Clem: And what about root beer?
All: Root beer!?!?!
Plankton: Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink! [the group cheers] Victory, thy name is Plankton! [Plankton turns to face the cheering crowd; on his back is a note taped on with the word "Sheldon." The scene cuts to the Krusty Krab; Squidward and Mr. Krabs are at the register]
Mr. Krabs: Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for...
Plankton: [over megaphone] Attention, Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking.
Mr. Krabs: What?! [Plankton is standing outside the Krusty Krab with a megaphone]
Plankton: [over megaphone] I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab! [Mr. Krabs and Squidward run outside to Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, you and what army, bug?
Plankton: What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs! [scene pans out to show the Krusty Krab surrounded by something green]
Mr. Krabs: You planted grass?
Plankton: "Grass"?!? [Plankton laughs as his family joins him.]
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward run into the Krusty Krab with the Plankton family behind them; and a blackout, within the Krusty Krab are shaking and thudding noises, as if in a fight; scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' face] You'll never get away with it, Plankton. [Mr. Krabs is in the toilet, with only his head exposed, surrounded by Plankton]
Plankton: You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination. [laughs]
Plankton: Silence! [Plankton jumps on the flushing lever and sends Mr. Krabs spinning around] I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys? [Plankton snaps his finger and his family assembles into a giant human hand and ear; they twist the lock, figuring out the combination] That's it, a little to the left...
Mr. Krabs: Curse you, Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear! [the family opens the safe and inside is the secret formula in a bottle]
Plankton: Hot dog! [Plankton hops up the stairs to the formula] Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine! [Plankton pulls the cork from the bottle and smells it as if it were champagne; he pulls the formula out of the bottle] Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!
Family: [variously] Ahem.
Plankton: [notices his cousins annoyed by him not giving them credit] Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family. [goes back to Mr. Krabs, who is still stuck in the toilet]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.
Plankton: Begging won't help.
Mr. Krabs: I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.
Plankton: Eye.
Mr. Krabs: Eye.
Plankton: I don't care. Drum roll please! [Plankton rolls himself a snare drum roll on the snare drum, then runs to Mr. Krabs' office, where a book labeled "Recipe for a Krabby Patty" sits on Mr. Krabs' desk and cymbal crash is heard] Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good! [opens book] The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! Wait!
Plankton: [turns page] ...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!
Mr. Krabs: I'm warning ya...!
Plankton: [turns page] ...A cup of love...!
Mr. Krabs: Don't do it!
Plankton: ...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...! [turns page] ...Plankton?! [Plankton stares wide eyed at the formula and looks at Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: ...I warned ya.
Plankton: [screams while running all the way back home to the Chum Bucket]
[Back in the Krusty Krab, the book falls on the ground and the family reads the recipe and gasps; they all run screaming while Mr. Krabs laughs, except for Clem who just stands staring at the book]
Mr. Krabs: Hey. Why ain't you running?
Clem: Well, I can't read!
Mr. Krabs: Get out of here! [Clem runs away laughing goofily while Mr. Krabs gets himself out of the toilet; Squidward rubs his head and comes out of the toilet as well as he rubs his head; SpongeBob arrives]
SpongeBob: Hey, guys. Did I miss anything? [Squidward picks up the formula]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: Of course not! [He points to the Chum Bucket with his thumb] And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out. [Mr. Krabs starts laughing and hopping up and down]
Squidward: Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps and runs to his house, screaming] Curse you, Squidwaaaaaaaaard! [episode ends]



[Scene opens up in front of Nickelodeon Studios, where a security guard is standing by the gate]
French narrator: Last week, a never-before-seen episode of SpongeBob SquarePants was discovered under a desk at Nickelodeon Studios. [a large old-time crowd of excited people is shown] Now all the world is waiting in fevered anticipation to watch... [the title appears on screen] the SpongeBob SquarePants Lost Episode! [an aerial shot of the town of Encino appears] Now, to present the Lost Episode, from Encino, California, the president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate! [inside his house, Patchy is inside the shower, humming; Potty flies up]
Potty: Patchy! Patchy! The kids're here. [flushes the toilet]
Patchy: Wagh! [opens the curtain in panic] Hot! Hot! Hot! Potty, don't you know this is Patchy's private time? [looks at the camera] Oh, hello! Dahh! [covers himself with the curtain] What are you all doing here?
Potty: They're here to see the lost episode. Brawk!
Patchy: But I haven't got the lost episode because I... well, I lost it! [starts to cry]
Children: [off-screen] No, Patchy! Please! Don't say that, Patchy! Please!
Patchy: But it is! It's lost and I have no idea where it is, so it's best if you forget all about old SpongeBob. [shuts the curtain and cries loudly. cuts to a montage of SpongeBob's greatest moments]
French narrator: Remembering SpongeBob. [SpongeBob walks into the kitchen of the Krusty Krab, from "As Seen on TV"; brings it around town, from "Bubblestand"; puts a mustard checkmark on a Krabby Patty then puts it down on a bun, from "The Chaperone"; struggles with his long legs, also from "The Chaperone"; separates into two pieces then joins back together, also from "Pizza Delivery"; stands motionless in awe, also from "As Seen on TV"; struggles lifting up a bar with two teddy bears attached, from "Help Wanted"; skips outside tossing hearts in the air, from "Valentine's Day"; goes for a blue jellyfish but winds up catching himself in his net, from "Tea at the Treedome"; surfs backwards with his pants ripped then wipes out, from "Ripped Pants"; dodges a karate chop from Sandy, from "Karate Choppers"; smokes a bubble pipe, from "Grandma's Kisses"; sheds a layer of his skin, from "F.U.N."; floats around a boat completely inflated, from "Pizza Delivery"; sends a message in a bubble, from "Naughty Nautical Neighbors"; a muscular version of him chases a jellyfish, from "MuscleBob BuffPants"; lies in bed next to Squidward, from "Home Sweet Pineapple"; scrubs the inside of his head, also from "The Chaperone"; clenches onto Mrs. Puff, from "Boating School"; rocks out, from "Band Geeks"; plucks his eyebrows, yet again from "The Chaperone"; sucks on a table, from "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy"; shrinks on the stove, from "Nature Pants"; does a karate dance, also from "Karate Choppers"; blows the sand of Squidward, from "Reef Blower"; wiggles around, also from "F.U.N."; and lastly, gets shut out by Squidward, from "The Paper"; an audience applauds; cuts back to Patchy, who is sitting on the couch]
Patchy: I don't believe I lost the Lost Episode. [screws in his peg leg] I never lose anything.
Potty: What about your leg?
Patchy: Well, yeah, but...
Potty: And your eye.
Patchy: Well, the eye, I...
Potty: And your hand.
Patchy: And the h... oh, get out of here you blasted bird! [shoos Potty away] Hmm... if only I had a map to tell me where the Lost Episode is. [a screeching car sounds and a brick flies through the window and hits Patchy, who mutters gibberish and then falls over]
Potty: What is it? Brawk!
Patchy: Hey... it's a map! It's a map to the Lost Episode of SpongeBob I lost!
Potty: It's a dream come true!
Patchy: [giggles] We gotta go find it, Potty! [shouts excitedly and runs over to the door; snaps] Oh, first I'll need me treasure hunting leg. [grabs a black boot out of a bin of umbrellas and screws it on his wooden leg while limping out the door; it now functions like a normal leg] Come on, Potty! Ah! Times a-wastin'! [runs down the steps, along with Potty]
Potty: Brawk!
Patchy: [an elderly woman sits on her porch, knitting] Ten paces past Mrs. Johnson's house. [walks past the woman's house]
Mrs. Johnson: Would you boys like some cookies?
Patchy: Put 'em in a doggie bag, Mrs. Johnson. Can't right now, we're on a treasure hunt. [continues walking]
Mrs. Johnson: Okay, don't catch a cold.
Patchy: Walk five fathoms past Don's Import Store and Delicatessen. [looks up at a store by that name; walks next to a tree] Half a league to the forked tree. [looks up at a tree with plastic forks growing on it] Oh! [stands somewhere else, looking at the map] Now all that's left is... Huh?! The seven trials of Monkey Lagoon?! [lowers the map and sees a playground full of children] Merciful Neptune. Only for SpongeBob. Only for SpongeBob! [runs into the playground; rides back and forth on a small green horse and screams] Whoa! [goes up and down on a see-saw] Whoa! Whoa! [slides down a slide with his hands up; screams and hits the ground] Ow! [gets spun around on a merry-go-round and screams; he then slowly climbs on the monkey bars while a little kid punches him in the back] Ahh... Ahh... Ah! [inside a giant eye-shaped climbing frame while a group of kids laugh at him, and finally he screams while he gets pushed on the swing by a little girl, and then screams as the swing he was on returns with only a hook attached to it; the little girl stares at it, confused and then cuts to Patchy digging in the sand] We made it. We survived the trials. Oh, I'm really gonna dig this lost episode. [laughs] Dig it, get it? [laughs some more]
Potty: [covered in sand] You stink.
Patchy: And I just got out of the shower. [laughs again; sticks his shovel in the ground and hits something] Hey, Potty, I think I hit something. [camera zooms out; a large treasure chest sits in the sand] Clever, bury your treasure above the surface.
Potty: Brawk!
Patchy: [opens the chest; a golden glow shines from it] This is it! [a man in a construction hat sits in the chest, holding a VHS tape; Patchy takes it; the man cups his hands] I don't know what it means either... [slams the top of the chest on the man] ...but I got what I came for. Come on, Potty, time's a-wastin'. [runs off, jumping around and shouting excitedly again; runs into his house, still excited, and holds the VHS tape up] Yeah! Popcorn. [slams a bag of popcorn down on the table] Soda. [puts a cup of soda on the table] Pickled garlic. [puts a jar of pickled garlic down on the table, next to the other things; runs and sits down] Hurry Potty, hit the remote!
Potty: [drops an egg that hits the remote] Brawk! [the VCR turns on]
Patchy: [grabs the popcorn] This is gonna be great. [a countdown, starting at ten, appears on the screen] I can't believe it. More SpongeBob. [starts eating the popcorn; the countdown makes it's way down to five] This is so exciting! [laughs, shaking the popcorn, which flies everywhere; the countdown ends] Here it comes!
Potty: Brawk. Pipe down.
["Walk Cycles" begins on the TV screen; SpongeBob is walking down the road while techno music plays in the background; his body squishes up, then returns to normal; then, his body extends and his arms flail around; he returns to normal, then squishes up three times, shrinking smaller and smaller, in synchronization with the music; extends his body again; once again, squishes up smaller and smaller in synchronization with the music; extends his body again; starts running frantically while sweating and looking left to right; extends his body, this time with his tongue sticking out and flailing around; begins frantically running again; his limbs and body separate and his eyes pop out of his head; begins walking normally again; "Walk Cycles" ends; color bars appear on the TV, along with a beeping noise; Patchy stares blankly for a moment]
Patchy: That's it? That's the Lost Episode? That was just a bunch of cheap walk cycles!
Potty: What a rip.
Patchy: Grrrrr... [his face turns red and smoke steams out of his ears] SpongeBob betrayed us! [runs over to a wall of framed SpongeBob pictures; begins tearing them off the wall] I'm sorry I ever started this stupid fan club in the first place! [enters his SpongeBob merchandise filled room and starts throwing things everywhere] I'm gonna get rid of all my SpongeBob stuff! All of it! All of it! [rips his SpongeBob boxers out of his pants] All of it! [runs to the door] I'm gonna run away; that's what I'll do, run away! [runs out the door crying]
Potty: Sheesh, what a hothead.
Announcer: [on TV, another countdown has started at twenty-three seconds with the words "SpongeBob SquarePants Episode 118 The Real Lost Episode"] And now, the real Lost Episode.
Potty: Brawk! Patchy, come back, there's more!
Patchy: [opens the door] Really? [shuts the door, then re-enters again, quickly reversing the VHS tape what he did earlier to get his SpongeBob stuff back; sits back down] Hooray, let's watch!
["The Sponge Who Could Fly" title card appears. Opening credits also appear soon after.]
["The Sponge Who Could Fly" opens up in Jellyfish Fields]
French narrator: Here we see the proud jellyfish hunter. [SpongeBob stands completely still at the top of a hill, holding his net] He stands motionless to lure the jellyfish into a false sense of security. [a jellyfish swims right be him] And when his prey ventures to close, he springs into action.
SpongeBob: [puts on his safety glasses; turns into a spring and bounces after the jellyfish; stops in midair and looks down] Huh? [stretches out and starts falling downward, now in normal form] [screams and hits the ground] Ooh! [separates into seven smaller SpongeBob's, who all run away and then join back together, except for one, which SpongeBob catches and places in an open space on his backside; wipes the sweat off his forehead] Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish. [salutes a jellyfish that buzzes over his head] Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty. [a jellyfish floats up and down above SpongeBob's palm; music begins to play as a microphone lowers in front of him; he clears his throat] ♪If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.♪ [SpongeBob's two eyes combine into one big eye; the camera zooms into it and his pupil becomes him flying through the sky] ♪I would fly so very high and touch the sky.♪ [flies through a cloud] ♪And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly♪ [the blue sky backdrop turns back into Jellyfish Fields, and SpongeBob falls to the ground; he gets up] Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants. [a thought cloud appears above SpongeBob's head; SpongeBob's grandfather is inside of it]
Grandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly, we'd have propellers on our heads or jet engines on our backs. [the cloud disappears]
SpongeBob: [snaps] I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine! [cuts to SpongeBob working on building a plane outside of a barn; Patrick walks up to him]
Patrick: What's that contraption, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That, Patrick, is a flying machine.
Patrick: [laughs]
SpongeBob: What's so funny?
Patrick: Well, it's like my grandpa used to say. [a thought cloud appears over his head; Grandpa SquarePants is inside it again]
Grandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly... [notices Patrick] Hey, I'm not your grandfather! [pokes Patrick in the head with his cane; the thought cloud disappears]
SpongeBob: Well, here I go, Patrick! [runs to the front] I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check! [spins the propeller around] Landing gear... [kicks the tire] check! Complimentary peanuts... [holds up a bag of peanuts] check-a-roo. [hops into the cockpit, now with a hat and glasses on] Ready for takeoff! [pushes a handle forward; the plane starts up, then comes to pieces; the propeller spins through the air and slices through a grain silo next to the farm; sand pours out of it and covers him and Patrick]
Patrick: You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!
SpongeBob: Don't remind me.
Jenkins: [runs up] I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines! Now git! [Patrick and SpongeBob run away]
Patrick: We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food! [cuts to Patrick standing in front of his rock, looking dumb; SpongeBob runs up with blueprints in his hand]
SpongeBob: Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders... [blows raspberries; cuts to him standing on the top of a cliff in a rubbery bat costume] This one's gonna fly! [stretches out the wings; the camera focuses on SpongeBob's butt, which is sticking out more than ever] I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?
Patrick: [at the bottom of the cliff] Ready!
SpongeBob: [jumps and starts flapping his wings; starts gasping] It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm... [ceases to fly] falling! [hits the ground] Ooh! [Patrick runs over and sprays him with a fire extinguisher; cuts to SpongeBob, holding a clipboard, and Patrick, walking]
SpongeBob: This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly! Behold. [walks up to a lawn chair with two balloons attached to it and a brick sitting on it]
Patrick: Oh boy, a birthday party!
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three. [goes over and picks up the brick] All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and... [turns around and realizes that his invention is no longer there] Huh? [looks up and sees it flying away] Well, back to the drawing board.
Patrick: Can we have the cake now? [singing] Happy, happy birthday to you! [cuts to SpongeBob, attached to a red kite, which is attached to a bicycle that Patrick is on]
SpongeBob: Patrick, get ready to say "Eureka!"
Patrick: Okay!
SpongeBob: Go! [Patrick starts pedaling; SpongeBob lifts up off the bucket he is standing on and flies through the air] It's working! I'm flying! [flies past three fish on the side of the road]
Cap Fish: Hey! Look at that guy tied to a kite!
Fred: Why's he doing that?
Nancy: Oh my goodness...
Fred: Why's he doing that?
Cap Fish: He'll fall and break his...
Nancy: Can you see from up there?
SpongeBob: Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you. [suddenly, the kite snaps on him and falls out of the sky] D'oh! [Patrick keeps pedaling as SpongeBob repeatedly hits the ground behind him] Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! [the three fish crack up; cuts to the Barg'n-Mart; SpongeBob is standing at the cash register in front of Vendor; he puts the shredded kite on the counter] Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite.
Lou: Hey... I know you. Yeah, from today's paper! [holds up a newspaper with a picture of SpongeBob on the front page and the headline "Local Nutcase Tries to Fly"]
SpongeBob: "Local nutcase tries to fly"?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs, too!
Lou: No they didn't.
SpongeBob: [raises his fist] You'll see. [walks outside, and past Monroe and his mother]
Monroe: Look mom, it's the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom.
Mable: Wow! I wonder why he's still using his legs.
Monroe: Come on, Bird Man. Flap your wings and fly! [makes flapping motions; he and his mother laugh cruelly; SpongeBob walks away, only to encounter many other fish]
Cap Fish: Hey, Bird Man, going to check on your eggs?
Nancy: Maybe he's looking for a statue to poop on.
Fred: [steps in front of SpongeBob and starts flapping his arms and making chicken noises; a crowd of fish around him laughs]
SpongeBob: Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams! [two fish holding babies stand to the side of him]
Mother #2: You think you're the only one with unfulfilled dreams?
Stubble Fish: I was supposed to be a concert pianist... until I realized I didn't have any fingers. [looks at his hands]
Nat: We all had dreams.
Nancy: What makes you so special? [the crowd of fish turns into an angry mob, along with pitchfork and torches]
Mob: Let's get him!
SpongeBob: [the mob chases him; he starts panting, then stops] Huh? [camera zooms out to reveal SpongeBob just stepped off the edge of a cliff and he screams]
Nat: Good riddance, dreamer!
SpongeBob: [screams as he lands in a Mud Removal truck] Ooh! [the truck makes a sharp turn and SpongeBob falls out, covered in mud; while falling] Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh! [lands in a Feather Delivery truck; sticks his head up, which is now covered with feathers] I guess I spoke too soon.
French narrator: [Note: television version only] [the scene freezes] Will SpongeBob learn to fly? Stay tuned.
[fade to black.]
[Cut to SpongeBob, with a towel wrapped around his body and the top of his head, looking out the window at the jellyfish flying by]
SpongeBob: There they go again, Gary. [sighs] I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life. [takes off his towel, under which is his underwear, and tosses it away] Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true. [grabs his pants and puts them on] Back to reality. [walks over to the sink; Gary follows]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, my dreams are silly. [takes the towel off of his head; grabs a comb and blow-dryer and starts brushing and drying his spongy hair; the phone rings; he sticks the blow-dryer partially in his pants and answers the phone] Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What? [the blow-dryer starts to inflate his pants] No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Mama? Well, listen up, Joe. [Gary retreats inside his shell] I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible. [floats upward and hits the ceiling] I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary! [pulls the blow-dryer out of his pants] I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come! [the top half of his pineapple opens up and he flies out of it]
Monroe: [points] Mom, look! It's the flying guy!
Mable: Wow, I guess he wasn't a lunatic after all.
SpongeBob: [flying over the town] ♪I'm flying. I'm flying!♪
Citizens: [Cap Fish pops up] ♪He's flying!♪ [Nat pops out the window] ♪He's flying!♪ [Miss Shell pops up] ♪He's really, really flying!♪ [Nancy opens her door; Tom pops out of the sewer, moving his fingers in rhythm]
SpongeBob: ♪They laughed, they scoffed, before I had liftoff.♪
Citizens: [Miss Shell stands next to Martha holding balloons; an aqua fish stands next to another older fish; Lenny and Vendor pass by] ♪But now he's flying.♪ [SpongeBob passes over them] ♪He's flying high in the sky.♪ [Nat drives by in a boat; another fish drives behind them; a couple other fish enter the scene]
SpongeBob: ♪I'd love to hang around to say I told you so.♪ [takes off] ♪But it's off to Jellyfish Fields I go!♪ [passes by a sign pointing in the direction of the Fields, making it bobble] ♪Roads and streets are not for me.♪ [passes over an intersection with a stoplight]
Mrs. Puff: ♪Help! Please help! My snail is up a tree. I've had her since I was a little girl.♪ [takes a deep breath] ♪But now it looks like the end of her world.♪ [the tree branch holding the snail snaps off] No!
SpongeBob: [catches the snail] Gotcha! [laughs; hands the snail to Mrs. Puff] Next time, try the elevator. [flies off]
Mrs. Puff: Thank you, Bird Man!
SpongeBob: [flies upward in a circle, leaving a swirling rainbow path behind him; flies up to a plane, in which Billy is sitting, among others] ♪I have never felt so free!♪ [Billy looks out the window at SpongeBob in bewilderment] ♪High in the sky is the place for me.♪ [flies away; Billy pulls down an oxygen mask and starts breathing heavily] ♪Helping friends from up above.♪ [SpongeBob flies onward some more, still leaving a rainbow path behind him; sprinkles drop down over a group of children; Monroe sticks his tongue out and catches one, then makes a face in disgust] ♪These are the things that I love!♪ [picks up a dime off the ceiling of a building and drops it in Mr. Krabs's hand] ♪I'll help Mr. Krabs reclaim his dime.♪
Mr. Krabs: I'm rich!
[cuts to Patrick who stares in awe at a mime doing his shtick; SpongeBob swoops down and lifts him into the air]
SpongeBob: ♪And I'll save Patrick from this mime!♪
Patrick: Thanks, buddy!
SpongeBob: [flies over to a kelp bush] ♪Even Plankton needs some help, when he gets tangled in the ke-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-elllllllp!♪ [inside the bush, Plankton is struggling to untangle himself from a piece of kelp; SpongeBob lifts him up]
Plankton: Please put me down!
[cuts to the Bikini Bottom News, where Johnny is reporting]
Johnny: All of Bikini Bottom is abuzz over the identity of a mysterious flying man who helps people. [cuts to Tom, wearing a bad hairpiece]
Tom: He found my hair piece! [cuts to Tyler]
Tyler: He helps people... and he flies... and he helps people.
Fish Head: [back at the desk] Who knows what superhero act of courage he'll astound us with next?
[cuts to a foggy night at Goo Lagoon; the lighthouse is shining its light around, when suddenly, it goes out; Johnson and an old fish run up]
Nat: Oh no! The light in the Goo Lagoon lighthouse went out, and Sailor Jenkins is headed for the coastline!
Jenkins: [drives through the fog in a boat on the lagoon] I'm glad I gave up farming!
SpongeBob: [flies down] I'm coming! [takes out the old light bulb and reaches behind his back to get a new one; screws it in and flips the switch; it turns on and Sailor Jenkins turns back around; a crowd of people run up, cheering]
Nat: Thanks, mysterious flying man!
Jenkins: [slams into a large rock in the middle of the lagoon; starts to sink] I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines!
SpongeBob: [walking away, with his pants deflated, brushing his hands off] That's enough good deeds for one day. I've got a date with a flock of jellyfish.
Mr. Krabs: [runs up] SpongeBob! Son! I need you and your magical pants!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I invented these pants so I could fly with the jellyfish! If I keep doing favors for people I'll never make my dreams a reality. [starts to walk away]
Mr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, it's an emergency!
SpongeBob: [stops; inflates his pants] Let's roll! [flying through the sky with Mr. Krabs in his arms] Where to, Mr. K?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... my garage.
SpongeBob: You've got it! [lands next to Mr. Krabs' garage] What's the emergency, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure you're up for it, boy?
SpongeBob: I think my pants can handle it.
Mr. Krabs: I need you...
SpongeBob: [anxiously] Yes?
Mr. Krabs: To clean...
SpongeBob: Clean up crime?
Mr. Krabs: My garage.
SpongeBob: [his pants deflate] That's your emergency?
Mr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, everyone knows it's easier to clean a garage when you can fly!
SpongeBob: [crosses his arms] All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors! [inflates his pants again; later, he flies out of the garage, finished with the job] All done, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [sunbathing] And the recyclables?
SpongeBob: Aw, shrimp. [turns around and re-enters the garage; even later, he flies away] Finally! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!
Patrick: [off-screen] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick's in trouble.
Patrick: [lying on his back in the street] SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [flies down to him] What is it, buddy?
Patrick: Will you scratch my tummy? [SpongeBob gets annoyed but does it anyway] Ah...
[a montage begins]
Larry: Help me pick out a tie? [holds out three different colored ties; SpongeBob picks one]
Squidward: Clean my bathtub? [SpongeBob unwillingly obeys]
Mrs. Puff: Balance my checkbook? [SpongeBob scribbles in her checkbook]
Plankton: Help spread the word of evil? [SpongeBob hands out newspapers with the headline "EVIL" on them]
Hat Fish: Untangle my phone chords?
Cap Fish: Do my geometry?
Nancy: Talk to my plants.
Gray Fish: Rub my scalp? [SpongeBob rubs the man's scalp] Mmm... oh yeah!
SpongeBob: [stops and starts flailing his arms] Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm supposed to be at Jellyfish Fields right now. But instead, I'm rubbing your scalp. And I don't even know who you are.
Gray Fish: But, we went to elementary school together.
SpongeBob: Dennis? [starts rubbing his scalp again]
Dennis: Mmm... oh yeah!
[cuts to a crowd of fish searching for SpongeBob]
Cap Fish: SpongeBob!
Monroe: Hey SpongeBob!
Fred: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [hiding behind a rock] If I don't give these feverish favor-seekers the slip, I'll never get to fly with the jellyfish. [quietly flies away]
Monroe: Hey! There he is!
SpongeBob: [flies faster]
Monroe: He's getting away!
Light Purple Fish: No! He owes us favors!
Monroe: Get him! [the angry crowd chases after him, into Downtown Bikini Bottom; while SpongeBob flies past the buildings in a straight line, the crowd runs up and down each building; they stop at a cliff, before Jellyfish Fields; SpongeBob keeps flying]
SpongeBob: I'm almost at Jellyfish Fields. I'm gonna make it!
Nat: He's headed for Jellyfish Fields! We'll never catch him now!
Jenkins: [off-screen] I'll take care of this!
Crowd: It's Cannonball Jenkins!
Jenkins: [inside a lit cannon, wearing a red helmet and suit; launches out of the cannon and toward SpongeBob; he collides with him, and SpongeBob's inflatable pants explode; the two hurtle toward the ground; SpongeBob falls even further as Cannonball Jenkins opens up a red parachute] I told you nothing good would come from city folk and their flying machines! [the crowd watches as SpongeBob crashes to the ground; they walk over]
Fred: What have we done? [starts to cry] Come on, everybody! I think a proper burial is in order. [picks up the pants] A pair of pants like these come around... once in a lifetime. [the crowd leaves; SpongeBob, now in his underwear, regains consciousness]
SpongeBob: Well, it was fun while it lasted. [walks up to Jellyfish Fields, then walks away] I guess I'm not meant to fly after all. [sighs; starts to raise up in the air; a group of jellyfish are below him, carrying him up] Huh? Hey! My jellyfish friends are helping me fly! Without pants! I guess it just goes to show... [the jellyfish carry him back to Bikini Bottom] ♪You don't need a plane to fly♪ [Johnson looks out the window at him] ♪Plastic wings may make you cry♪ [a flock of scallops fly by] ♪Kites are made for windy days. Lawn chair with balloons... fly away♪ [the crowd of fish bury SpongeBob's pants as the mourn over them] ♪Inflatable pants... you may as well skip!♪ [arrives at his home; the jellyfish put him back on the ground] ♪If you want to fly, all you need... is friendship. Yeah.♪ [the jellyfish buzz away; waves] Goodbye, jellies! You taught me a valuable lesson. Although I'm not quite sure what it was.
Patrick: [walks up] Hey! Let's fly down to the pizza house for a slice.
SpongeBob: No more flying for me, Patrick. I'll leave that to the jellyfish. [opens his door]
Patrick: Suit yourself. [lifts up his arm and flies away]
SpongeBob: [turns back around] Did Patrick just...? [laughs] Nah! [enters his house again, but opens the door one last time, just to make sure.]
Patchy: Wow! Wasn't that great, kids?
Potty: Let's watch it again.
Patchy: [chuckles] That's a great idea, Potty. [looks on the table] Where's the remote? [continues searching] Where's the remote? [stands up] Oh, I lost the remote! They should make those things... [a brick flies through the window and hits Patchy on the head] Eh... [falls to the floor]
Potty: Brawk!
Patchy: [stands back up and drops the brick on his foot; he is now holding his remote] My remote! [goes to the window] Thanks, stranger!
Mrs. Johnson: [outside, in a wheelchair] Don't mention it, Patchy! [flames shoot of the back of her wheelchair and she peels off, leaving a skid mark behind]
Patchy: Now, which one of these cockamamie buttons is rewind? [presses a button; a juggling clown appears on TV] No, that's not it. [presses another button; a weatherman appears on TV] D'oh! Wrong again. [keeps flipping through the channels and grunting; a black and white horse movie comes on, then a blob movie, then a football game, then the giraffe from "Krusty Krab Training Video," then the anemone from "Your Shoe's Untied" then a Tyrannosaurus Rex battling a Triceratops; Potty flies over]
Potty: Brawk! Let me do it!
Patchy: No, get away! [the lights go out] That's the light switch! Give me that! [the lights turns back on; Patchy and Potty fight over the remote, until a mariachi band pops up from behind the couch]
Potty: Brawk! That's the mariachi band button.
Patchy: Grrrrr... I hate technology!! [continues pressing buttons on the remote] Rewind, darn you. [suddenly, the VCR starts spitting out the VHS tape]
Potty: Brawk. Failure ahoy.
Patchy: No! [tries to stop the VHS tape from spewing out] Stop! Stop! Go back, infernal machine! [gets tangled up and falls over, still struggling] Oh no! I've ruined the lost episode! Now it's lost forever!
Potty: Brawk! Lost forever!
French narrator: Oh boy, what a loser. Well, I guess the lost episode will remain lost. But, tape or no tape, as long as there are stars in the sky, SpongeBob will live on in our hearts and in our minds. [a SpongeBob constellation appears over Patchy's house] Now get lost. I mean, bye. No, really, get lost.


SpongeBob: [standing in front of the punch clock, waiting for it to reach 8:00] Wait for it... [SpongeBob gets impatient. The second hand stops a second before 8:00, shocking SpongeBob. The second hand then touches 12, becoming 8:00. SpongeBob happily punches in then jumps in the air. The scene pauses him in mid-air]
Automated Voice: On Time Percentage: 100%. [the scene starts again. Squidward walks up to the time clock]
Squidward: Another day, another migraine. [punches in] Heh, heh, mi... [scene pauses again]
Automated Voice: On Time Percentage: 12%. [the screen un-pauses]
Squidward: ...graine. Heh, heh, heh.
SpongeBob: Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?
Squidward: Yeah, great.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Aww, yeah.
Squidward: [getting annoyed] Yes!
SpongeBob: Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest. [laughs. SpongeBob walks out with a bag and a long, pointy tool] Litter. [picks up trash] Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper? [laughs] Kids these days. [another piece of trash falls to the ground next to him. He gasps and he picks up the trash] I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now. [more trash keeps falling to the ground around him and he picks them up quickly. He breathes, exhausted, as one more piece of litter falls down attached to a parachute. He gets infuriated] Where is all this litter coming from?! [SpongeBob notices someone tossing trash out of a car. SpongeBob's eyes turn to a crumpled paper falling to the ground] Not on my watch. [walks up to the car] Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.
Strangler: Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police? [police arrive]
SpongeBob: Yes. [police begin to handcuff the Strangler. They walk past him in single-file and continue cuffing him]
Squidward: How's it going, Lieutenant?
SpongeBob: Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts. [laughs] Yeah, just desserts.
Squidward: Whatever. Huh? [notices the Strangler] SpongeBob, don't you know who that is?
SpongeBob: Who?
Squidward: That's the Tattletale Strangler.
SpongeBob: Who?
Squidward: The Tattletale Strangler! [shows SpongeBob a 'WANTED' poster of the Strangler] He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in! [Strangler growls. SpongeBob and Squidward are scared]
SpongeBob: He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward? [Squidward's gone] Squidward? Squidward?
Officer Johnson: You're gonna do time, Strangler. Hard time. [SpongeBob walks up to the police]
SpongeBob: Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?
Officer Nancy: Who, Strangler?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Strangler.
Officer Nancy: Oh, yeah, he's going to jail for a long time. [Strangler draws on the back of the driver's seat headrest, and flips it to reveal an exact likeness of SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Hey, that looks like me! [Strangler growls and attacks the headrest, "killing" the SpongeBob drawing, and chuckles evilly. SpongeBob screams]
Officer Nancy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. He won't be able to strangle you.
Officer Johnson: Yeah. We got him chained up real good. He'll never get away.
Officer Nancy: Oops, not again. [Strangler is gone, with his handcuffs in his place in the car]
Officer Johnson: Yep, he got away. [SpongeBob screams then falls over]
SpongeBob: You nice officers will protect me, right?
Officer Nancy: We ain't bodyguards, kid.
Officer Johnson: Yeah, give us a call if you see him again... tattletale. [they drive off, leaving dust that makes SpongeBob cough]
SpongeBob: Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard! [runs into the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'.  When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?
SpongeBob: This would be him, Mr. Krabs. [takes out the wanted poster of The Strangler]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps in fear] The Tattletale Strangler?! [his appendages go into his body] Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you! [scene cuts to SpongeBob showing the wanted poster to people. Shows it to Larry, who turns into a real lobster on a plate, then a construction worker who pogos off on his jackhammer, and some guys at the Tough Tavern who run off, some screaming "HOLD ME! HOLD ME!", leaving SpongeBob distraught]
SpongeBob: [at the bus stop] Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard. [Strangler sits on a bench reading a newspaper]
Strangler: Bodyguard, huh? I might be able to help you out. [SpongeBob walks over]
SpongeBob: You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture. [holds up the wanted poster. The Strangler reveals himself wearing a fake mustache]
Strangler: Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough.
SpongeBob: I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty. [Strangler shows his filthy hands and laughs. Before the Strangler starts to strangle SpongeBob, a bus stops next to them and the Strangler puts his hands behind his back and smiles, as the bus drives off]
Strangler: Huh? Uh-oh. Uh, there's too many witnesses around here. [walks up to SpongeBob] Listen, kid. I could be your bodyguard. Here's my card. [Shows SpongeBob his drawn-over fake ID card]
SpongeBob: Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next? [a five cent sticker is hanging from the Strangler's fake mustache]
Strangler: Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man. [he points to an old man with a walker] Or that baby. [points to a baby in a stroller]
SpongeBob: Or that pebble. [points to a small rock on the ground] Or that stick. [points to a stick on the ground] Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium. [points to a white piece of paper]
Strangler: Huh? Uhh, that's mine. [picks it up and puts it in his pocket]
SpongeBob: Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?
Strangler: Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...
SpongeBob: We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
Strangler: Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected. [laughs as the lights grow dim] Perfect. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Yes, excellent. [laughs with the Strangler until the lights turn on again] Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.
Strangler: Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.
SpongeBob: Quick is my middle name. [scene cuts to the grocery store] Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?
Strangler: Whatever gets us to your house quicker.
SpongeBob: I'll take both! [scene cuts to 'Dry Cleaning While-U-Wait']
Dry Cleaner: Here you go, Mr. SquarePants. [he hands him his clothes]
SpongeBob: Hmmm.
Dry Cleaner: Is there something wrong?
SpongeBob: I'm not sure if these are my pants. [Strangler groans. Scene cuts to the perfume store where SpongeBob sprays some perfume on his wrist and holds it up to the Strangler] How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?
Strangler: Can we just go to your house?! [scene cuts to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Here we are. SquarePants Manor. Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.
Strangler: All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean...
SpongeBob: Protect me?
Strangler: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Don't mention it, Strangler. [gasps] I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key? [searches his pocket for the key as the Strangler gets angry]
Narrator: Twenty minutes later... [SpongeBob is still searching for his key. The Strangler gets even more angry]
SpongeBob: Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?
Strangler: Oh, forget the key! Let's climb through this window. [struggles reaching for the window] I can't reach it. Do you think you could hop up on my shoulders, kid?  [SpongeBob is wearing cleats]
SpongeBob: Sure. With these spiky cleats, anything is possible. [jumps onto the Strangler] Ya.
Strangler: Cleats?! [SpongeBob's feet land on the Strangler's eyeballs. The Strangler screams in pain] Get your feet out of my eye sockets! [SpongeBob starts tugging at his legs]
SpongeBob: I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas! [Strangler runs around in pain]
Narrator: Six hours later... [Strangler is still running around until he pulls SpongeBob's feet out of his eyes. Scene cuts to the Strangler with bandages on his eyes]
SpongeBob: Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside. [The Strangler's eyes open widely. The Strangler growls in anger and a nuclear explosion comes out of his head] There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door. [Strangler sneaks up behind SpongeBob ready to strangle him. SpongeBob opens the door and walks in] Step inside...
Strangler: [closes the door] Close the door...
SpongeBob: Well, here we are.
Strangler: I've finally got you all alone! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: I know, isn't it great? [laughs. Strangler picks up SpongeBob] Ooh.
Strangler: Now, you're gonna get yours... tattletale! [lights turn on]
All of SpongeBob's friends: Surprise! [all of SpongeBob's friends are in his house cheering. They drop a sign that says 'Congratulations, SpongeBob! 100% On Time!']
SpongeBob: A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work? [Strangler nervously places his hands behind his back] Oh, how'd you guys know?
Patrick: It's on the invitations you sent us. [holds an invitation up] Let's boogie! [everyone parties. The Strangler sits down in SpongeBob's chair. Scene cuts to the end of the party]
SpongeBob: Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest. [everyone else leaves and he walks back into the house and laughs] Ahh, alone at last.
Strangler: [wakes up] What? Huh? Huh? What? Huh? [SpongeBob closes the door] So, we're all alone now?
SpongeBob: Just you, me, and the floorboards. [Strangler and SpongeBob begin laughing again] Yeah. [there's a knock on the door. SpongeBob opens it]
All: Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: How did you guys know today is my birthday?
Patrick: We just do what the invitations say. Let's boogie some more! [everyone parties again and the Strangler walks back to SpongeBob's chair. Scene cuts to the end of the party]
SpongeBob: Thanks for coming! [closes the door. Laughs] Alone again.
Strangler: Is it true? Everybody's gone?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Strangler: No, no more parties today? You got everything you need now? Nobody's left? We're completely alone?
SpongeBob: Oh yeah.
Strangler: In that case... [laughs evilly until Patrick appears out of nowhere]
Patrick: Great parties, huh?
Strangler: Oh... sorry, Tubby, you've gotta go. [carries Patrick away]
SpongeBob: Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.
Strangler: Well, I can't take any chances. For all we know, he could be the Strangler.
Patrick: I'm the Strangler? Oh, I should've known! I gotta turn myself in! [runs and breaks through the wall]
SpongeBob: So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy.
Strangler: [growls] He's not the Strangler!
SpongeBob: He's not?
Strangler: [rips off his fake mustache] I am!
SpongeBob: Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?
Strangler: Oh, it's a fake, you idiot! I bought it at the party store! [everyone comes back inside]
Squidward: Did someone say 'party'? [Strangler screams and runs out through the wall]
Strangler: I can't take it!
SpongeBob: [runs after him] Wait, bodyguard, I need protection! [Strangler gets into a taxi]
Strangler: Step on it! I'm being chased by a maniac! [SpongeBob chases after the taxi]
SpongeBob: I'm not safe! Come back! [taxi goes to the Bikini Bottom Airport and an airplane takes off]
Strangler: Finally, away from that guy.
SpongeBob: [on the airplane a row behind Strangler] Good idea, bodyguard. They’ll never find us up here. [Strangler jumps out of the plane screaming, he opens his parachute, but it is actually SpongeBob] Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane. [Strangler takes out a giant pair of scissors and cuts the strings off the SpongeBob parachute and plummets right into the Bikini Bottom Police Station jail. SpongeBob comes running up to him] Bodyguard, bodyguard!
Strangler: Look, kid... I'm not your bodyguard! [cries] I'm the Strangler! See?! [looks toward his 'WANTED' poster on the wall]
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Strangler! [police officers walk up]
Officer Nancy: Good work, SpongeBob. You put the Strangler behind bars.
Strangler: At least I'm safe from that yellow idiot.
Patrick: Hey, Mac, [Strangler turns and sees Patrick in the cell with him] what're you in for?


[SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the Palace of Pranks.]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, here it is, the Palace of Pranks, the greatest novelty shop in Bikini Bottom. All the greatest pranksters shop here. This is where I got my gag seanut brittle can. [The scene shows a close up of the can of Seanut Brittle.]
Patrick: Oh, boy, Seanut Brittle - gimmie!
[Patrick tries to open the can.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember?
Patrick: Nice try, SquarePants, but it's not gonna work this time. I'm gonna have some of your delicious Seanut Brittle! [he opens the can and purple tubes pop out of the can] Where's the Seanut Brittle?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick. Come on, let's go inside.
[SpongeBob walks off screen.]
Patrick: [starting to cry] Seanut Brittle?
[SpongeBob enters the Palace of Pranks and smells the air.]
SpongeBob: Ah! [Patrick enters the scene.] Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items. [An aisle is shown.] Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see! [He walks down an aisle.] Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?
Patrick: [in another aisle] Hey, Seanut Brittle! [Purple tubes appear popping above the aisle that Patrick is in.] Oh, darn it, not again!
[The scene only shows SpongeBob in his aisle. SpongeBob laughs. An old fish named Frank enters the scene.]
Frank: Good to see you, SpongeBob. How's my number one customer doing?
SpongeBob: Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster, too.
Frank: [Walking up to Patrick] Well, pleasure to meet you, Patrick. [shakes Patrick's hand, but Frank has a joy buzzer, so it shocks Patrick. Patrick screams and sucks on his hand. Frank laughs.] That's your first lesson, son, the granddaddy of all pranks. The joy buzzer.
Patrick: I don't get it.
Frank: You don't have to get it. The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster.
SpongeBob: You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him.[SpongeBob and Patrick walk to the checkout counter and Frank is behind it.] Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got.
Frank: Well, this came in just this morning. [shows package of gum] Have some gum. [Patrick chews the gum but then he screams as his head explodes.] Ha! Exploding chewing gum. Only $9.95.
Patrick: [His head is gone, leaving a neck bone in the shape of a femur] I don't get it.
SpongeBob: [takes out a dollar.] What can we get for one dollar?
Frank: One dollar will get you this fake gag dollar - [He takes out a fake dollar] fool your friends into thinking you've got a real dollar.
SpongeBob: What else have you got?
[Frank holds up a whoopee cushion.]
Frank: A whoopee cushion.
SpongeBob: Nah.
[Frank holds up fake vomit.]
Frank: Fake vomit.
SpongeBob: No.
[Part of the counter is covered in real vomit.]
Frank: Real vomit?
SpongeBob: Eugghh. Don't you have anything good?
Frank: Well, there is one prank that I've been saving for a real top of the line prankster. [Shows close up of spray can] Invisible Spray!
SpongeBob: Wow, invisible spray!
Patrick: But I can see it.
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this.
[SpongeBob gives Frank some money.]
Frank: Good choice. Now be careful with that stuff, boys. It stains clothes.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Frank. [SpongeBob and Patrick walk off-screen. The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Patrick outside.] Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray.
Patrick: What are we gonna do with it?
SpongeBob: I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair.
[They both think about sitting on an invisible bench, surrounded by Nat, Tom, Tina-Fran, Horace, Halber, and Shelia.]
Nat: They're floating in midair!
Tina-Fran: How do they do that?
[The thought bubble disappears.]
Patrick: That's the ultimate prank! Good idea, SpongeBob!
[Patrick gives SpongeBob a thumbs up.]
SpongeBob: Well, let's get started.
[Patrick takes off his shorts.]
Patrick: Okay, I'm ready.
[Patrick drops his pants on the ground.]
SpongeBob: Any particular reason you took your pants off?
Patrick: Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?
SpongeBob: That it does, Patrick, that it does. Good thinking. Here, hold this a second. [Patrick takes the can of spray while SpongeBob takes off his pants. Patrick hugs the can.] Okay, Patrick, give me the can.
Patrick: I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea.
Patrick: Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!
SpongeBob: Give me that thing.
[SpongeBob grabs the can and he and Patrick wrestle over it. SpongeBob accidentally sprays their clothes and they disappear]
Patrick: Hey, the invisible spray works!
[A tour bus drives up.]
Tom: And on your right, if you look, you'll see two naked guys fighting over a can of paint!
[The passengers laugh and Tom laugh. The bus drives off. SpongeBob covers his lower half]
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!
[SpongeBob pats the ground, trying to grab the clothes. Patrick sprays SpongeBob's right hand and it disappears]
Patrick: I gotta hand it to you, SpongeBob. You look kinda funny.
[Patrick laughs and SpongeBob screams.]
SpongeBob: Righty, where are you? [Patrick laughs again.] No one messes with Righty! [He takes the spray can with his invisible hand.] We'll see how you like it! [sprays Patrick making a hole in the middle of his body] Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?
[Patrick takes the can.]
Patrick: Yeah. [He sprays SpongeBob's upper left corner.] I see what you mean.
[SpongeBob takes the spray can and sprays Patrick's lower half.]
SpongeBob: No guts, no glory! [laughs]
Narrator: Several bad puns later...
[The scene returns to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are now invisible. Patrick shakes the can.]
Patrick: Oh, hey, I think this thing is empty.
[SpongeBob grabs the can and shakes it.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no, it can't be! How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank? Thanks a lot, Patrick. You used the last of it.
[SpongeBob throws the can far away.]
Patrick: Hey, I think I found our pants. [A ripping noise is heard.] Oops! Here, these are yours.
SpongeBob: Oh, forget the pants, Patrick. Let's get home and wash this paint off.
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk off somewhere.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, do you know what time it is?
SpongeBob: Oh sure, it's...half past invisible.
Patrick: Gee, it's getting late.
[They walk up behind Nat.]
SpongeBob: Let's ask this guy. Excuse me, sir, but do you have the time?
Nat: Sure. [looks at his watch] It's, uh, ten to three.
SpongeBob: Thank you.
Nat: Don't mention it.
[Nat turns around to notice there is seemingly no one there.]
Patrick: Don't mention what?
Nat: Uh, who said that?
Patrick: Me.
Nat: AHHH! GHOSTS!
[Nat runs away from them; his eyes pop out]
Nat's eyes: Aaahhh!! [Nat's eyes jump into a car and drive away]
Patrick: Hey! I'm no ghost. The nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs.
SpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea.
Patrick: Lay it on me.
SpongeBob: Okay, we're invisible, right?
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom. Oh, it's the ultimate prank.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoo! High five!
[They give each other a high five]
SpongeBob: Let's go scare us some suckers.
[The scene changes to show Sandy's treedome. The scene then shows her reading a book in a rocking chair in her tree. She hears a noise, which is SpongeBob and Patrick's laughter. She checks to see what it is, but there is supposedly nothing there. She gets up and goes to her window.]
Sandy: Huh? [the outside of her tree is shown.] Well, that's funny. I thought I heard voices. Huh? [She walks up to a glass of juice on the floor.] I thought I left that glass of peanut juice on the table. [She walks over to a table with a lamp covered in garbage.] And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday? And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?!
[Photos of Patrick are on the walls and tables, the rug has his face on them. Sandy turns around and sees SpongeBob and Patrick covered in white sheets over their heads as they wail.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're ghoooosts.
[SpongeBob and Patrick wail again. Sandy laughs.]
Sandy: I knew it was you guys! Alright, joke's over. Take off the sheets. [She pulls off the sheets and notices there is nothing there. She gasps.] It is ghosts!
[Sandy screams. She takes out a remote with a large red button. She pressed the button and an escape pod that is in the shape of an acorn appears out of some panels. She enters the escape pod and presses a button. The escape pod flies out of her dome, above the water, past the Bikini Bottom island, and lands in Texas. The escape pod explodes in Texas. SpongeBob and Patrick leave Sandy's house, laughing.]
SpongeBob: Boy, we really scared her!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: Who's gonna be our next victim?
SpongeBob: A better question would be, "who isn't?"
[The scene changes to show Mrs. Puff's house, where she is preparing to eat a piece of cake.]
Mrs. Puff: Double-dark deep-sea light diet cake! [laughs] You will soon be mine. [Patrick and possibly SpongeBob eats/eat the cake, making it look like ghosts have eaten it. Patrick's face is covered in cake. He belches loudly and wipes it off.] Oh! [gets filled up with air and then lets it out flying all around] GHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSTS!!!!!
[Her deflated body lands on the table. The scene changes to show Squidward painting and humming to himself at his house. SpongeBob and/or Patrick takes the paintbrush, making it look like it is floating in mid air.]
Squidward: Huh?
[SpongeBob and/or Patrick paint(s) a mustache under Squidward's nose. The two wail ghostly. Squidward crashes through the wall and runs away.]
Squidward: GHOSTS!!! 
[The scene changes to show Bill surfing at Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob and Patrick surf up to Bill, making it look like a surfboard is on a wave by itself.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Speaking in ghostly voices] COWaAaBuuUUnggaAAaaAaaAA!!!
Bill: GHOSTS! AHHH!
[Bill slips off the board.]
[Gale appears waving her arms wildly.]
Gale: Ghosts!
[Fred appears with his eyes bugging out of his head.]
Fred: Ghosts!
[Lonnie appears, scared with arms on his head.]
Lonnie: Ghosts!
[Francis appears in a sort of screaming position.]
Francis: Ghosts!
[Sandals appears holding a piece of toast.]
Sandals: Toast.
[Harold appears sitting on the toilet, appearing freaked out.]
Harold: Ghosts!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are reading newspapers. SpongeBob laughs.]
SpongeBob: It's official - we're the greatest pranksters ever. The whole town thinks we're ghosts.
[Patrick is holding his newspaper upside down]
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom-- [An article is shown it reads, "Krabs Last To Be Haunted! says, 'I ain't afraid of no ghosts'"] Mr. Krabs.
[The same article is shown on Patrick's paper, but it is upside down.]
Patrick: It says he isn't scared of ghosts.
[SpongeBob is "shown"]
SpongeBob: We'll see about that!
[The scene changes to show the Krusty Krab at night. Mr. Krabs peers out of the blinds.]
Mr. Krabs: Ghosts? Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts. Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief... [grabs a handkerchief] And his dried-up sea leprechaun. [shows ashes of the sea leprechaun] And a bit of gold never hurt. [shows a gold necklace around Mr. Krabs neck that reads, "Foxy"] But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot! [his underwear is strung up with rope] Got me shivering timber brace, [shows his ankles chained together] and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down! [a strip of duct tape covers the hair. Mr. Krabs is shown wearing a barrel and a headpiece with lanterns hung on it.] And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor... and if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weapon—the specter deflector! [holds up a paddle ball] So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on! 
[The lights black turn off. SpongeBob and Patrick wail ghostly.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [As they open the front door] KraaaAAAAbBBbsss!
Mr. Krabs: Wha? 
[SpongeBob and Patrick toss over a table and barrel. They pick up a barrel and a table to make it look like they are floating.]
SpongeBob: Krabs, we've come to haunt yooOOOOuuUUUuuu!
[Mr. Krabs uses the specter detector (paddle ball) by bouncing the stringed ball back and forth from the paddle board.]
Mr. Krabs: Stay back, I'm well-armed!
[SpongeBob and Patrick moan ghostly. SpongeBob and Patrick walk by with a barrel, making it look like it is floating by. Mr. Krabs hits the ball faster.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm warning ya!
[SpongeBob and Patrick moan. SpongeBob or Patrick stops the ball. SpongeBob or Patrick then cuts the string.]
Mr. Krabs: [shivering] Ooh!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [quietly] Boo.
[Mr. Krabs breaks out of his armor and shrieks hysterically.]
Mr. Krabs: I gotta get out of here!
[He runs to the doors, but they don't open.]
SpongeBob: You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut.
[The door is held closed with a long strip of glue. The scene shows the side of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] You'll never get me!
[Mr. Krabs tries to break through the window, but instead of shattering, the window stretches like elastic and slingshots him backwards, and he crashes into a table]
Patrick: Nice try, Krabs, but we've replaced all the glass with rubber!
[Mr. Krabs dives into the toilet, but gets stuck. He pulls himself out and sits on the floor, dazed]
SpongeBob: Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets. [The toilet is stuffed with toilet paper. Mr. Krabs cowers in a corner.]
Mr. Krabs: Please, spirits, leave me be.
[Patrick laughs.]
Patrick: [while Mr. Krabs is incoherently begging for his life] We got him good, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs is incoherently begging for his life] Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea. [to Mr. Krabs] You're going to pay, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [shaking with fear] No, spirits, please! 
SpongeBob: Pay!
[a dollar floats in the air]
Mr. Krabs: No!
SpongeBob: [high-picthed] PaaAAAAyyYYyyy! [lights a match]
Mr. Krabs: NOOOO!!!!! Don't burn me dollar! [He takes a bucket of water and throws it at the dollar. The water drips on SpongeBob and Patrick, making them reappear. They laugh, not noticing they're visible.] Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick!
SpongeBob: [wiggling his arms and legs like a ghost] I know not these names of which you speak.
[Patrick looks down and notices that he is visible.]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, we're visible again. [SpongeBob looks down, then he and Patrick scream and cover their lower halves. Mr. Krabs lifts them up by the back of their necks as they try to run.]
Mr. Krabs: So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts?
SpongeBob: We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em.
[Mr. Krabs puts them down.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me. [They all laugh.] Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?
SpongeBob: Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes.
[Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened.
Patrick: Me too.
Mr. Krabs: Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now. You two pranksters better get going.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport.
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] Don't mention it.
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk into the dining area.]
SpongeBob: That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me. What a guy!
Patrick: Yeah!
[A white, round light shines on SpongeBob and Patrick. The scene pans out to show a crowd of people consisting of: Tom, Bill, Mrs. Puff, Sandy, Squidward, Horace, Harold, Nathiel Waters, the red shirt Frank, Jimmy-Gus, Sadie, Nat, Nazz-Mimi, Purple Scooter, Dennis Rechid, Martin, an anchovy, two Frankie Billys, Clay, and Franco.]
Mr. Krabs: The Krusty Krab presents: LIVE NUDE PRANKSTERS! [He is shown shining the light on them from the crow's nest] Starring the "Bikini Bottom Ghosts"!
[Nat, Sadie, Harold, Martin, Abigail Marge, and Frank are shown cheering. SpongeBob and Patrick scream while trying to cover themselves up. Mr. Krabs laughs teasingly. Sandy whistles at them as Mrs. Puff takes a picture. Squidward laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick keep trying to cover themselves.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: We should have bought the whoopee cushion!


[Open on the Krusty Krab. The customers are eating food, Mr. Krabs is painting a picture and Squidward is manning the cash register.]
Mr. Krabs: Finished! At last. [Shows the picture to Squidward and SpongeBob, who is now at the chef's window] What do you boys think of my masterpiece?
SpongeBob: [reading the sign] New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Squidward: What?! That is totally unfair!
SpongeBob: Squidward's right. That's totally unfair! Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or-- [Squidward zips up the chef's window]
Squidward: Zip it! [Mr. Krabs places the sign on the front window. He stares out of the window and notices something surprising from across the street]
Mr. Krabs: What the...?! [The Chum Bucket now displays a sign in front saying that it is "now open 23 hours"] The Chum Bucket open 23 hours?! So, that little piece of flotsam Plankton thinks he can stay open longer than me, does he? [A customer walks up to him, tray in hand]
Fish: Sure. I don't know. Why not?
Mr. Krabs: Well, he's wrong!
Fish: Oh, okay. Sure.
Mr. Krabs: As of now, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours! [SpongeBob's head bursts through the wall, in the place where the chef's window used to be]
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming. [SpongeBob exits the punctured hole in the wall and stands flat on the floor. He starts pinching himself twice, then yells in pain. He pinches himself again and yells again, then does it four more times. After a brief pause, he pinches himself yet again] Well, I'm not dreaming. [Switch to a telescope view of the front window of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs walks up to the sign and amends it to read, Open 24 hours!]
Plankton: [behind the telescope] Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me. [He starts walking into the Chum Bucket] My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula! [Laughs evilly. He notices after a while that his computer wife, Karen is not laughing with him] Why aren't you laughing?
Karen: I've heard this joke before. [Scene switches to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is standing near the cash register with a cowbell and beater in his hands]
Mr. Krabs: All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3! [The camera shows the customers of the Krusty Krab eating their food and not being swayed by Mr. Krabs' excitement] Yee haw! Day 3!
SpongeBob: [inside the kitchen, holding a Krabby patty] Krabby Patty, I don't care if we have to stay open until the day after the end of time. As long as I am with you, I am complete. [Bubbles fill the screen as the episode transitions to the outside of the Krusty Krab. It then cuts to the inside, where Mr. Krabs still is holding the cowbell]
Mr. Krabs: Day 10 of non-stop service!
Squidward: [exhausted] Mr. Krabs, can I go home yet?
Mr. Krabs: No one goes home!
Squidward: [points to the bags under his eyes] Look at these bags under my eyes; even my bags have bags! [The camera shows a closely detailed picture of Squidward's drowsy eyes, and a lady screams.]
Mr. Krabs: Quit your bellyaching, Squidward; you don't hear SpongeBob complaining, do you?
SpongeBob: [grilling hamburgers in the kitchen] ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y, says I.♪
Mr. Krabs: You could learn a few things from that boy.
Squidward: [through his teeth] Mr. Krabs, he is not normal. [SpongeBob starts kissing a Krabby Patty]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you can sit down for five minutes. Then it's back to work. [Squidward drops over and starts snoring. Plankton, wearing a tight black suit, descends from a rope on the wall and monitors at SpongeBob]
Plankton: Drats! He's not collapsing from exhaustion! But with a little more pressure, the sponge will crack like an egg [clenches fist], and I'll be there to feast on the goo of his shattered psyche. [Slurps and then does an evil laugh. Mr. Krabs notices Plankton, but since he is tiny, black and suspending from a coil, he believes Plankton is a small insect]
Mr. Krabs: Eww! A spider bug. [Mr. Krabs squishes him and the scene changes to the Chum Bucket a while later. Plankton is on the phone, ordering an item from the Krusty Krab]
Plankton: Come on! [Mr. Krabs finally picks up on the other line]
Mr. Krabs: Krusty Krab! The restaurant that never closes. Would you like to place an order? [We hear a muffled sound from Mr. Krabs' phone] 10,000 Krabby Patties?! We'll start your order right away, Mr...uh, uh...What was that name again? [Muffles coming from the phone. Mr. Krabs writes his information on a piece of paper] Uh huh...Peter Lankton. Wait a minute, this isn't some kind of prank, is it?
Plankton: Eh...no.
Mr. Krabs: Good! We'll call you when it's ready, Mr. Lankton. [Mr. Krabs bursts through the kitchen door, and starts yelling orders at SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Kick it into high gear! We've got a big order! [Clutches SpongeBob, who is staring into space] I'm counting on you, boy! I need you to raise that spatular! [SpongeBob does so, enthusiastically] Yeah! And I need you to say, "Team Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob: Team Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy! Now, make me 10,000 Krabby Patties. [SpongeBob's eyes swell up as Mr. Krabs walks away] And no breaks!
SpongeBob: [Ecstatic, giggles] Did you hear that, spatula? You, me and 10,000 Krabby Patties. And the best part? No breaks! [Pinches himself] Wow! [Cut to a view of the ocean with a small island with some palm trees in the background]
Mr. Krabs: Day 15! Give it up for day 15! [floats by as he hits the bell]
SpongeBob: ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y...♪ [floats by, flipping three of six patties on the grill, as the setting transforms into the nighttime. Plankton floats by as the setting transforms into the daytime. Plankton laughs menacingly. SpongeBob floats by, putting mustard on one of four unfinished patties]
SpongeBob: 1,322...
Mr. Krabs: Day 23! Give it up for day 23! [floats by as the setting transforms into the nighttime. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue floating by as the setting changes from day to night and vice versa]
SpongeBob: 6,654...
Mr. Krabs: Day 30!
SpongeBob: 7,121... [Plankton floats by now. He laughs menacingly. Patty items float by]
Mr. Krabs: Day...35...! [floating by as the setting transforms into the nighttime. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue floating by as the setting changes from day to night and vice versa]
SpongeBob: 8,659... [floats by]
Old Man Walker: Wait, what's going on? Whoa, whoa! [floats by, confusedly. The scene switches back to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs appears extremely tired]
Mr. Krabs: Day... [record scratch] anyone know how many days it's been? I've lost track.
Squidward: [Breathing heavily next to a pile of Krabby Patties] 43...! [Gasps, as the top of his head expands and shrinks. SpongeBob places a tray of food items on the chef's window and then shoves them off. He does the same again for a smelly boot]
Mr. Krabs: What the flimflam?! [Enters the kitchen and notices SpongeBob looking like a wreck] What are you doing in here, boy? You're wasting all me food. [SpongeBob does not answer him] Boy? [SpongeBob starts fighting the air with his spatula. Mr. Krabs hits him on the back of his head]
SpongeBob: [Drowsily] Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs. When did you get here?
Mr. Krabs: Boy, I'm worried that... [Mr. Krabs turns into a giant talking Krabby Patty] Got it?
SpongeBob: [wiping his eyes] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. Could you run that by me again?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, I said I'm worried that... [He turns into a Krabby Patty again. He turns back into himself after he stops talking]
SpongeBob: That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal: [he starts screaming and throwing his hands in the air. He hides in the corner, waving his spatula at Mr. Krabs] Stay back! I'm warning you!
Mr. Krabs: [Starts walking towards SpongeBob] All right. Now you're just acting silly. I want you to... [Mr. Krabs turns into a Krabby Patty again]
SpongeBob: No, don't eat me! I'm too chewy! [Screams and runs outside the kitchen, where his eyes bulge as he notices the customers are now Krabby Patties] Holy shrimp! They're everywhere! [Runs screaming and knocks into a Krabby Patty, falling]
Krabby Patty: [looking at him] What?
SpongeBob: [Running and screaming. He starts screaming at two Krabby Patties sitting at a table, then one going to the bathroom and then screaming and pointing at Tom.]
Sally: I told you that shirt was hideous. [SpongeBob screams again as Mr. Krabs grabs him and pulls him into the kitchen, while SpongeBob is digging his nails into the floor]
SpongeBob: No, no! I want to live! [He enters the kitchen, but bursts the door open] I want to live [He's dragged back inside. The camera shows Squidward, exhausted]
SpongeBob: [inside the kitchen] Mr. Krabs, what's going on? Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs: [patting SpongeBob's head] There, there. I'm sure it's nothing that getting back to work won't solve. Here's your Spatular. [Hands SpongeBob his spatula]
SpongeBob: [repeating] Spatular.
Mr. Krabs: [showing SpongeBob his grill] and here's the grill.
SpongeBob: [repeating] Grill.
Mr. Krabs: [Showing SpongeBob some patties in his hands] and here are some fresh Krabby... [SpongeBob starts screaming again. When Mr. Krabs pulls the patties away, SpongeBob's scream lessens. He pulls the patties out in front of him and continues pushing and pulling them forward]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, there may be a problem after all.
SpongeBob: What does this mean?
Mr Krabs: It means there's something wrong with your head. Look, I think maybe you should see a professional.
SpongeBob: Wrestler?
Mr. Krabs: No, a psychiatrist.
SpongeBob: Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist? [A paper airplane hits him in the head] Ow! [Plankton is at the chef's window and then drops down. SpongeBob starts reading the paper] Hey, look at this! "Dr. Peter Lankton: Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias". Gosh, I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. Wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see... [Mr. Krabs holds up a patty in front of SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob points and screams at it, then runs off. The scene switches to SpongeBob, paper in his hand, finding out where the psychiatric center is. SpongeBob looks up] Well, this looks like the place. [It is the Chum Bucket with the sign "Dr. P. Lankton Psychiatrist" on it. SpongeBob enters, looking for the psychiatrist] Hello? Doctor?
Plankton: Come in, Mr. SquarePants. Please have a seat on the couch. [SpongeBob sits on the couch. He turns his chair around so that we can see Plankton wearing a costume and beard] Now... [chuckles] Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head.
SpongeBob: You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink [laughs]. Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?
Plankton: Hope? Hope!? When I get my hands on that formula, there won't be any hope for any of you! [Laughs, but then clears his throat] Yeah, I mean, you'll be cured in no time.
SpongeBob: Oh, good.
Plankton: Let's start with a simple exercise.
SpongeBob: Jumping jacks?
Plankton: I want you to close your eyes. [SpongeBob lightly closes his eyes] Tighter [he closes his eyes tighter] Tighter [Tightens them even more, until the rip off] Too tight! Now, tell me what you see?
SpongeBob: I see giant Krabby Patties!
Plankton: Good, and what are they made of? [He starts recording on a voice recorder]
SpongeBob: Hatred!
Plankton: No, I mean ingredients. What are the stinking ingredients?!
SpongeBob: They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back! [He produces a grand piano from nowhere and somehow holds it threateningly in the air]
Plankton: Wait, where'd you get that piano? [SpongeBob smashes Plankton with the piano. He groans. Later, he continues his psychology] We're trying something else. I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head. Ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Plankton: Work.
SpongeBob: Work.
Plankton: Spatula.
SpongeBob: Spatula.
Plankton: Bun.
SpongeBob: Bun.
Plankton: See, the key is to say something different to what I say.
SpongeBob: Oh, okay, I've got it.
Plankton: Potato.
SpongeBob: Potahto.
Plankton: Tomato.
SpongeBob: Tomahto. [Scene switches to SpongeBob kneeling on the floor looking at various cards]
Plankton: I've laid out some words on cards here. These words are common kitchen ingredients. I want you to arrange them in any order you choose. It could be a poem or a secret formula. I don't know… oh, yes! A secret formula. Good, let's do that.
SpongeBob: Um, you're making me nervous.
Plankton: Oh, okay. [Walks to and sits on his chair] I'll be over here, then.
SpongeBob: I'm finished! [Plankton gets up and walks to SpongeBob] I've arranged them into a piano. [The piano falls on Plankton]
Plankton: Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you.
SpongeBob: Fiber?
Plankton: No, hypnosis.
SpongeBob: Hypnosis?!
Plankton: [holds a ticking watch in front of him] Now, keep your eyes on this watch. [shakes it slowly] When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3. [SpongeBob falls asleep and begins snoring very loudly] I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula. [Snaps fingers, but SpongeBob continues snoring loudly. He snaps a couple more times] Hey, wake up! [He clashes cymbals, blows a trumpet and beats on drums, but SpongeBob continues snoring, even louder than the sounds] Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious? [He holds a loud ringing cell phone up to his ear, but SpongeBob's snoring is even louder] Why won't you wake up?!
[We peer into SpongeBob's dream. In it, he is chasing jellyfish, but then gets caught in a fishnet by a huge Krabby Patty, who then eats him. Inside the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob looks around in the dark]
SpongeBob: Where am I? [Lights turn on and he is lying in his bed in his home. The door to his room opens and a huge Krabby Patty walks in]
Krabby Patty: Hey, SpongeBob. I heard your brain was sick, so I brought you this cookie pizza. [Hands SpongeBob a cookie pizza]
SpongeBob: Gee, thanks!
Krabby Patty: And here's some chocolate milk. [Hands SpongeBob a glass of chocolate milk]
SpongeBob: The king of flavored dairy drinks! [He drinks it quickly] Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again.
Krabby Patty: Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you right here [points to a part of SpongeBob's stomach] .
SpongeBob: In my heart?
Krabby Patty: Actually, in your arteries. Now, do me a favor and wake up. Wake up.
Plankton: [In real life, shouting into a loudspeaker] Wake up!
SpongeBob: [wakes up, yawning] It worked! I'm cured!
Plankton: But what about the formula?
SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work! [SpongeBob runs away, towards the Krusty Krab] Thanks for everything, doc!
Plankton: [yelling] No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work! You're still sick! Very, very sick! [Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is flipping burgers normally]
Mr. Krabs: Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can safely say, "No more 24 hour shifts", because 23 hours will be plenty! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs...! [SpongeBob then starts laughing]
Mr. Krabs: No, seriously. Get back to work!


SpongeBob: [putting the meat on the patty] Easy... [takes all the condiments and throws them in the air. They all land nicely stacked on top of the patty] Perfection!
Squidward: Is number 5's order ready yet, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now. [sniffles, starts to tear] You grew up so fast, I... [Squidward looks bored] Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this. [gives the order to Squidward] Just take it Squidward, take it away. [cries]
Squidward: Oh, brother. [into microphone] Number 5. Number 5!
SpongeBob: [shows a slip with the number 5 on it] That's me! [takes Krabby Patty and eats it] Mmm. My compliments to the chef! [laughs himself into the kitchen, where he notices something] Hello, what's this? [gets close to the window of the door where his eyes and Mr. Krabs' eyes meet]
Mr. Krabs: Come out here, boy.
SpongeBob: [walks outside] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob and drags him under the dumpster] Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole.
SpongeBob: [whispering] What's a hidey-hole?
Mr. Krabs: It's where I hide me treasure. [pushes the dumpster aside and throws SpongeBob out of the hole] Catch! [throws a treasure chest at SpongeBob] Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!
SpongeBob: What's in this thing? Treasure?
Mr. Krabs: A treasure trove of sorts. It's me memory chest from my years in the navy.
SpongeBob: Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Well, my navy buddies and I are having a reunion. And I wanted to wear me old uniform. [opens chest]
SpongeBob: Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh! [takes out a tattoo] It's me first tattoo.
SpongeBob: Neat.
Mr. Krabs: And this is me 'Manly Toughness Trophy'. [shows a trophy with an arm at the top]
SpongeBob: How'd you win that?
Mr. Krabs: By being the toughest of the tough!
SpongeBob: Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys? [pointing to a picture with 5 sailors in it]
Mr. Krabs: Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's "'Ol Iron Eye", [shows guy with iron for an eye], and "Mutton Chop", [shows guy holding a wrench], me, [shows Mr. Krabs in a navy suit], "Torpedo Belly", [shows big guy with torpedo in his belly], and "Lockjaw Jones". [shows guy with a big jaw &amp; leaning on an anchor]
SpongeBob: Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Of course! I was called "Armor Abs Krabs".
SpongeBob: You were?
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: Well, I guess you were thinner back then.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, really? [takes his navy suit] This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds. [rips navy suit while trying to put it on] Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch.
SpongeBob: You want me to punch you in the stomach?
Mr. Krabs: Not in the stomach! In me armor abs!
SpongeBob: [punches Mr Krabs in the abs, but his arm breaks into little pieces] wow, my entire arm disintegrated.
Mr. Krabs: I still got it. Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape. And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir! [opens kitchen door] Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around! [point to potatoes] To battle stations. [pouring fries into the grease fryer] All hands on deck! [puts 10 Krabby Patties on the grill] Set course for full flavor. [turns knob on stove to the right] Ketchup and mustard off the port bow. [stepping on ketchup and mustard containers] One Krabby Patty ready to set sail. [holding krabby patty up]
Mr. Krabs: No! [SpongeBob drops his Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs. [knocks once on Mr. Krabs door and it opens] Hello? Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs is shown head down on his desk] You alright? Are you sleepy? [pokes Mr. Krabs body knocking it to the floor, revealing an empty shell] Mr. Krabs! [sniffs his arm] I don't smell his pulse. [in the background, a fleshy and pink Mr. Krabs rushes past SpongeBob] What's that? [figure is behind a barrel] Is somebody there?
Mr. Krabs: Don't look at me! Leave me be!
SpongeBob: [throws barrel away] You're alive! And naked...
Mr. Krabs: [crying] It's true. I've molted.
SpongeBob: What's molted?
Mr. Krabs: It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!
SpongeBob: Wow.
Mr. Krabs: 'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this. All pink and soft and unmanly. I'm all flab and no ab! [sobs]
SpongeBob: Barnacles!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Who cares how silly, pink &amp; fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp &amp; soft you are. How... [Mr. Krabs cries] ...oops.
Mr. Krabs: I can't go anywhere ever again. Stupid, no good... [kicks shell into the wall which ricochets back at SpongeBob. He screams. The shell lands on his hand and he runs around, screaming. Then he falls over and goes in his shell]
SpongeBob: Wow, it sure is dark in here. [pokes head through the shell] Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're a genius.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not about what's on the outside. It's what's on the in...
Mr. Krabs: No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me.
SpongeBob: I get to be a navy buddy?
Mr. Krabs: Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality.
SpongeBob: Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, show me what you got.
SpongeBob: [pulls nose out to look like Mr. Krabs' then imitates his voice] Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money.
Mr. Krabs: Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad.
SpongeBob: I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.
Mr. Krabs: That's me. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story. [pulls covers over the wallet] Goodnight, wallety. [kisses the wallet]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, okay, I get the point.
SpongeBob: Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That'll do, SpongeBob.
[At the reunion]
SpongeBob: Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them! [at the reunion, a tough man is shown lifting Nancy on a treasure chest]
Mr. Krabs: [hiding in a coral plant] No you're not. Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I won't let you down, sir.
Mutton Chop: Armor Abs Krabs. Come join your navy buddies in a toast.
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Coming! [runs over to the table]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what have I done?
SpongeBob: Okay, boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here.
Mr. Krabs: I've created a monster.
Lockjaw Jones: Here's some grog. You still like pineapple, right?
SpongeBob: Like pineapple? I live in one. [everyone laughs]
Torpedo Belly: That Ol' Krabs is manly as ever.
Mr. Krabs: I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off.
Mutton Chop: Hey, Armor Abs, Ol' Iron Eye here has been itching to punch your legendary gut.
SpongeBob: Well, if you think you're man enough.
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh, this could be bad.
SpongeBob: Fire the torpedoes. [Iron Eye punches SpongeBob. He bounces around in the shell then comes up dizzy]
Mutton Chop: What do you say, Krabs? Just like old times. [SpongeBob spits out a tooth]
Lockjaw Jones: A tooth.
[SpongeBob spits out two more teeth]
Torpedo Belly: Teeth. Now, that's manly.
[SpongeBob coughs out his skeleton and everyone gasps then cheers]
Mr. Krabs: He did it.
Captain: Alright, me swabbys, it's time to award the trophy of manly toughness. To a man who's toughness has stewed the test of time. And that man is: Eugene Armor Abs Krabs! Come up here , Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: This is the best night of my life. Me naval buddies still think I'm manly. And I didn't have to shed myself.
Naval Buddies: Armor Abs! Armor Abs! Armor Abs!
SpongeBob: Thanks for the trophy, everybody. [laughs]
Naval Buddies: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
SpongeBob: I...uhh...
Mr. Krabs: Say something.
SpongeBob: Let me spin you a manly yarn.
Mr. Krabs: 'Atta boy.
SpongeBob: So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields.
Mr. Krabs: I'm doomed.
SpongeBob: Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble...
Mutton Chop: Did he say Jellyfish Fields?
Iron Eye: Blowing bubbles?
Mutton Chop: Uhh, what were you doing in Jellyfish Fields?
SpongeBob: Why, jellyfishing, of course.
Naval Buddies: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Phone call for Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob is confused] [quietly yelling] Get off the stage.
SpongeBob: Oh, well, I gotta go. Uhh, thanks. [runs off the stage]
Torpedo Belly: Where do you think you're going? Everybody knows there's two things Ol' Armor Abs Krabs would never do.
Mr. Krabs: Oh no.
Lockjaw Jones: Number one, is spend a penny.
Torpedo Belly: And the other one, is leave without giving Ol' Torpedo Belly one of your world famous steely belly butts. Haha
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean, [Mr. Krabs' voice] arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all.
Mr. Krabs: I can't watch. [SpongeBob &amp; Torpedo Belly butt each other in the belly and sends SpongeBob flying]
Torpedo Belly: Armor Abs? [SpongeBob flies into a sign and then back into Torpedo Belly breaking the shell. SpongeBob is revealed and everyone gets angry]
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville, boys, uhh, men.
Mr. Krabs: No! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am. [everyone gasps] Alright, lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable. [cries] But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: None taken, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, lad, let's go home.
Mutton Chop: Wait a minute! You've forgotten something. [hands trophy to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: I don't understand.
Mutton Chop: Admitting you lost your shell is the toughest thing I've ever seen. And, uhh, I have a confession. [rips off sideburns] These are fake! [SpongeBob &amp; Mr. Krabs gasp]
Torpedo Belly: Over here.
Mr. Krabs: You, too, Torpedo Belly?
Torpedo Belly: Actually, I had my torpedo removed long ago.
Lockjaw Jones: And these aren't the same choppers that I had in the navy.
Iron Eye: My iron eye is actually made of Formica. [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back. [both laugh]


[The episode starts with a live-action shot of Big Ben in London. As "Rule, Britannia" plays, the time on the clock changes to 9 o'clock and it starts chiming. The camera zooms out suddenly, revealing that it is only Squidward's watch.]
Squidward: Wow, I'm really late again. Maybe they'll finally fire me. [laughs as he walks into the closed front doors of the Krusty Krab] Locked?
SpongeBob: [lying in a fetal position against the front doors, knocking his head on them] This isn't happening. This isn't happening!
Squidward: Spongebob?
SpongeBob: The horror, it's unspeakable! [grabs Squidward] Don't you see, Squidward? It's closed! The Krusty Krab is closed!
Squidward: You mean I got out of bed for nothing?
SpongeBob: The doors are locked. The doors are locked and we are on the outside. Outsiders. What are we going to do, Squidward? There are Krabby Patties inside all alone. [presses his face into the glass]
Mr. Krabs: Just stand aside, lad, and let me unlock the door.
SpongeBob: [face comes out his backside] Mr. Krabs, you're here! [jumping around] Gosh, Mr. Krabs, we were worried something might have happened to you. That the world would've been deprived of the greatest food known to man.
Mr. Krabs: [drops his keys, annoyed] Oh, you made me drop me keys. Give me some space, lad. Can't a crab get a little space?!
SpongeBob: [cries] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Harsh. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [cracks his back] Arrgh, me back!
SpongeBob: Are you hurt, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [sarcastically while in pain ] No. I'm just doubled over in pain, fightin' back tears in me eyes because it's a new dance craze! [wiggles his claws from side to side like he's dancing]
SpongeBob: [naively]Oh good, I thought you were hurt.
Mr. Krabs: [shouting] I am hurt, ya idiot! [SpongeBob's lip quivers while tears form] I'm sorry I snapped at ya, laddie. It's just me back is killing me. It's me old, lumpy mattress. It's like trying to sleep on broken coral. I'm going out of me mind. [back breaks again] Oh, me back.
SpongeBob: Poor Mr. Krabs. What are we going to do, Squidward?
Squidward: Why do anything? I like the new Mr. Krabs. He yells at you more. [laughs]
SpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward.
Squidward: So am I.
SpongeBob: We should get Mr. Krabs a new mattress and surprise him with it as a gift. Then we'll never have to be late to work again.
Squidward: What? You want me to spend my hard earned money on my richer than me skin flint boss? No, thank you. [enters Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: That's okay, Squidward, you'll warm up to the idea. [later] Thanks for coming with me, Patrick.
Patrick: No problem, buddy. I always wanted to go to a mattress store. [both enter store and gasp]
SpongeBob: I've never seen so many mattresses.
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: How many do you think there are?
Patrick: [looks around and thinks] 10.
SpongeBob: Cool.
Employee: There's plenty more than that. Try them out. Find one you like.
[SpongeBob jumps on a mattress, but Patrick shakes his head. Patrick lays down on a mattress, but sinks into it as SpongeBob shakes his head. SpongeBob falls on his back on a rock-hard mattress. Patrick sits in a racecar bed then a crashing sound is heard. SpongeBob sits on a bed with a bunch of needles and the employee holds up a first-aid kit. Finally, Patrick sits on a mattress that rotates in rolling from side to side. Now back at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing.]
Squidward: What are you morons doing?
SpongeBob: Making a card for Mr. Krabs. To go with his new mattress.
Squidward: Oh, I see. You're just kissing up to the boss to make me look bad. Well, I won't stand for it. Gimme that card. [signs card] Trying to outsmart me, will ya? [licks envelope] There, I signed it for all of us.
Patrick: Hey, you didn't even help pay.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's okay, as long as Mr. Krabs is happy. [later at Mr. Krabs' house]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, me back. Well, here goes another useless attempt to sleep on me mount less, lumpy mattress. [lays on his mattress] Huh, that's queer. Me mattress seems strangely cozy and butter-like... [falls asleep]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Surprise!
Mr. Krabs: Armageddon! What? Oh, you? What in the blue eye scallop are you doing in me bedroom?
SpongeBob: We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress.
Squidward: So I suggested we get you a new one.
Patrick: [talking to SpongeBob] I thought it was your idea.
Mr. Krabs: [through gritted teeth] So, where's me old mattress then? [fury goes up]
Squidward: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I took care of that personally, too. I had it hauled away to the dump.
Mr. Krabs: [jumps on Squidward] All my money was in that mattress!
Squidward: What?! Haven't you ever heard of a bank?!
Mr. Krabs: No! [walks backward, hits his lamp and trashes some books]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: No! [faints]
Patrick: And we got you a card.
Mr. Krabs: [lifts one eye up off the floor] Is there money in it?
Patrick: [shakes the envelope] Nope. [Mr. Krabs faints again. Later, at the hospital]
SpongeBob: Is it serious, doctor? Will Mr. Krabs be alright?
Doctor: Mr. Krabs is in a cash-coma. Only the return of his money can save his life.
Squidward: It was SpongeBob's fault! Getting Mr. Krabs a new mattress was his idea!
Patrick: [firmly] I knew it!
Police Officer: Not so fast! [holds up get well card] This card says "This was all my idea. Love, Squidward." If Mr. Krabs doesn't pull through, you're going to jail.
Squidward: [gets really angry at SpongeBob] Ooh... you did this, SquarePants! If you don't get Mr. Krabs' mattress back from the dump, I am going to murd... [officer clears his throat] ...[nervously] help you do it myself.
Patrick: Wow, he really does care. [later at the dump]
Patrick: What a dump.
SpongeBob: We gotta get in there, Squidward. Mr. Krabs is counting on us.
Patrick: [looks through the gate] Hey, SpongeBob, isn't that the mattress over there?
SpongeBob: Terrific, Patrick, you found it!
Squidward: What? Where? Lemme see. Where?
SpongeBob: Over there, Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm.
Squidward: Oh, that figures. [later at the hospital]
Doctor: Oh no, this is horrible.
Nurse: What is it, doctor?
Doctor: This man has no insurance.
Nurse: He'll never be able to afford this room!
Doctor: You're right, nurse. Extract the patient to the hallway. Stat! [Mr. Krabs is pushed into a snack machine while he groans]
SpongeBob: Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress, alright. Let's go get it.
Squidward: Okay, here's the plan: you two quietly go in there, remove the mattress out from the guard worm without... waking... the worm.
Patrick: [confused] Why not?
SpongeBob: [frankly] Because that would be rude, Patrick.
Squidward: And nothing's meaner than a junkyard worm. He'll eat you alive!
[SpongeBob and Patrick get scared at hearing this revelation]
Patrick: [crossly] Hey, wait a minute, what are you gonna do?
Squidward: [lying] Oh, I've got the most important job. I'm going to keep watch to make sure it's safe.
Patrick: [naïvely] Gee, thanks, buddy.
Squidward: My pleasure. Now let's get a move on. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [Patrick climbs the fence] Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick? You can see everything from up here.
Patrick: Wow. [both sigh]
Squidward: [angry] What are you morons doing?
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here.
Patrick: Where? I can't see them. [fence flips around to where Squidward is inside and SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are outside.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow. [both laugh]
Patrick: Let's do it again. [SpongeBob and Patrick continue laughing]
Squidward: What did you idiots do?!
Patrick: Squidward, what are you doing in there? You were suppose to keep watch!
SpongeBob: Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm, too!
Squidward: I didn't do it! You blockheads woke... [the guard worm emerges from behind Squidward growling] the... worm. [screams in pain as the worm attacks him while Patrick and SpongeBob are horrified at the sight. Later at the hospital]
Doctor #2: Doctor?
Doctor #1: Yes, doctor?
Doctor #2: Regarding your patient, doctor. I have come to this conclusion.
Doctor #1: Yes, go on.
Doctor #2: We have to surgically remove him out from in front of the candy machine so I can get to the nutty nut bar.
Doctor #1: Of course. Nurse?
Nurse: I'm on it. [wheels Mr. Krabs outside the hospital while he groans again. Later at the dump]
SpongeBob: [climbing down a rope with Patrick to get inside the gate] Worm-bait to the retriever. Worm bait to the retriever. We're in. Out.
Squidward: Retriever to worm bait, stay in. Don't go out.
SpongeBob: Understood. Out.
Squidward: No! In! Out.
SpongeBob: Understood. Out.
Squidward: Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?
SpongeBob: Affirmative.
Squidward: Good. Then make lots of noise to draw the guard worm away from the mattress so I can retrieve it.
SpongeBob: Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'.
Patrick: Why are we called 'Worm-bait?'
SpongeBob: I dunno. [ululating with Patrick] Great idea, Patrick! [they both use pots and pans to make loud noises that draw the guard worm away]
Squidward: And my perfect plan falls into place. [laughs]
Patrick: [continues ululating with SpongeBob] Uh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: I think I know why our code name is "Worm-bait". [guard worm rushes up and growls at them both]
SpongeBob: Nice worm. Good, kind, gentle worm! [worm's eyes turn into an image of the wooden spoon. Then, he behaves like a good dog wanting to play]
Patrick: Ohh, SpongeBob, he likes your wooden spoon.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob raises the spoon then lowers the spoon as the worm's eyes follow where the spoon is] Wow, I think you're right, Patrick.
Patrick: [clapping] See if he plays catch.
SpongeBob: Okay, see the stick, boy? [throws spoon] Go get it, boy! [worm chases after spoon]
Squidward: Coast is clear. Squiddy, you are a genius. [wooden spoon hits Squidward in the head] Ouch. What the...? Hey, I needed a wooden spoon. I'll just keep it safe from harm in my back pocket. [places spoon in back pocket] And now for the mattress. [worm bites Squidward in the butt] I should've guessed. [worm attacks Squidward again. Back at the hospital]
Administrator Flotsam: Excuse me, doctor.
Doctor: Administrator Flotsam, what can I do for you?
Administrator Flotsam: It has come to my attention that your patient, Mr. Krabs, is outside on the front sidewalk.
Doctor: Yes, yes he is.
Administrator Flotsam: What were you thinking, man? We're trying to run a business. We can't leave patients on the sidewalk.
Doctor: Not to worry. Nurse!
Nurse: I'm on it. [pushes Mr. Krabs away from the hospital and down a hill. Back at the dump, dawn is breaking]
Squidward: Alright, you two, what's the holdup?
SpongeBob: We feel silly.
Squidward: Come on, do it for old man Krabs.
SpongeBob: Okay. [SpongeBob and Patrick jump out of the portable potty in steak costumes] Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?
Squidward: Sure, but first, put on this cologne.
SpongeBob: [reads label] Steak sauce? [shrugs his shoulders and puts the sauces on his body]
Squidward: Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts. You go in there and yell "Trick or treat!" The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress.
Patrick: Gimme that cologne. [Patrick puts the sauce on his body]
Squidward: Now get in there!
SpongeBob: Happy Halloween, Squidward!
Squidward: I am not going to get hurt this time. [hears some rattling in the distance. It's Mr. Krabs on his hospital bed rolling down the street into the dump] Isn't that Mr. Krabs? [screams as Mr. Krabs runs over Squidward, crashes through the gate, and runs into a rock, causing the bed to flip him over in front of his mattress. Guard worm growls]
Patrick: That guard worm doesn't look very happy.
SpongeBob: Run, Mr. Krabs! Run like you're not in a coma!
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs around and recovers] It's... me money! [guard worm snarls as Mr. Krabs roars like a lion and sends the worm into the air and off the mattress] Oh, money. I promise I'll never leave you alone again.
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs jumps on his mattress and barks ferociously] No, Mr. Krabs, it's us!
Patrick: Trick or treat.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I didn't recognize you. Say, why are you two dressed as meat?
SpongeBob: Not just meat, we're choice cuts! Right, Squidward?
Squidward: Oh, I give up. [guard worm lands in Squidward's arms snarling at him. Squidward runs off as the worm chases him] Ahhh! Get away!


[Open on the Chum Bucket. A clam crows like a rooster. Cut to a close-up of Plankton's face. He has his eye closed, and then slowly opens it to show its veins.]
Plankton: [drearily] And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty. [Gets up and walks to his computer wife, Karen]
Karen: Maybe today will be the day?
Plankton: Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife. [Walks towards the doors of the Chum Bucket]
Karen: Do you even have a plan?
Plankton: Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen? [Bubbles rise, transitions to the Krusty Krab. Plankton walks through the door] I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula... [He slips and falls into a puddle of water]
SpongeBob: Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there. [Plankton tries to get up]
Mr. Krabs: [Walks towards them] Look at you, Plankton. Once again, you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula. [he holds a Krabby Patty in front of his face] Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula. [Plankton tries to bite it, but Mr. Krabs takes it away] And you never will! [laughs] How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure? [he walks away laughing, two customers are watching]
Charlie: [talking to the Nat Peterson next to him, commenting on the wet floor SpongeBob was mopping] There really should be a "Wet Floor" sign.
Nat Peterson: Yeah, if that were me who slipped, I'd sue old man Krabs for all he's got.
Plankton: Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?
Charlie: Of course.
Plankton: [ponders the thought and then falls back and pretends to be injured] Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering.
Mr. Krabs: [bursting through his office's door] Sue?!
Female Customer #1: Oh, that looks bad.
Dennis: Uh-oh.
Nazz: Poor little man.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs enter the frame and look at each other. Transition to ambulance workers pushing Plankton on a gurney]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?
Plankton: Well... if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence.
Mr. Krabs: Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!
Plankton: [laughs menacingly, then points at Mr. Krabs] See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean... [stops pointing] Oh, the pain! The deep-frying pain! [The ambulance workers carry the gurney off and the scene transitions to the inside of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is pacing back and forth, with Squidward and SpongeBob near him]
Mr. Krabs: I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands.
Mr. Krabs: What I really need is a good lawyer.
Richard: Hello, did somebody say "lawyer"? [Holds out his business card] Richard A. Bottomfeeder, Attorney at Law. I couldn't help but notice that despicable display.
Mr. Krabs: So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?
Richard: Actually, I won't charge you a dime unless we win.
[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into American dollar signs]
Richard: In fact, I think we should counter sue for everything Plankton owns.
[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into gold bars. The weight on them makes him fall over]
Richard: [points at Mr. Krabs] Does that happen a lot?
SpongeBob: No, they're usually silver.
[Scene transitions to SpongeBob strolling into Mr. Krabs' office, humming his own credits theme song]
SpongeBob: Um, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What is it, lad?
SpongeBob: I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it.
Mr. Krabs: Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a... [Richard whispers into his ear] of a liability than an asset.
SpongeBob: But I...
Mr. Krabs: Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places. [The lawyer grabs his briefcase and walks outside the door with it]
Richard: Oh, this is going to be a slam-dunk! [he slips and falls on the floor]
SpongeBob: Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!
Richard: [weakly] Wracked...with pain...can't move.
SpongeBob: But what about Mr. Krabs' case?
Richard: Looks like you're going to have to handle this one, son.
SpongeBob: But, I'm a...a liability.
Richard: Everything you need to win... [a part of his body snaps] is in this here case. [shows SpongeBob his briefcase]
SpongeBob: [swipes the case from him] Really? Everything?
Richard: Uh huh. Everything but a suit. [he falls unconscious]
SpongeBob: A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit.
[Scene changes to the Bikini Bottom Court House. Plankton in a wheelchair enters the courtroom and precedes to Mr. Krabs]
Plankton: [whispering] I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula.
Mr. Krabs: [yelling] Never, you little runt! [The court audience gasps]
Plankton: [dramatically] Oww, oww! My wittle arm! [audience gasps]
Mr. Krabs: What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him.
Plankton: Oww! My other arm! [audience gasps]
Mr. Krabs: He's lying! Bah!
[Judge's gavel knocks and the two proceed to their desk]
Tom: Court will come to order. The Honorable Judge Stickleback presiding.
Stickleback: Mr. Krabs, where is your attorney?
Mr. Krabs: [hesitantly] I don't know where he could be.
[The courtroom door bursts open, with SpongeBob standing there in a gray suit, similar to the previous lawyer's]
SpongeBob: Here I am!
Stickleback: Thank you for joining us, Mr...uhh...
SpongeBob: [placing his briefcase on the desk] SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor.
Mr. Krabs: [Through his teeth] What are you doing here, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here [rubs his briefcase] .
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: Yep, right in here. [tries to unlock the briefcase, but he can't]
Mr. Krabs: Is there a problem?
SpongeBob: Umm... your lawyer didn't give me the combination.
Lawyer: Is the plaintiff ready to proceed?
Plankton: Yes, your honor. I'll try. [Moves his wheelchair to the jury box. He "owws" in pain on the way there] I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today. [starts crying] I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell.
[SpongeBob tries to split the briefcase in half, but splits himself. Mr. Krabs leans over]
Mr. Krabs: Pull yourself together, boy.
Plankton: Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: How's it coming, lad?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case. [takes a kitchen knife and tries to pry open the briefcase]
Plankton: Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor [SpongeBob continues with the knife] that had been intentionally [the knife shoots him to the light on the roof] covered with a viscous fluid.
[SpongeBob puts a lamp shade on his head]
SpongeBob: Bombs away! [he drops onto the briefcase like a bomb, but nothing happens. SpongeBob drops off the desk and onto the floor]
Plankton: Ahem! Are you quite finished?
SpongeBob: [nods] Mm-hmm.
Plankton: Now where was I? Oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed. [he cries] I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram! Sorry! [the audience begin to cry] Thank you for your kind attention. [he turns around and, softly] Suckers.
Stickleback: Does the defense... [sniffles] have an opening statement?
SpongeBob: Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!
[transitions to Mr. Krabs on the stand]
Plankton: [presents a "wet floor" sign to Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?
Mr. Krabs: It's a "wet floor" sign.
Plankton: Do you own one?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't. [everyone gasps] No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed... superfluous.
Court Audience: Guilty. Guilty, guilty, guilty.
Plankton: No more questions.
[SpongeBob tries using a screwdriver to open the case]
Stickleback: Your witness, Mr. LawyerPants.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Stickleback: Sometime today, Mr. Pants.
SpongeBob: May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap [Mr. Krabs starts sweating], miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar [takes out a dollar] and dropped it in the blender? [drops the dollar in a blender] [Mr. Krabs gasps. SpongeBob presses the "obliterate" button on the blender. The dollar starts to be shredded]
Mr. Krabs: No! No-no! No! [runs and grabs the blender. He starts grabbing the piece of shredded dollar from the air] Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here. [the jury talks amongst themselves and SpongeBob tries to look innocent] A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain. [he walks off, but then walks back to pick up a stranded piece of dollar] Daddy didn't forget ya.
Stickleback: Does the defense have any witness to call?
SpongeBob: Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand.
Mr. Krabs: [rests in his chair] Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee. [Squidward is up in the stand]
SpongeBob: Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with that ludicrous statement?
Squidward: Yes.
Mr. Krabs: What?!
SpongeBob: Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?
Squidward: Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying? [the jury talks amongst themselves]
Mr. Krabs: [looking scared, he starts taking a nail and hammer and tries to open the briefcase] Must...open...case.
[transition to SpongeBob questioning something else]
SpongeBob: So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it? [he's questioning the mop he was using, it doesn't speak]
SpongeBob: Answer the question! [the jury look at each other questioningly] Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?
Mr. Krabs: I'm doomed.
[Transition to SpongeBob still trying to open the briefcase]
Mr. Krabs: You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you! We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case. [he hits the case. The case then opens up] It's open! [they lift the case]
Mr. Krabs: It's... [shows that the thing inside the briefcase is a Krabby Patty] It's just his lunch. Or is it? [a light bulb moves out of SpongeBob's head and starts glowing]
SpongeBob: Defense calls Plankton to the stand. [Plankton looks surprised; later, on the stand]
SpongeBob: Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?
Plankton: To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?
SpongeBob: Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these? [he shows Plankton a Krabby Patty. Plankton starts licking his lips] Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty...
Plankton: [continuously sweating] Uhh...uhh...uhh [he tries to bite the sandwich, but SpongeBob takes it away. He takes off his fake casts] I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme! [jumps for the sandwich and grabs it, then he runs off with it] Yippee! Finally it's mine!
Mr. Krabs: [grabbing the sandwich from Plankton] I'll take that!
Plankton: Huh? No, no, no!
Mr. Krabs: Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp. [he eats the Krabby Patty]
Plankton: No, no, no, no!
Stickleback: [bangs gavel] Has the jury reached a verdict?
Tom: We have, your honor. We find the defendant not guilty...but he is cheap.
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning.
SpongeBob: That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present.
Mr. Krabs: A present? For me?
SpongeBob: Close your eyes and hold out your hand. [Mr. Krabs does so. SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs a "wet floor" sign with many nails in it. Mr. Krabs grabs it and starts yelling in pain] It's a "wet floor" sign. I made it myself.
Mr. Krabs: Well, it'll do. After all, it's free!


[SpongeBob is carrying a big sack of snail food.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary.
Patrick: How is Gary?
SpongeBob: He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy.
Patrick: Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you...something important. Oh, I remember. Uh... [SpongeBob is gone] Who was I talking to?
SpongeBob: [puts the bag of snail food down and notices a piece of paper on the door] Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. "Dear Sir or Ma'am... [goes inside] We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience." [doorbell rings] Hello? [gasps] My package. Whoopee! [takes it inside while leaving the bag of snail food outside] Oh, let's see what we got here. [cuts it open] My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah! [grunts] What's this? "Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row." Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge. [takes the ball and hits it on the paddle, but it comes back and hits him in the eye] Darn it. [Tries again; results are the same] Darn it. [this happens again] Darn it.
Gary: [goes into the kitchen and sees that his food bowl is empty. He checks the time and it is snack time] Meow.
SpongeBob: [paddleball hits him in the eye again] Darn it.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What was that?
Gary: [louder] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me. [when he tries the paddleball again, Gary interrupts]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble. [when he lifts his paddleball up, Gary is attached to it]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion. [Dirty Bubble on the box laughs] Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it. [Gary slithers off] Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying. [Gary jumps on SpongeBob's face, making him run around and scream] Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get! [throws him away and grunts] And leave your master to his important affairs. [Gary rolls into his bowl and sees a crumb of food left. A bunch of spiders crawl out of it. Gary packs his things] Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers.
Gary: Meow. [Gary slithers off away, down a river, and takes a bus out of town. Cut to next day]
Patrick: [drinks his coffee, then eats the cup] I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him. [knocks on the door, then notices the bag of snail food on the ground] That's strange... Usually, I knock on the with this hand. [walks in] Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Oh, darn it. Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob? [opens the door to the galley to SpongeBob lying on the ground]
SpongeBob: Darn it. Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob, what happened? [runs over to a picture of a Krabby Patty on the wall] This picture is crooked. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [looks at the paddle] Darn it.
Patrick: Snap out of it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I...
Patrick: What is it, buddy? You can tell me.
SpongeBob: I took the Dirty Bubble challenge.
Patrick: You what?! [cries]
SpongeBob: Why are you crying, Patrick?
Patrick: Because... many years ago, I took that challenge.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: What happened?
Patrick: I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me.
SpongeBob: You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk—that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat. Fresh seahorse milk.
Patrick: Thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob: Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important? [trips over Gary's bowl] Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary. [gets the bag of snail food outside] That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours. [brings it in and pours it in Gary's bowl] Gary! Dinner! [takes out a triangle] Come on, Gary, soup's on. [rings it] Gary? Hey, Pat?
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?
Patrick: About a week.
SpongeBob: A week? Are you sure?
Patrick: Hmmm... well... [pours the glass of milk upside down. The milk is revealed to be solid, which falls like jelly. Sniffs the jelly. Starts eating the solid milk, analyzing the taste closely. Makes a sour face after tasting the overly sour taste.] Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.
SpongeBob: Ten days? Gary! [searches all over the house for Gary] Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick!
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: [his eyes fill up with tears as his lip quivers] I can't find Gary.
Gary: [is slithering across the sand. Echoing howls are heard. Gary looks at his stomach and it's howling at him. Gary sneezes] Meow.
SpongeBob: This never fails. Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.
Patrick: Eight?
SpongeBob: Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it. [Patrick shakes it, but it makes no noise] Let me see that. [SpongeBob tries it, but it still makes no noise] Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new... [Patrick belches. SpongeBob shakes his belly and Patrick laughs]
Patrick: I only tasted six types of sediment. [cut to nighttime where SpongeBob and Patrick are searching for Gary. Patrick is shaking his belly]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here? [lifts a flower up] Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh. [jiggles his belly]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself? [SpongeBob and Patrick open Squidward's door while he is in the bathtub] [screams three times and pants]
SpongeBob: You check over there. I'll check in here. [checks in the bathtub Squidward is in] Find him yet, Pat?
Patrick: [pulls the sink out from the wall, making water shoot out everywhere] No, but I'll keep looking.
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] But there's nowhere left to look.
Patrick: There's one place we haven't checked. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in front of the former's mailbox full of letters]
SpongeBob: I doubt Gary could fit in there.
Patrick: Can't hurt to look.
SpongeBob: Here goes nothing. [opens the mailbox and a bunch of letters shoot out and a rolled up paper falls on the ground] Look, Pat!
Patrick: What is it?
SpongeBob: Let's see. "Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me." Dear Neptune, what have I done?
Patrick: What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there.
SpongeBob: Gary. [cut to Gary slithering into another town. A couple walks by him laughing, then sees Fred and Debbie Rechid eating inside a diner]
Fred: Are my pants too tight, dear? [takes a bite out of his burger, then notices Gary outside and closes the blinds on the window as they both laugh. Gary slithers along more until he stops and sees some nachos in an alleyway. When he is about to take a bite of it, three snails frighten him by hissing]
Snail #1: Look who came to dinner. [Gary runs away]
Snail #3: Guess he didn't like nachos. [Gary slithers away until he runs into a dark figure]
Gramma: There you are. [grabs Gary] There you are, Miss Tuffsy. Oh, gramma finally found you. She was starting to get worried. Now let's get to your home, Miss Tuffsy, and get you something to eat. Hmmm. [shakes Gary] You feel much lighter than Gramma remembers. [cut to Gramma's house where she is feeding Gary heart-shaped cookies and putting an electric blanket over him] There you go, Miss Tuffsy. Gramma knows you like your Mr. Heaty set to extra cozy when you're home relaxing.
Gary: Mmm.
Gramma: Goodness, you're almost out of cookies. Here, I'll go and get some more. Now, don't you go running off again. [Gary looks at a spoon collection and looks at a picture of snails] There you go. [puts some more cookies on] After this, I'll go make up some of those deviled eggs I promised. [drops empty cookie sheet] Oh, how about a little music? Gramma's got a killer stereo system. [music warbling faster as Gramma cranks the record player. Gary continues to eat cookies as jazz music begins to play] Oh, this song reminds Gramma of her days as a riveter. [dances] You make Gramma feel so young. Come on, Miss Tuffsy, let's do the boogie-woogie. [while doing the dance, she breaks her back] Oh. [set Gary back on the chair] Okay, oh, that's enough of the boogie-woogie for now.
SpongeBob: Gary! Gary? Gary! [looks into a hat store. On the reflection of the window, a truck with a picture of a snail drives by and stops. SpongeBob turns around] Gary! [truck's logo says "Hungry Snails Loves Snail-Po". Tires squeal as the dust gets into SpongeBob's face and makes him cough] Gary...! [crying] Oh... Gary! [fade out to Gramma and Gary sitting on the couch watching TV]
Gramma: Gramma knows how much you love these late-night crime drama programs. Don't you, Miss Tuffsy? Oh, heavens, look at the time. [clock reads 7:30] It's time for bed, Miss Tuffsy. [when Gary jumps off the couch, a picture of SpongeBob comes out of his bag]
Gary: [sadly] Meow.
Picture of SpongeBob: Quiet, Gary! Can't you see I'm busy? [Gary gives a raspberry. Gary goes into a bright and decorated room with Gramma]
Gramma: Here's your room, Miss Tuffsy.
Gary: [questioningly] Meow?
Gramma: Here you are, darling. Let Gramma tuck you in. There you go. Oh, [Gary's sad, precious round eyes sparkle up at Gramma] I almost forgot your good night kiss. [kisses Gary] Sweet dreams, Miss Tuffsy. [walks out of the room and claps twice to make the lights go out. Cut to next day at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is walking into the Krusty Krab on his knees. He has bloodshot eyes]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...
Mr. Krabs: [snaps fingers] Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on. [puts his hat on his head] Knew I'd figure it out.
SpongeBob: [his tears drop on the patty] Gary.
Evelyn: Yeah, I'd like a refund for this Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Refund?! What's wrong with it?
Evelyn: Oh, nothing, really... except that it's covered in tears! [reveals that there are six tears on the patty]
Mr. Krabs: What the...?
SpongeBob: Gary... [crying]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!
SpongeBob: This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.
SpongeBob: Well, you see...
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob's mouth] That's enough, boy. See, it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes, it's what you don't say. Understand?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy!
SpongeBob: If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it.
Mr. Krabs:  Wh...?
[cut to Patrick sleeping on the ground. A bunch of things fall on Patrick and wake him up]
Patrick: It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary.
Patrick: But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference.
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do. [cut to Gramma]
Gramma: [squeezing orange juice from the orange] There you go, Miss Tuffsy—fresh squeezed. It takes longer to make it that way, but it was a labor of love.
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: How about a little more syrup on those pancakes? [pours syrup on the pancakes. Then takes the spoon and scoops up a bite for Gary] Here comes the train. Hoo-hoo! [cut to Gramma and Gary in the car] Set phasers on fun, Miss Tuffsy. [engine revving, tires squeal as Gramma drives fast over to Martha's Craft Zone] Oh, here we are. [both walk inside. As soon as the door closes, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive in the front door with posters and tape]
SpongeBob: Here's a good spot. [puts a poster on the door] "Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob". Quick, hand me the tape.
Patrick: Hey, they're having a sale on scented pine cones.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is no time for that. [Patrick goes in. SpongeBob sighs]
Patrick: Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.
Gramma: These pipe cleaners are simply delightful.
Patrick: Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!
Gramma: Well, I hope you weren't looking to buy them, sonny, because Gramma already picked up all they had.
Patrick: Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary. [walks out as Gary stares at him]
SpongeBob: [finishes putting up the posters] There.
Patrick: When Patrick comes out, the posters on the door are torn in half] Um...uhh...
SpongeBob: Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out. [walk off]
Gramma: [walks out] Come on, Miss Tuffsy, there's plenty more fun to be had.
♪Gary, now I know I was wrong, I messed up, and now you're gone. Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you. Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me feeling this empty. Your meow right now would sound like music to me. Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary. Gary, come home. Gary, can't you see I was blind, I'll do anything to change your mind. More than a pet, you're my best friend, too cool to forget, come back 'cause we are family and forgive me for making you wanna roam. And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome. Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three-word poem: Gary, come home!♪
Patrick: I want peanuts. [presses button in the airplane]
SpongeBob: Pat, no! [airplane loses control. Both scream as the airplane rides through the message in the sky "GARY COME HOME" and changes it to "LISA, WILL YOU MARRY ME?"]
Mable: Who is this 'Lisa' person?
Lenny: What? [Mable slaps him. Cut to Gramma walking into her house]
Gramma: Gramma will get a lovely meat loaf in the oven for you.
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: Don't worry, it's no trouble at all. Easy to do. [Gary smells his newspaper pile]
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: Oh, Miss Tuffsy, do you have to go potty? Here, why don't you use this stack of fliers given to me today by a little chubby boy. [Gary reads all the fliers that SpongeBob and Patrick made. Gary imagines SpongeBob in a thought bubble]
SpongeBob: Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go! [Gramma whistles]
Gramma: You stay right there. The meatloaf is almost done. [Gary groans, then slithers over and opens a closet door to find a bunch of empty snail shells] Oh, dear. The meatloaf is not quite ready yet, but Gramma knows how hungry you are, Miss Tuffsy, so she whipped up a quick batch of cookies. [belt on Gary's belly snaps. A bunch of fat breaks through his shell. The snails in the painting on the wall talk]
Snails in picture: Run! [Gary strains to get out of the shell pile, but does and rolls toward Gramma's cookie plate and out the pet door. She tries to throw cookies at him, but they get stuck in the door]
Gramma: You don't want cookies? Don't fret, I made a batch of deviled eggs, too. [Gary looks behind him and Gramma is slowly walking behind him] Come back, Miss Tuffsy. You don't want these to go to waste, do you? They were a labor of love. [Gary hides behind some trashcans in the alleyway] Oh, don't worry, Miss Tuffsy, Gramma will find you.
Snail #3: Hey! You're the guy that doesn't like nachos.
Gramma: Miss Tuffsy, I know you're back there, I can't hear your stomach growling. [Gary pushes Snail #3 out into the sidewalk]
Snail #3: Hey!
Gramma: Oh, there you are, Miss Tuffsy.
Snail #3: Who?
Gramma: You must be starving. [Gary sighs deeply. Cut to SpongeBob trying to cry on his couch]
Patrick: Just let it out, buddy. That's right.
SpongeBob: I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him.
Patrick: Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood! [SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] They were awesome!
SpongeBob: Gary loved balsa wood! [runs off crying] I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind. [look at the giant sign of Gary] I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.
Gary: [climbs on SpongeBob's head] Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, like that. [Gary purrs] Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary! [He kisses Gary] So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving.
Gary: [groans] Meow.


[Outside the Krusty Krab, a man is knocking on the doors.]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, some guy in a suit wants to come in before we open.
Mr. Krabs: What? Guy in a suit? No, it's a tax collector! [jumps inside SpongeBob’s mouth] Hide us, SpongeBob! [takes the register in with him] Now we'll walk nonchalantly to the rear exit. [Mr. Krabs legs stretch out of SpongeBob, and Mr. Krabs starts walking with them, lifting SpongeBob off the ground. The man knocks on the door again and holds up his business card]
Squidward: He's got a card. [reading business card] R.A. Penny Pincher: Vending Supplies.
Mr. Krabs: What? My machine has arrived?! Oh, let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in! [gets out of SpongeBob, who returns to his normal shape and size]
R.A. Penny Pincher: Bring it in, boys. [a worker brings in the machine, while another worker looks around the place]
Mr. Krabs: That's it, set her down easy.
R.A. Penny Pincher: Here are the keys, Mr. Krabs. [as he hands Mr. Krabs the keys.] Happy vending!
Squidward: What is it?
Mr. Krabs: Only the greatest money maker since the Krabby Patty. [as he reveals the machine covered up with a blanket] Gentlemen, meet Skill Crane!
SpongeBob: Ooh. Skill Crane.
Mr. Krabs: At a quarter a pop, this thing will pay for itself in no time. Which reminds me, step up, boys. First one's free. [takes out two golden coins]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [takes coin]
Squidward: No, thanks, I'll pass.
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, Squidward, you know you want to.
Squidward: [sighs] Okay, if you insist. [takes coin and puts it in his pocket] Thanks.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! In the machine!
Squidward: All right, all right. [puts coin in machine and moves crane] Oh, boy, what fun. [crane almost pulls out a dinosaur]
Skill Crane: You lose!
Squidward: [Suddenly goes berserk] Did you see that, SpongeBob?! I almost got that on my first try!
Mr. Krabs: [Satisfied] My work here is done. [walks away]
Squidward: They don't call me Squidward 'Manual Dexterity' Tentacles for nothing. [moves his tentacles up and down and so does SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Well, why don't I give it a try? [as he pulls out the quarter and puts it in the machine]
Squidward: Haha, good luck. You'll…
Skill Crane: Winner!
SpongeBob: It's a bear! I'm gonna call you Beary.
Squidward: Hmph, beginner's luck. Now it's the master's turn. [puts another coin in and grabs a cat. He mashes a button that says "Grab" but the crane drops the cat]
Skill Crane: Loser!
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, you flipped him over! [as Squidward looks at SpongeBob] That takes an awful amount of skill.
Squidward: Well, thank you for saying so.
SpongeBob: Beary says he's getting lonely. Don't worry, Beary, I'll get you a friend. [enters a coin in Skill Crane]
Squidward: Ha! If you think you're winning that thing again…
Skill Crane: Winner!
SpongeBob: There ya go, Beary. [shows a pink, fat cat with her tongue sticking out]
Squidward: Oh, I loosened that one up for you. You would've never won that without my skill.
SpongeBob: Wow, thanks for your help, Squidward. [walks off]
Squidward: Hmph. I bet I win at this thing the very next time I try. Now all I have to do is… [thought bubble with Mr. Krabs in it appears above Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: [echoing] At a quarter a pop, this thing pays for itself in no time.
Squidward: Ha! I'm not falling for that malarkey. [later, Squidward is behind the register]
SpongeBob: [Skill Crane makes the sound of a winner. SpongeBob walks by with a blue prize animal from Skill Crane] Hey, Squidward. [he sighs as Skill Crane makes the sound of a winner. SpongeBob walks by with a rabbit from Skill Crane] Hey, Squidward. [he sighs again as Skill Crane makes the sound of a winner. SpongeBob walks by with a two-headed pink prize animal from Skill Crane] Hey, Squidward. [laughing from the kitchen] Okay, Mrs. Wiggles, order up. Beary cooked this one all by himself. Oh, he makes me so proud.
Skill Crane: [distinct scratchy voice] Squid…ward. [crane swinging back and forth] Squid…ward.
Squidward: [sighs] Oh, what the… Alright. Let's get this over with.
Mr. Krabs: Need some change? [Squidward hands him the dollar, swipes it out of his hand, and gives him four coins in exchange] There ya are.
Squidward: Gee, thanks.
Mr. Krabs: No, no, Mr. Squidward. Thank you. [Squidward inserts coin in machine]
Skill Crane: You lose.
Mr. Krabs: Need some more change? [gives Squidward more coins but Squidward keeps on losing over and over, dollar after dollar]
Skill Crane: You lose!
Mr. Krabs: Need some change?
Squidward: No...
Mr. Krabs: What? Why?
Squidward: [softly] Because... I'm... all... out... of... [yelling at Mr. Krabs] MONEY!!
Mr. Krabs: All out of…? Hmmm. [later, comes out of his office] Boys, it's payday!
SpongeBob: [gasps] But, Mr. Krabs, today is Monday!
Mr. Krabs: What the... No. It's payday, me boy. Here's your check, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Money, money, money, money, money!
Mr. Krabs: I took the liberty of turning your paycheck... [as he shows Squidward the bag of quarters] ...into quarters. Just in case you wanna... oh, I don't know, do laundry or [as he jiggles the bag] buy a soda or... something.
Squidward: Very funny, Mr. Krabs. If I can't win one of those stupid things with this quarter, I'm walking away.
Narrator: [reading time card] Six hours later…
SpongeBob: [Squidward sitting on ground with empty bag over head] Pardon me, Squidward. SpongeBear, Jr. here wants me to win him a little brother. [Squidward scoots to the side while SpongeBob inserts a coin into the machine]
Skill Crane: You are a winner! [two prizes come out]
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Two in one quarter? That's not fair. [puts in one of the prizes] What's that, clown frown? Oh, you'd rather sit next to lovely lion? [takes the crane and moves the prizes around] There you are, nice and cozy. See ya later, Squidward.
Squidward: [scoots his way into his house and then sits on his couch and sighs] A little mind-numbing television ought to help me forget about that stupid machine. [tries to pick up the remote but every time he tries, he fails because of the crane coming into his mind. He then uses his eye instead to press a button on the remote] Yeeowwww! [he slides off the couch. Now he's in bed] You've had a rough day, Squiddie. But that doesn't mean tomorrow won't be better. [tries to pull his covers but he can't because of the crane coming into his mind] Ooh, phooey! [he shivers for a few seconds, gets up and then tries to pick up the glass of water by his bed but drops it and breaks it] I GOTTA WIN THAT CRANE!! [he runs through his closet door and gets the piggy bank, which cries a teardrop. He then runs to the Krusty Krab. Later, SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab and freaks out at what he sees when he enters] Just once! Please, oh, please, let me win one time!
SpongeBob: Squid, I think you have a problem.
Mr. Krabs: No, he doesn't. You don't listen to him, Squidward. You keep playing until you win! [takes out all the quarters that were put in the machine and pours them into a bucket. A piece of rolled paper drops into the bucket] What's this?
Squidward: The deed to my house.
Mr. Krabs: Okey-dokey, then. Carry on.
Squidward: [bawling] If I can just win once, I'd never play again! [wailing]
SpongeBob: Hey, you want me to tell you the secret of how to win on this machine?
Squidward: [gasps] SpongeBob! There's a secret?!?!
SpongeBob: Mmhmm.
Squidward: Tell... me... [as his eyes get bigger] the... secret.
SpongeBob: Are you ready to be a winner?
Squidward: Yes.
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Squidward: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Yes?
Squidward: Yes!
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Squidward: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Yes?
Squidward: SpongeBob! The secret?!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, okay. I face the crane. Deposit my quarter. Then I close my eyes.
Squidward: Close your eyes?
SpongeBob: Quiet, Squidward. I'm being the crane.
Squidward: Oh, that's ludi...
Skill Crane: Winner!
SpongeBob: See? Now you try.
Squidward: This is ridiculous, if I close my eyes, how will I know where the...
SpongeBob: Squidward, do you wanna win or not? 
Squidward: [presses face against machine] YES, YES, I DO!!!!!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, put your quarter in.
Squidward: But this is my last quarter.
SpongeBob: In the machine, Squidward.
Squidward: Okay, okay. [he puts the quarter in the machine]
SpongeBob: Close your eyes. [Squidward does] Now be the crane. [while SpongeBob is telling him this, Squidward is playing the game] Be the crane... be the crane... be the crane.
Skill Crane: Winner!
Squidward: Whoo-hoo! Yeah! I knew I could do it! [laughs] I'm a winner!
SpongeBob: You're a winner!
Squidward: I am a winner, aren't I? [jumps up and down] Winner, winner, winner! [twirls] Wiiiiiinner! [over loudspeaker] I'M A WINNER, EVERYBODY!!! YOU HEAR THAT!?! [cricket chirps in the empty restaurant. Squidward goes into Mr. Krabs' office, holds the teddy bear] I'm... a winner!
Mr. Krabs: That's funny. Last I checked, you were a cashier.
Squidward: Yuck it up all you want, Mr. Krabs. But just remember, you're yucking in the presence... of a winner! [shoves the bear in his face] HA! [runs out the door]
Mr. Krabs: I'll try to remember that. [as he counts all of Squidward's quarters] 3,498 of Squidward's quarters... 3,499 of Squidward's quarters.
SpongeBob: Triple decker, on deck.
Squidward: [slams door in SpongeBob's face] Make way for the winner! [door opens to SpongeBob having the triple decker hanging out of his mouth like an accordion]
Skill Crane: You lose! [Billy sighs]
Squidward: You didn't win the prize?
Billy: No...
Squidward: You know what that means?
Billy: No, what?
Squidward: It means, you have no skills and you're a loser! HA! Hahahaha! I'm a winner, see my prize, you're a loser who sits and cries! [he laughs, then Billy kicks him in the shin] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! [later, Squidward and SpongeBob are walking out of the Krusty Krab] Did you see how I handled that crane?
SpongeBob: I sure did.
Squidward: I think I had the magic touch.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Squidward: I just closed my eyes and became the crane.
SpongeBob: [getting exasperated] Oh, yeah, you're the man.
Squidward: SpongeBob, look. [a real crane is just a few yards away. Squidward runs to it]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Squidward, I don't think the same principles apply.
Squidward: Be the crane...
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward!
Squidward: Be the crane... [picks up an I-beam]
SpongeBob: He did it. Yay, Squidward!
Squidward: Be the crane... be the crane... be the…
Construction Worker: You know this guy?
SpongeBob: Yeah, that's Squidward. He's got the magic touch. [pokes the construction worker] Ding. [Squidward knocks a bunch of buildings over with the I-beam; a sign reads "Your New Mall". The construction worker is twitching in fury] Tada! [notices the mess] Ah! Squidward, open your eyes!
Squidward: [opens eyes] Oh, uhh, be the crane. Be the crane. [can't control crane; he whacks the workers with a beam] Look out, SpongeBob. I can't stop! [crane chases after SpongeBob and the workers; SpongeBob's eyes bug out so he runs away on them] Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. Okay, don't be the crane! Don't be the crane!! [Everybody runs in terror into the Krusty Krab. The crane spins around fast and heads towards the Krusty Krab and as the workers and SpongeBob duck, Squidward destroys it]
Mr. Krabs: What the?
Squidward: Oh, my. Ohhh, my. Uhh... time to go, Teddy. [bumps into large construction worker]
Milt: Just where do you think you're going, crane master? [All workers surround Squidward, ready to beat him up]
Gerome: You ain't going anywhere.
SpongeBob: [whistles] Hang on, buddy. I got ya. [uses crane to get Squidward, but instead gets his prize] I guess I can only pick up toys.
Squidward: [workers growl] Uh-oh!

[Everyone is sleeping until SpongeBob's foghorn alarm wakes them up]
Squidward: SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?!
SpongeBob: I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.
Squidward: Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.
SpongeBob: My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for.
Squidward: You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.
SpongeBob: What's that, Squidward?
Squidward: It's Sunday! [angrily kicks SpongeBob out of his house] A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!
SpongeBob: Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgot his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him. [breaks the string that holds the paper together] Man this is heavy. [bumps into Patrick] Oh, pardon me.
Patrick: Hey, watch where you're going. [screams] Newspaper monster!
SpongeBob: [throws paper in the air, screaming] AHH!!! Monster! [both scream and run around]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
Squidward: Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday. [hums] My Sunday relaxation kit. [reaches into box] Let's see…pillow. [puts pillow on end of couch] Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance. [sprays fragrance on flower. The flower dies] Ah, and the final touch. [dials on phone] Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man. [hangs up phone] This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot. [grabs a box] Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder, take me on a chocolate vacation. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick raise up from behind the couch making noises. Squidward spits out his chocolate]
Patrick: Ooooooooohhhhhh!
SpongeBob: Ooooooohhhhh!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: By the all seeing eye, ye are worthy. We are not.
Squidward: What are you two idiots doing?
Patrick: Secret ritual.
SpongeBob: To inaugurate you as president.
Squidward: Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.
Patrick: No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.
Squidward: Better?
SpongeBob: You're the president of The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge!
Squidward: The WHAT?! Oh, is this some stupid club you two made up?!
Patrick: Hehehehe...maybe. [both laugh]
SpongeBob: It's a secret. [both laugh]
Squidward: Fine. As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer? [pushing SpongeBob &amp; Patrick out the door] Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays. [when he closes the door, SpongeBob &amp; Patrick appear from inside]
SpongeBob: What color should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?
Squidward: Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Wow. Polka dots.
Patrick: Our new president is a genius.
SpongeBob: Yeah. [both laugh]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: See ya later, Squidward.
SpongeBob: [now outside, a red paint can drops on the ground] Whenever you're ready, Patrick.
Patrick: [Patrick unscrews SpongeBob's hat which turns out to be a screw] Hold still, buddy. [pours the red paint inside SpongeBob's hole. When he is done, he throws the can away and ends up hitting an elderly citizen riding a bike. Patrick screws the hat back in]
SpongeBob: Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake.
Patrick: Okie dokie. [Patrick shakes SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay! I'm ready! [Patrick grabs SpongeBob's arm and uses it like a slot machine. Drops of red paint come shooting out SpongeBob's holes and onto trees] Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot.
Squidward: [clock on wall is ringing noon] Oh, no. It's already noon. I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [outside one of Squidward's windows singing] Good neighbors are we. La-la-la-la-la-la.
Squidward: What's going on out there?
SpongeBob: Hi, president Squidward. Almost done painting the- [Patrick pulls on SpongeBob's arm which makes the paint shoot out his holes and all over Squidward's face and in his eyes]
Squidward: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! MY EYES!! [runs around bumping into stuff. Runs outside and in front of a car]
Gale Rechid: Look out! [car slams on brakes and stops in front of Squidward]
Ralph: Oh, you poor man.
Gale: You must be very sick! Let us take you to the hospital.
Squidward: No really, I'm fine. Please, I…no, uhh… [car drives off]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: See ya later, neighbor!
Patrick: It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.
SpongeBob: Yeah, our president sure knows how to live. [later] I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick. [Patrick is snoring] Okay…Squidward? [Squidward's chair is empty] Squidward? Squidward, you home?
Patrick: Did you find him, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.
Patrick: Or maybe he's on a secret mission.
SpongeBob: I hope he's not in danger.
Patrick: Danger?!
SpongeBob: As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger.
Harold (red fish): Excuse me? Somebody ordered a relaxing pedicure and foot massage? The Sunday special?
SpongeBob: Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward.
Squidward: At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are laughing inside Squidward's house. Squidward opens his front door] What are you two doing in my house?
SpongeBob: We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.
Patrick: I say he checks out a-ok.
SpongeBob: Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips? [shows foot with long toenails]
Squidward: French tips, huh? [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick's chair out of the way] Alright, pal, make with the relaxing foot massage, pronto!
Harold (red fish): Uh-oh. Sorry. Your hour's up. [packed up and leave]
Squidward: [He shockedly twitches his eye. As SpongeBob happily continues wiggling his toes, he angrily makes way toward the front door] Alright, you two! OUT!!! [SpongeBob and Patrick, realizing that they are in trouble, slowly walk out] And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day! Or tomorrow! Or next week!
SpongeBob: Squidward, does that include…
Squidward: [angrily screams] YES, IT DOES! [furiously slams door]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?
Squidward: [angrily bursts head through the door, exploding] YES, I WAS! You call yourselves good neighbors? YOU'RE THE WORST NEIGHBORS EVER! [deep breath] You don't deserve to wear those fezzes! [furiously takes SpongeBob and Patrick's fezzes and angrily stomps them into the ground]
SpongeBob: Gee, Pat, maybe President Squidward's right.
Patrick: Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all.
Squidward: [furiously explodes once again] NO, YOU AREN'T!!! YOU'RE HORRIBLE NEIGHBORS!!! [he angrily hyperventilates] AND STOP CALLING ME PRESIDENT!!!
SpongeBob: C'mon, let's go. [SpongeBob and Patrick sadly walk away]
Squidward: There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper. [notices pile of paper on ground with a note on it]
SpongeBob: ['Here's Your Sunday Paper Squidward. Enjoy. Love, SpongeBob.'.]
[Squidward steams up furiously, kicks the paper into the air, then growls like a dog. Then he takes a paper off his head.]
Squidward: Good neighbors my right. [reads paper] Hello? "Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation" [Squidward does an evil laugh. Later, he has the security system built in and turned on]
Security System: System Activated.
Squidward: That oughta do it. Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now.
SpongeBob: [he with Patrick, with their fezzes back on, walk up to Squidward] President Squidward?
Squidward: [screams] What the…?!
SpongeBob: We hereby present you with this delicious cake.
Squidward: [reads writing on cake] "Sorry for bugging you so much"? What the…? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!
Security System: No threat detected.
Squidward: [angry, banging on security system] Grrr! You infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!
Security System: Threat detected. [The system shoots a laser at Squidward which makes SpongeBob &amp; Patrick's cake fly into the air and land on the system, causing it to go haywire.]
Squidward: What's going on?
Security System: Threat detected. Code red. Code red!
SpongeBob: [laughing as fireworks are shooting out all over Squidward's house] It's like a carnival ride!
Squidward: [running around] Run for your lives! [Squidward's house suddenly grows legs and arms and stands up. Then grabs Squidward from inside] What the-? What are you doing?! [Squidward's house kicks him into the air and walks off.] I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for. [laughs hysterically] I am gonna relax if it kills me.
[Meanwhile, Squidward's house is on a rampage.]
Army: Fire! [The tank fires a missile at the house, but the house catches the missile and flicks it away. Then the house grabs the tank and squishes it.]
Patrick: Wow. Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood.
SpongeBob: We gotta turn this thing off. [turns on a light switch] Nope, not it.
Patrick: [flushes the toilet] Nope.
SpongeBob: [turns on the fan] Nope.
Patrick: [pushes the toasted button down] That's not it, either.
Squidward: [still resting] This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot. [house stands right above Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hmmm, where to look. [notices an "off button" on the wall] Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious. [pushes button and house sits on top of Squidward and goes back to normal] We did it, Patrick! [Squidward busts through from beneath the floor] President Squidward?
Squidward: No-no, don't say anything. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so that I can get ready for work tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Mr. President-
Squidward: Shush.
SpongeBob: But we just wanted to…
Squidward: [yells in their faces angrily] Get out of my house! Huh?
[As soon as SpongeBob and Patrick flee from Squidward, a whole angry mob and two police boats appear outside Squidward's house.]
Scooter: There he is!
Jasper (green fish): Are you the owner of this house?
Squidward: Yes! Yes, I am!
Jasper (green fish): Then on behalf of the citizens of Bikini Bottom, [the angry fish hands him a warrant] I present you with this summons to pay for the destruction of our town. You'll be doing community service every Sunday for the rest of your life.
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too? [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick walk up with a summons in their hands] This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward!
[Squidward twitches with rage.]



[The episode starts inside the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is counting money at the register until he feels a rumble coming from outside.]
Mr. Krabs: Here they come, lads!
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Squidward: Fantastic. [crowd comes rushing in running over Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you very much, madam. [Mr. Krabs pushes the key to open the cash register over and over] I feel so alive! ♪Cha ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaree. Money, oh money, how I love thee. Cha-ching. Cha-chong. Cha-changaroo. From pennies to dollars. Any amount will do. Cha-ching. Cha-ching. It's no contest. There's only one thing that I love the best from every sight I ever seen, to sweetest sound I've heard. I'd gladly give up everything for all the money that I've earned! Cha-ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed!♪
Squidward: Please don't do that again.
Howard: [walks in the Krusty Krab] I think the stain glass barstool can go over here. And the suede hand carved wooden sports flag display case can go over there.
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there, matey. Can I help you gentlemen with something?
Howard: I'd like to speak to the owner.
Mr. Krabs: Who wants to know?
Howard: Allow me to introduce myself. Howard Blandy: President of the Blandy Franchising Company.
Mr. Krabs: Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy? [gets on his knees] I worship you. [cries]
Howard: Get it together, little man.
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, it's just you're rich. [laughs] I'm Mr. Krabs. To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?
Howard: [slaps Mr. Krabs’ claw] What would it take to buy the Krusty Krab from you?
Mr. Krabs: Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon... [suitcase full of money is shown to Mr. Krabs] Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think, Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me.
Howard: Oh, there's a lot more than that. The rest is over there. [points to a boat full of suitcases with money]
Mr. Krabs: Jumpin' King Neptune! [gulps] Sold. Can I have my money?
Howard: Just one thing. If you can sign this contract. It just states that you relinquish the Krusty Krab and all proprietary ownership thereof. Along with its employees, merchandise, logos, and cash registers.
Mr. Krabs: Do I still get the money?
Howard: Of course.
Mr. Krabs: That'll be fine then. [signs contract] Here you go. Now gimme gimme gimme gimme. [holds suitcase up in the air] Whoo-ha! See ya around. [walks out of the Krusty Krab. Contractors &amp; painters come in remodeling]
SpongeBob: What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on?
Mr. Krabs: I'm retiring!
SpongeBob: Retiring?
Mr. Krabs: I'm free to do whatever I want. I can learn to ride that bicycle I got 30 years ago. Or go to the new hook museum downtown. Or even paint bowls of fruit. Aren't you happy for me?
SpongeBob: I sure am.
Mr. Krabs: So long, boys.
SpongeBob: Have fun, Mr. Krabs. [cries]
Squidward: Heaven knows I won't.
Carl: Hi, gentlemen, I'm Carl. I'll be your new manager.
SpongeBob: New manager?
Carl: I think you'll find working at the Krabby O'Monday’s to be a both learning experience and enjoyable one.
SpongeBob: Krabby O'Monday’s?
Carl: [takes away their Krusty Krew hats] You won't be needing these anymore. [hands them new clothes] Now here are your new uniforms and here are the... [hands them heavy books] employee manuals. See ya first thing tomorrow.
Mr. Krabs: [driving boat and smelling the air] Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop: the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll... [sees the Krabby O'Monday’s] Hey, the Krabby O'Monday’s? Not the name I would've chosen, but that's all behind me now. [later, Mr. Krabs is at the Hook Museum listening to the story narrator about a 3 prong hook. Then he is at his home painting a bowl of fruit, which he actually paints a bowl of Krabby Patties. Then he is playing golf] Wait a minute. I hate golf! [now laying in his bed at home, sucking drool back into his mouth] Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon.
Pearl: [on phone] Did you see the shoes she has on? So last year. [laughs. Notices her father in the doorway] Hold on, Gina. Yeah, Dad?
Mr. Krabs: How's it going?
Pearl: Fine.
Mr. Krabs: Whatcha up to?
Pearl: I'm talking on the phone! 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, really?
Pearl: Really.
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
Pearl: Dad, isn't there something you need to do?
Mr. Krabs: Actually, I was hoping you and I could do something together.
Pearl: [pushes him out] Get out! That's it, Dad. Get a job, get a hobby, or get some friends. Because I can't take it anymore! [slams the door offscreen]
Mr. Krabs: [using metal detector on the beach] Get some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says... [runs into a window with a 'Help Wanted' sign] Help wanted. [walks into the Krabby O'Monday’s]
Squidward: Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O'Monday’s.
Tyler: It's my birthday.
Squidward: Can I start you off with...
Mother: Will you sing the Krabby O'Monday’s birthday song to my special little man?
Squidward: Happy, happy birthday. [sighs, as the family frowns in disgust] Happy, happy bir...
Carl: Uhh, Squidward, can I talk to you for a second? What's our motto here at Krabby O'Monday’s?
Squidward: Sincere service with a smile?
Carl: Well, yes, but with the Krabby O'Monday’s spirit. Now, Squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources... [A big strong guy slowly steps out of the Human Resources doorway, punching his fist in his open hand, menacingly] ...would you? So, what's our motto again?
Squidward: Sincere service [slaps self; forcefully smiling] with a smile. [he draws his eyes back to the big strong guy who slowly goes back into the room]
Carl: Now you're gettin' it.
Mr. Krabs: [in kitchen cleaning dishes] Morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy. [whistles as he sees SpongeBob with a big smile] Uhh, okay, son. You're starting to creep my out.
SpongeBob: [clings to Mr. Krabs] I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, back to work.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not your boss anymore. Just call me Eugene.
SpongeBob: Aye aye... Eugene. [giggles, while Mr. Krabs makes a weird look]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, Squidward.
Squidward: Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you so happy.
Squidward: [looks at Carl with his teeth grinned] They're watching us.
Mr. Krabs: That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy? [laughs, as Carl looks suspicious]
Squidward: Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules.
Squidward: I really think you should look. [pointing to a message]
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Help me?
Carl: Hey fellas, [Squidward quickly slams the book closed] what's going on over here?
Squidward: Oh, hey, Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene of article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook.
Carl: Cut the chatter, and pick up a platter. [slaps him] Good job, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: What have you done to the real Squidward?
Carl: The less you know, Eugene, the better. [closes the door]
Mr. Krabs: What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob? [in the kitchen, Krabby Patties are being made in a different way through an oven and spray painted to make it look like a real Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [takes a Krabby Patty from the basket] Where's the love?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!
Mr. Krabs: This is obscene. [walks out of the kitchen] Carl, I need to have a word with...
Cash Register: Your change is $1.75.
Mr. Krabs: Automated cash register? Noo! [eyes roll back in his head] Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?
Carl: Look around you. Our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre. [customer falls asleep, snoring]
Mr. Krabs: That's because they don't know what they're eating. [grabs a pile of the gray sludge from the Krabby Patty making machine in the kitchen, then walks up to a customer] Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that Krabby Patty you're eating?
Martha Smith: No. [Mr. Krabs shows her a pile of the gray sludge. The customer screams and runs out]
Mr. Krabs: See that? Without all your smoke &amp; mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage.
Frank: What'd he say? Garbage? [customers notice what's in the Krabby Patties and everyone runs out]
Carl: Eugene, you're in violation of your contract.
Mr. Krabs: Rules! Here's a rule for ya: people can't eat stain glass barstools! [throws barstool into the big screen TV and takes the cash register to the kitchen] I'll show you automated!
Carl: Mr. Blandy? Code red! Free thinker!
[Mr. Krabs shoves the cash register in the Krabby Patty making machine]
Howard: Mr. Krabs, is there a problem here?
Mr. Krabs: You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt! [Krabby Patty machine inflates and about to blow up.]
Carl: Oh, my. [The garbage blows up from the kitchen and blows everybody away off the Krabby O'Monday’s including the employees. The restaurant blows up and got destroyed. Carl was seen floating away.] Does this mean I won't get that raise, sir?
Howard: [he looks at the restaurant which is destroyed by the gray meat] It's ruined!
Friend: We'll have to sell it. We'll be lucky if we get a fraction of what we paid for it. [Mr. Krabs drives up with boat full of suitcases]
Mr. Krabs: I'll buy it for full price.
Friend: Sold. We won't need your contract anymore. [rips off the contract] Nice doing business with you.
Mr. Krabs: Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant. [laughs while Howard and his friends walks away, leaving SpongeBob and Squidward.] Well, we did it, boys. [puts the hats on them] The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends.
Squidward: Really, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: No, not really. Get back to work! [He hands them Spatula and the Mop. SpongeBob was glad while Squidward was annoyed leaving Mr. Krabs, who now  pushes the key to open the register and ends with dollar signs.]


[Squidward is sleeping until SpongeBob knocks on the door causing him to wake up]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: [opens his window] What do you want, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar. [laughs]
Squidward: More like another nickel.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Good one, Squidward! [scene cuts to Squidward and SpongeBob walking down the street and SpongeBob is laughing] Another day, another nickel. [laughs]
Squidward: It's not that funny.
SpongeBob: It's funny, because it's true! [laughs. SpongeBob clings on to Squidward's legs as they walk into the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Move over. [flicks SpongeBob off his legs and into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [peeks through the kitchen window] Nickel. [laughs]
Squidward: [brings food tray over to a customer] Here's your food. [SpongeBob is laughing behind him] It's not that funny! [slams tray down] Please make it stop! [SpongeBob is running into the kitchen then out of Mr. Krabs office still laughing. Scene zooms into Squidward with a bunch of SpongeBobs laughing around his head. Scene cuts to Squidward flipping the 'OPEN' sign to 'CLOSED' then walking out of the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob still laughing. Squidward enters his house then shuts the door in SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, see you tomorrow. [laughs. Scene cuts to morning at the Krusty Krab]
Customer #1: And always check for spare change.
SpongeBob: Another day, another...nickel! [brings food to customer] 2 Krabby Patties.
Customer #2: Thanks, kid.
SpongeBob: Another day, another nickel.
Customer #2: Oh. [all 3 of them laugh]
Squidward: He's gone laughing tormentor. [SpongeBob continues to laugh but every few seconds, he gets an ache in his side and Squidward takes notice of this] This could be my chance. [enters kitchen] SpongeBob, you don't look well!
SpongeBob: I don't?
Squidward: No. You should sit down.
SpongeBob: But...
Squidward: [sticks a cooking thermometer in SpongeBob's mouth] Shh, shh, shh. [feels his forehead] You're burning up, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I am?
Squidward: Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?
SpongeBob: Yeah, a little.
Squidward: And your temperature is 175 degrees!
SpongeBob: It's that bad?
Squidward: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing.
SpongeBob: I have been laughing a lot, lately.
Squidward: [gasps] SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're going to burn out your laugh box.
SpongeBob: My laugh box?
Squidward: Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again.
SpongeBob: Is that what happened to you, Squidward?
Squidward: Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again. [scene fades to Sandy walking up to Patrick]
Sandy: Hey, Patrick, you want to hear a joke?
Patrick: Sure, Sandy.
SpongeBob: [in a lung capacity machine] Sure, I'd love a good laugh.
Sandy: What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck! [Sandy and Patrick laugh normally while SpongeBob's laugh is robotic. Sandy and Patrick giggle nervously and backs away slowly]
SpongeBob: I don't want to burn out my laugh box, Squidward.
Squidward: Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous.
SpongeBob: How long do I have to avoid laughing?
Squidward: Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe.
SpongeBob: Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you! [later SpongeBob is walking out of the Krusty Krab] A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant. [looks over to his right] Nothing funny over there. [looks over to his left] Nothing funny over here.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?
SpongeBob: [notices banana peel in front of Patrick on the ground] Patrick, banana peel, don't!
Patrick: What'd you say? [slips on banana peel]
SpongeBob: Oh, no. [stifles laughter]
Patrick: Hey, what the... [slips on banana peel again]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, Patrick! [Patrick slips on the banana peel again] Please stop!
Patrick: Right foot first...
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh.
Patrick: You can't? Oh, I know what to do! [flaps his lips and SpongeBob runs away] That usually knocks him out. [continues flapping his lips then slips on the banana peel again]
SpongeBob: [runs behind a building] Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control. [steps on a whoopee cushion] Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob. [steps on another whoopee cushion. He gasps] They're everywhere. Everywhere!
Delivery Fish: Look out for that pie truck! [pie truck crashes into the whoopee cushion truck. SpongeBob laughs a little as the big pie on top of the truck falls on the driver]
SpongeBob: I gotta get outta here. [runs out of the Bikini Bottom city limits] There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe... [digs himself a hole to bury himself in. He gets in. Now only his nose is seen. He stays there as the day turns to night, then it is morning and a clam crows like a rooster] Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing. [tries to laugh, but wheezes instead] That's odd. [wheezes again, with a weird deflating sound] I've lost my laugh. [screams and runs back into Bikini Bottom] I've lost my laugh! [screams again, then knocks on Patrick's rock]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!
Patrick: What happened?
SpongeBob: I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone.
Patrick: Let me take a look. [inserts his head into SpongeBob's mouth] Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match. [lights a match. Smoke fills SpongeBob and Patrick can't get him off his head so he runs around screaming. Later, at the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Come in.
SpongeBob: [crying] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: I lost my laugh.
Mr. Krabs: You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh. [both look at money but only Mr. Krabs laughs] Don't it just tickle you, boy?
SpongeBob: Not really.
Mr. Krabs: This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it.
SpongeBob: [touches money] Nothing.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy.
SpongeBob: Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist. [later at Sandy's treedome]
Sandy: Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob. Now, what is laughter?
SpongeBob: The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose, but now mocks me with its cruel indifference.
Sandy: [pulls down a chart of the body] But scientifically speaking, it's caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset.
SpongeBob: Sounds painful.
Sandy: Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob. [hands SpongeBob a bunch of books] Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Sandy.
Squidward: Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack.
SpongeBob: I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again. [moans and groans into his pineapple]
Squidward: I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy. [laughs. "Later that same evening timecard is shown and the French narrator reads it]
Narrator: Later that same evening...
Squidward: [is playing clarinet when he hears SpongeBob crying] I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon. [SpongeBob cries tears on the side of Squidward's house and night turns into day as Squidward's house plugs up its ears] What have I done? [SpongeBob cries a river into Squidward's house causing it to flood him outside] Oh, that's it! This charade has to end. [realizes his feet are underwater and walks to SpongeBob's house. He knocks on SpongeBob's door and lots of tears come out]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop.
SpongeBob: But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box! [sprays a fountain of tears into Squidward's face. Squidward puts his tentacles over SpongeBob's eyes, stopping the tears]
Squidward: SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!
SpongeBob: You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression.
Squidward: (taken aback by the revelation) Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes.
SpongeBob: I could laugh the whole time?
Squidward: Yeah. [both laugh] You really fell for it.
SpongeBob: I guess I did.
Squidward: You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [stops laughing] It's really not that funny, Squidward.
Squidward: It's hilarious!
SpongeBob: See ya later, Squidward. [goes into his house]
Squidward: [still laughing] Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel. [his laughter turns to coughing as his sides started aching] yahhhh! [Squidward inhales deeply and lets out a long cough, (thus losing his laughter) and falls flat to the ground, while two paramedics come take him to the hospital]
Patrick: Look, he's waking up.
Squidward: (groans) Where am I?
Sandy: You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box.
Mr. Krabs: The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on.
Patrick: So they cut it out.
Squidward: Cut it out?!
Patrick: Yeah, wanna see it? [holds up jar with Squidward's laugh box in it] It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around.
Squidward: [screams] Gimme! Oh. I can never laugh again?
Doctor: Nonsense. Your laugh should be stronger than ever.
Squidward: But, you cut out my laugh box.
Doctor: Yes, but uhh, one of your friends generously allowed us to transplant part of theirs to you.
Patrick: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: They wouldn't pay me.
Sandy: You're getting warmer.
Squidward: [SpongeBob shows his scar] SpongeBob? [laughs like SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hey, you laugh just like me. [both laugh. Squidward laughs too much so he runs through the wall] Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world. [laughs]


[A green car comes driving up and stops. Kelp Thing gets out.]
[Mermaid Man is shown on a building.]
Kelp Thing: Huh? Eh?
Narrator: It's Mermaid Man! Savior of the deep! [Barnacle Boy comes in] And his young fit servant, Barnacle Boy.
Mermaid Man: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy...unite! [both put rings together, then jump down onto Kelp Thing's car] Kelp Thing, this is a posted, no-parking zone.
Kelp Thing: But I must do what I do. [jumps up in the air until he notices his car is being towed] Huh? [The word "TOWED" comes on screen. Kelp Thing jumps down and then walks away]
Mermaid Man: Evil can't park here between the hours of 6:00am and 12:00pm! [the word "FIN" appears on-screen. The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club is watching a video about the heroes. They cheer]
Club Leader: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club members unite! [puts hands together in air]
All: Unite!
Club Leader: And now the second order of business: Drippy Brothers Studios is currently in production of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie!
All: Ooh!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy, Patrick, I can hardly wait to see our favorite heroes on the big screen!
[Patrick laughs]
Club Leader: Third order of business, the special surprise guest! [all gasp] The stars of the Mermaid Man movie are here tonight! [everyone cheers] Directly from the set, here they are! [curtain opens, revealing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy actors]
Fake Mermaid Man: Hello, little heroes.
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: You're not Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. You're fakes!
Fake Mermaid Man: Well, of course, we are. We're actors.
SpongeBob: Actors? How can they make a Mermaid Man movie without the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Fake Mermaid Man: Listen, kid, this is an action movie. Your has-been heroes are too OLD for action.
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man is timeless!
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: I think I speak for everyone here when I say we won't stand for these two phony-baloneys ruining the good name of our heroes. No right-minded Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy society member would ever pay to see this... this celluloid hoax. I say we boycott this movie! Now who's with me? [SpongeBob and Patrick are thrown out of the building] Traitors! Wait ‘til we tell Mermaid Man about this. [cut to the retirement home]
Announcer: B-47.
Mermaid Man: BONKO!
Barnacle Boy: [puts his hands on Mermaid Man] It's "bingo".
Mermaid Man: [slaps Barnacle Boy's hand away] Get your hands off me, woman!
Announcer: A-29.
SpongeBob: [walks in angrily] Too old for an action movie...huh.
Barnacle Boy: What is it this time, kid?
SpongeBob: Are you aware Drippy Brothers Studio is making the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie?
Barnacle Boy: They can't be making a movie about us!
SpongeBob: But they are! And they're using... [close-up of SpongeBob's mouth] actors.
[The heroes gasp.]
SpongeBob: They have shunned our heroes.
Patrick: And they weren't nice to them either.
Mermaid Man: [sobs] Now our dreams of being big screen heroes will never come true.
SpongeBob: Well, that makes it even worse.
Barnacle Boy: [Puts his hands on Mermaid Man's back] You bet it does, kid.
Mermaid Man: And the worst part is I can't remember why I started crying. [sobs some more]
Patrick: Why don't we just make our own movie?
SpongeBob: Patrick, once again, you have exposed your brilliance. We'll make a real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie. Right here at Shady Shoals.
Mermaid Man: [stops crying] You will?
SpongeBob: Yes! And in doing so, we will right the wrong done to you by the evil Drippy Brother Studios and... [close-up of SpongeBob's mouth] their actors.
Mermaid Man: [jumps on top of the table] Vindication is ours! Vindi... how did I get up here? [cut to Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?
Patrick: Popcorn?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, to start making a movie.
Patrick: Oh, oh, oh...
SpongeBob: Let's start with...the title.
Patrick: Yeah, yeah. Ooh! I got one! "Adventures in the Underground City".
SpongeBob: Great, Pat, what happens?
Patrick: Well, there's a city...
SpongeBob: [typing on a typewriter] City...
Patrick: And it's underground...
SpongeBob: [typing] Underground...
Patrick: And they have an adventure...
SpongeBob: [still typing] Adventure...
Patrick: The end.
SpongeBob: End. [stops typing] That's great, Pat. [checks paper] Hmm, seems kinda short.
Patrick: I have an idea. Let's make it longer!
SpongeBob: Longer, yes. Okay, let's have Mermaid Man get his face... [shrinks his face] ...shrunk by Kelp-Thing's face minimizer.
Patrick: Yeah, and then he...umm...he drinks...cheese coffee.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Good one, Pat. [both laugh]
Mr. Krabs: [walks to table] What are ye lads doing?
SpongeBob: We're making a movie.
Mr. Krabs: Great! I got cinema's newest star, right here.
SpongeBob: [looks through his fingers, which make a square shape staring at Pearl. She giggles and holds a Krabby Patty on a tray in her fin]
Mr. Krabs: So, what do ye say, lad?
SpongeBob: Sure, Mr. Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie.
Mr. Krabs: I wasn't talking about Pearl. I was talking about the Krabby Patty.
[Pearl looks at the Krabby Patty and starts crying massive tears]
SpongeBob: You can be in it, too, Pearl.
Pearl: [stops crying] I'm gonna be a movie star. [cut to outside Shady Shoals]
SpongeBob: Let's meet the highly skilled professionals who will help us fulfill your dream of being on the big screen. Sandy will handle the stunts and explosives. [Sandy holds up a bomb]
Sandy: Howdy.
SpongeBob: Pearl is the leading lady. Mr Krabs will cater the affair. [Mr. Krabs holds up a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Patrick will run the camera.
Patrick: Hey... [knocks over the camera and gets tangled up in roll]
SpongeBob: This is Squidward. He's in charge of the makeup department.
Squidward: [walks away] Uh, no thanks. Who wants to be the 'makeup department'?
SpongeBob: Not makeup department, you're the makeup 'artist'.
Squidward: [looks back] Artist?
SpongeBob: Makeup artist.
Squidward: In that case, let's make those old crabapples sizzle. [looks at the heroes] Hmmm... [close-ups of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's old, wrinkly faces] Time for the art-eest to go to work. [takes out the flamethrower and gets to work. Banging and screaming are heard. Squidward staples their faces together] Voila!
SpongeBob: Okay, places everybody. Squidward, are our heroes ready?
Squidward: As they'll ever be.
SpongeBob: [gasps. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are tied up and look like sausage links] They're beautiful! They look just like they did 30 years ago. [Mermaid Man slurping] Okay, action!
[explosion]
Sandy: I love my new job!
SpongeBob: Good job, Sandy!
Plankton: Psst... [has a mini Man Ray head on] I, Man Ray, have returned from the murky depths to seek my revenge and banish your souls to the nether regions. Their defenses are strong, but they are no match for my Man Ray ray. [takes out a flashlight and turns it on]
SpongeBob: What are you doing?
Plankton: SpongeBob, this role was made for me.
SpongeBob: That villain isn't even in this movie. But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications. Oh, here's something. [takes microphone stand] You can be the boom operator!
Plankton: I thought Sandy was the boom operator!
Sandy: Did somebody say boom?
[explosion]
Plankton: All right, SpongeBob, but you're squandering my talents!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, start the movie!
Assistant: Take 1.
Mermaid Man: We have to get back to those swollen Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's "stolen Krabby Patties."
Assistant: Take 2.
Mermaid Man: We have to get back to those stolen naggie daddies.
SpongeBob: Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's "stolen Krabby Patties!"
Assistant: [somewhat tired tone] Take 5,003.
Mermaid Man: We have to get back to those stolen Krabby Patties! And if we don't stop that diabolical scoundrel- [mumbles because Plankton accidentally shoves the microphone in his mouth]
Plankton: Give it back!
Barnacle Boy: I knew this was a bad idea.
SpongeBob: Cut! Plankton, next time could you keep the boom out of shot? Other than that, you're doing a super job.
Plankton: This is humiliating. I'm not good at this boom thing.
Sandy: Did somebody say boom?
[explosion]
Pearl: Oh, daddy, you said I was going to be a star!
Mr. Krabs: You are, Pearl. Mermaid Man wouldn't be anywhere without you. Go out there and break a leg.
Pearl: Yeah! [runs off and cut to steep mountain]
SpongeBob: Okay, action!
Mermaid Man: To the boat mobile. [both jump on the boat mobile, which is really Pearl on her back with wheels]
SpongeBob: Cue the sound effects. [Pearl uses her tongue for a boat engine]
Mermaid Man: Listen to that engine purr. [the assistant is straining as he tries to pull Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and Pearl up a steep cliff]
SpongeBob: Almost there! [the assistant grabs the edge of the cliff, but it breaks off causing them to slide down, over a curved slope and into the air. Patrick aims the camera so that it's directly on Pearl, the assistant, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Then they come crashing down onto the set. Pearl gets off of a flattened SpongeBob]
Patrick: Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Everything's ruined! Well, at least we got the footage.
Patrick: Yeah, I got the footage.
SpongeBob: Patrick, what is that?
Patrick: Oh, it's a camera.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, this. [takes off lens cap]
Patrick: Oh, that's a lens cap.
SpongeBob: Did you just put that on?!
Patrick: Yup, I didn't want to lose it, so I put it there right before we started filming.
[SpongeBob screams and goes insane, scoots his butt on the ground, lifts up piece of ground, and eats worms on bottom side. Everyone gasps.]
SpongeBob: [sobbing] The movie's ruined! We can't make a movie!
Mermaid Man: Hey, little hero, this reminds me of the Episode 912. We were surrounded. The Kelp-Thing was to our right and their broccoli was on the side. But if there was one thing I remember, it was how to forget.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is good. Roll the film.
Mermaid Man: The rain in Spain stays mainly on the...space! The final countdown. Stick to the...stick to the...Lou, my darling! Lou! [falls on ground] Now get out there and finish this movie, kid. [cut to the Krusty Krab at night. Mr. Krabs is weeping]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, why are you weeping?
Mr. Krabs: I closed early for your movie. Where are the paying customers?! You promised a full house!
SpongeBob: And here comes the filling! [fan club comes rushing into the Krusty Krab] The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club. I knew you'd come to see the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie.
Club Leader: Actually, the real movie was sold out. I'll take 200 tickets, please. [hands Mr. Krabs stack of money and he stuffs it into his pocket]
Mr. Krabs: Now, this is what I call a happy ending.
Barnacle Boy: [movie starts] Well, our big moment, us up on the big screen. [Mermaid Man is sleeping]
SpongeBob: [on-screen, playing with a toy car near a box-made fort with the word "LOX" on it] Fort Lox: home to over five billion Krabby Patties. [SpongeBob and Patrick each grab a canister of popcorn while watching the movie. SpongeBob uses his tongue and Patrick sucks all the popcorn out of his canister] What evil mastermind would dare infiltrate this fortified fort and make off with its treasure? [the patty vault is opened and a piece of kelp on strings comes down] It is I, Kelp-Thing! Do what I do!
Mermaid Man: [on-screen] Stop! You can't do that forbidden.
SpongeBob: [on-screen as Kelp-Thing] Watch me!
Mermaid Man: Prepare to feel my wrath, you foul villain. [Sandy comes in as Mermaid Man's stunt double and fights Kelp Thing. Then Mermaid Man shows up on screen again] You may have won the Krabby Patties, but the battle rages on. [real crabs are fighting] Mermaidmanacle Boy, unite! [both put rings together. Then 'FIN' comes on-screen]

​

SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [cheering] Yay! [the other Bikini Bottomites are disappointed]
Mermaid Man: Well, kid, you showed the world that even though our steps may have been slowed, we still have a little action left in these heroic old bones. [bone breaks]
Barnacle Boy: Well, at least some of them. [all four of them laugh]


[SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are running through Jellyfish Fields laughing trying to capture jellyfish]
Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] You're it! [both laugh]
SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] You're it! [both laugh. Patrick runs off] Wait, Pat, you're it! [notices a sign a few yards away and yelps. Patrick laughs, not paying attention] The sign!
Patrick: Huh? [tries to read it as he is running] Duuhh... aaann... ger... [crashes through the sign and falls off the cliff] cliff!
SpongeBob: Patrick! [runs down the cliff to Patrick] Let me help you out of there, buddy! [grabs a starfish shaped head out of the ground. When he notices it's just a head, he screams] Is the rest of you down there?
Patrick: [walks up to SpongeBob with no head attached to his body] The rest of me is up here.
SpongeBob: Whew, you had me worried there, buddy. [laughs] Here's your head. [attaches the head onto Patrick and laughs. Picture of inside Patrick's head shows a plug plugging into an outlet. Gears and cranks start up. Patrick gets a spark or two from his head]
Patrick: I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.
SpongeBob: Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'! [takes out two jellyfish nets. Hands a net to Patrick] Go ahead, you get first crack.
Patrick: [jellyfish floats by] Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.
SpongeBob: Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.
Patrick: Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.
SpongeBob: Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets! C'mon, Patrick! [captures a jellyfish] Look, buddy, I captured one!
Patrick: Yes... [shows SpongeBob a notebook with a Davinci-style jellyfish drawn] I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner. [frees the jellyfish from SpongeBob's net]
SpongeBob: Okay...what do you wanna do?
Patrick: Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.
SpongeBob: Pretty.
Patrick: Yes, quite.
SpongeBob: Fragile.
Patrick: Indeed.
SpongeBob: [jumps at Patrick three times] C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun!
Patrick: Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?
SpongeBob: I was thinking more like jumping rope, [jumps rope with his arms] 1-legged races [one leg goes inside his body and he hops on his remaining leg], or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. [jumps into a hermit-crab shell and blows bubbles]
Patrick: Doesn't feel like fun.
SpongeBob: [pops out of the shell] How about some jokes? [Patrick sighs] Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?
Patrick: You can't strum a jellyfish.
SpongeBob: Yes! [laughs. Patrick grabs a jellyfish and strums its tentacles]
Patrick: Oh my, look at the time. I really must be going. [walks off]
SpongeBob: What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon. [at Patrick's house where Patrick is doing some scientific work] Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing?
Patrick: Just studying this amazing subspecies.
Plankton: [through a microscope] I'll show you subspecies!
SpongeBob: Wanna visit Squidward?
Patrick: Well, since I am finished with my work, I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits. [now at Squidward's house where Squidward is playing his clarinet. He hears SpongeBob and Patrick come in and prepares to yell at them] I'd recognize that piece anywhere! Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67, "Symphony in Blue."
Squidward: [very confused] Patrick?
Patrick: It's a beautiful piece. Execution needs some work. [walks over to the piano] May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale.
Squidward: Wow! I never thought to do it like that.
Patrick: Well, that is because you rarely think.
SpongeBob: How do you know so much about music?
Patrick: A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance. [inhales] Ah.
SpongeBob: Does that include... [burps] belch-talk-ing?
Patrick: [waving his hand in front of his face] Mr. SquarePants, I find your humor vulgar.
Squidward: I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick! Do you think you can be my musical mentor?
SpongeBob: Uhh, guys?
Patrick: Let's take it from the top. [Squidward plays, badly] Not so excellent, Squidward. Let me demonstrate the proper technique. [looks at clarinet with spit covered all over the mouth piece] On second thought, practice makes perfect. Let's begin. [SpongeBob comes up playing his musical nose as a flute] Thank you, my good chap. Unfortunately, this is a solo piece for clarinet only. And 1, 2, 3, 4... [Squidward plays more. SpongeBob frowns and walks out. Patrick covers his ears since Squidward's playing is still terrible] Stop! Enough! [walks out] Find yourself a new mentor!
SpongeBob: Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub.
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not.
SpongeBob: Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap! [blows a bubble that pops on Patrick's face]
Patrick: [wiping his face] No, thanks again.
SpongeBob: Well, maybe later we can play pirates.
Patrick: Robert, my dear, it's no use. We've just grown apart.
SpongeBob: What? What do you mean?
Patrick: I know we've had fun in the past, but we're just not compatible anymore. It's time we went our separate ways...such is life.
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] But Patrick, you're my best friend!
Patrick: I know it's hard, but brace up, chap.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Patrick: Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Think fondly of me, Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Goodbye... Mr... Best friend! [sobs. At Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob rings her doorbell] Sandy, you there? I need some professional help. [Sandy and Patrick are heard laughing inside] Patrick?
Sandy: Well, Pat, the new you gets an A+.
Patrick: Why, thank you, Sandra. I find your intellect rather stimulating as well.
Sandy: Oh, really? Well, thanks. [SpongeBob cries then walks away from the treedome, at a chalkboard, there's an equation on it] Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?
Patrick: [changes formula] You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient. Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought.
Sandy: [angrily puts her hands on her hips] What do you mean by that, Patrick?
Patrick: I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations.
Sandy: Are you suggesting I'm dumb?
Patrick: I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'.
Sandy: I think you'd better leave.
Patrick: I was only trying to help. [walks off]
Sandy: I don't need your kind of help, Mr. know-it-all! I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!
SpongeBob: [sitting on his chair at home, crying] I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!
Patrick: [sitting on his chair at home] Surrounded by knowledge and no one to share it with. No one I can call friend. Who's that old chap I used to run with? [notices a book on the table next to him called 'MY FRIEND SPONGEBOB'] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [looks at his 'MY FRIEND PATRICK' book] Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories. [SpongeBob looks at several pictures of him and Patrick together, as SpongeBob begins to cry another picture is shown, it's revealed that Patrick is the one who put a tear on the last picture]
Patrick: Aww, the glory days. Why have we grown apart? I must apply all that I know to solve this problem! [looks at x-rays of him and SpongeBob's head, meditates on top of his rock, studies Squidward, reads a book. He puts the book down and shows his bloodshot eyes] What could it be? [applies a chemical on his head and grows hair] What's different? Ah! [tears out his hair] What?! I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!
SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Coming... [opens door and gets kidnapped in a jellyfish net. Patrick is shown carrying the net over his shoulder with SpongeBob inside. SpongeBob pops out happily] Patrick, you're kidnapping me?
Patrick: Yes, I am.
SpongeBob: Yay! [jumps out of the net and writes "Yippie" in the air with bubble soap] What should we do?
Patrick: We are going to have fun, whatever the cost may be.
SpongeBob: Let's do this.
Patrick: Yes, let's have some fun.
SpongeBob: [jumping around] Oh, yeah!
Patrick: [jumping around] Oh, absolutely! [now riding on a shell down a mountain] Are you quite sure I found this activity to be fun?
SpongeBob: Yeah! [screams with enjoyment. Shell lunges them into the sand] That was fun, huh Patrick?
Patrick: [Swallows a mouth-full of sand] When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.
Patrick: That's it! [runs off]
SpongeBob: That's what? Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha...an...nge! [falls off the cliff]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Hold on, buddy! [takes Patrick out of the ground] There ya go. [notices he has no head and screams] Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again! [searches around some coral] Not back there. [checks under a rock] Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh, poor headless Patrick! [turns around and runs into Patrick making his head pop out] Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different?
Patrick: Quite unchanged, actually.
SpongeBob: I guess we'll never have fun together again.
Patrick: You said you found my dislodged cranial cap last time.
SpongeBob: Yes.
Patrick: Where exactly did you find it?
SpongeBob: Uhh, it was right here.
Patrick: Hmmm, impossible! If I landed here, the trajectory of my dismembered skull would cause it to come to rest, not there, but here, exactly five meters due north.
SpongeBob: But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over... [sign says 'Brain Coral Field'] Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy. [blows off the Poison Sea Urchins off Patrick's head] Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and sophisticated to be my friend again?
Patrick: Knowledge can never replace friendship. I prefer to be an idiot!
SpongeBob: Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal. [Patrick takes off his coral head and SpongeBob puts his old one back on] Patrick? Say something, Patrick.
Patrick: [burps] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're back!
Patrick: Patrick, you're back. [both laugh, then pull out their jellyfish nets, make oo-loo-loo sounds, and run off into the sunset]


[Squidward has blonde hair and is playing the clarinet while the crowd is cheering for him]
Tina-Fran: Squidward, we love you!
Audience Member #2: I love you, Squidward. You're my favorite! [Squidward laughs as he does a crowd surf. His alarm goes off and wakes him up]
Squidward: Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous. [Plays a few notes on his clarinet] Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Time for another glorious day at work. [winks at his tie, the tie winks back] Good morning, Squidward! [walks down the street with Squidward] And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?
Squidward: I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob.
SpongeBob: See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this?
Sandy: Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye.
SpongeBob: Ooh, that sounds fancy.
Sandy: Let me show you how it works. [puts an apple in the transporter]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [apple disappears] Where'd it go?
Sandy: Just where you think it would be. [apple appears on Mrs. Puff's desk]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
SpongeBob: Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! [goes into transporter]
Sandy: Hold on tight.
SpongeBob: [transporter starts] Gee, Sandy, this sure feels...
Squidward: [walking up to the Krusty Krab] Well, here we go again. [as he reaches for the door, SpongeBob appears and Squidward's arm is attached through SpongeBob's body]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! [laughs. Sandy's remote is going haywire]
Sandy: What's going on with this thing? [SpongeBob and Squidward get transported back to Sandy's machine] What in tarnation? [gasps. SpongeBob and Squidward are mutated into one body]
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy!
Squidward: I'm not sure what it is, but something seems different about me.
SpongeBob: Yeah, me too.
Squidward: Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together. [tries to detach himself, but fails] This is horrible! I have my clarinet recital tomorrow!
SpongeBob: Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever.
Squidward: [screams] Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated!
Sandy: Well, I wish I knew how.
Squidward: Well, you have to do something! I can't stay stuck to him!
Sandy: Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter.
Squidward: Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it.
Sandy: Well, here goes nothing. [transports to Bikini Bottom Elementary]
Mable: All right, children. Today's Timmy's birthday. You know what that means. Ready, Timmy? [opens present. SpongeBob and Squidward rise up from the box, still mutated together. Mable screams as SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again]
Doctor: Congratulations, Mrs. Smith. You gave birth to a healthy baby boy.
Mrs. Smith: May I see my baby?
Doctor: Of course. [baby appears as SpongeBob &amp; Squidward mutated into one body again. Mrs. Smith screams as they are transported again]
One-Eyed Monster: I've been in love with you ever since I first laid my eye on you. [both monsters kiss. SpongeBob and Squidward appear between them] Hey, baby, what's your name? [SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again. The lady monster slaps the one-eyed monster's face and leaves]
Squidward: It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same.
Sandy: Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage.
Squidward: Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this.
Sandy: I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up.
SpongeBob: Together forever.
Squidward: Misery. [later, SpongeBob and Squidward are riding a bike to work] SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll drive.
Squidward: [Squidward's head bumps against the wheel of the bike] Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [both enter the Krusty Krab riding the bike. The bike crashes into the boat and they fly through the kitchen window]
Customer #1: I gotta lay off the hot sauce.
Mr. Krabs: [enters kitchen] What in blazes is going on in here?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What are you two doing laying around? Get to work.
Squidward: If you say so. [as they stand up, Mr. Krabs freaks out]
Mr. Krabs: Egad! What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, cap'n!
Squidward: Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?
SpongeBob: Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon.
Squidward: I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register. [stretches his head through the kitchen window] Whew. Can I help you?
Customer #2: Can I get two Krabby Patties, please?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: Two Krabby Patties coming right up. [notices the buns are out of reach] I can't... reach the buns.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's the holdup?!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it.
Mr. Krabs: Time is money, boy.
SpongeBob: Time is money. Right. [reaches bun] Hello, bun. At last we meet. [Squidward can't hold the cash register. His head flies through the kitchen window, onto the grill and crashes into SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth. [pushes them out the restaurant] And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out.
SpongeBob: Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other.
Squidward: That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile! Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. [plays clarinet as they walk past a surfer]
Surfer: Whoa, rock on, freaky bro!
Squidward: Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us.
Sandy: Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'.
Squidward: Hello, Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night.
Sandy: Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet.
Squidward: What'd you say?
Sandy: I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe? [Squidward pushes Sandy's air helmet]
Squidward: What?!? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak! [SpongeBob smiles] Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show!
Sandy: Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on. [Squidward and SpongeBob stretch through their front doors, but can't walk much further, so their houses collide together]
Squidward: Of course. [at the clarinet recital] Oh, my. [not an empty seat in the house] Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there.
SpongeBob: Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar!
Squidward: Superstar?
SpongeBob: Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen!
Squidward: You're right! The show must go on!
Announcer: Ladies and gentlefish, Bikini Bottom's Community Rec Center is proud to present: Squidward Tentacles. [curtain rises to Squidward wearing a big cape like clothing. Squidward starts playing and everyone begins to hate it]
Evelyn: Honey, I'm scared. [the crowd continues to dislike Squidward playing the clarinet, the cape comes off as a nail tears it. SpongeBob starts to see the crowd, the crowd gasps]
SpongeBob: Uhh, hi.
Wobbles: Whoa. Rock on, freaky bro! Yeah. Whoo! [crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: Wow, they really liked it.
Mr. Krabs: [laughing] There you go, Squiddy!
Squidward: They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And... [smells the air] ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating.
Sandy: Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time.
SpongeBob and Squidward: Sandy?
Sandy: One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. [SpongeBob and Squidward try to tell Sandy not to blast them, but was too late, she blasts the ray at Squidward and SpongeBob and it separates them. Crowd gasps]
Squidward: [SpongeBob gives him back his clarinet] Hmph. [plays clarinet off-key making SpongeBob cheer for him, but the audience hates it as they block their ears, Old Man Jenkins faints off his chair]
Mary: I think I'm going to be sick! [Squidward blows his clarinet at Billy, which blows his skin off and shows his skeleton]
Billy: Ah, I'm out of here!
Squidward: Huh, no, wait. Wait! [everyone leaves] Oh, my one moment of fame... gone. [grabs the Molecular Separator Ray] There's got to be some way to reverse this. [pushes the button over and over]
Sandy: No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device!
SpongeBob: Squidward, I wouldn't--! [laser blasts into the final scene]
Therapist: So, what seems to be the problem, Mr. Tentacles?
Squidward: It all started when I was born. [camera zooms out to show Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, SpongeBob, and Squidward deformed and misshapen into a liquid ball of the fused characters]


[SpongeBob and Squidward are walking down the road towards the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long! So...
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: They weren't overcooked at all!
Squidward: SpongeBob, look! [picks him up and turns him around where we are shown a tall building]
SpongeBob: Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!
SpongeBob: Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request." Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger! [takes out a whole burger from inside his body] If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born.
Squidward: Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish. [jellyfish stings Squidward on the head, forming a bump] See?!
SpongeBob: [pushes the bump in and it goes to the other side of Squidward's head] Ooh!
Mr. Krabs: Come inside. [now inside Krusty Towers] Isn't it beautiful?
Squidward: Where are all the new hotel employees? [Mr. Krabs throws uniforms onto Squidward &amp; SpongeBob. Dave enters]
Mr. Krabs: My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in. [walks behind desk] Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request."
Dave: Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles.
Mr. Krabs: If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service.
Dave: [looks at watch] Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch. [sighs and leaves]
Squidward: Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Squidward, you man the front desk.
Patrick: I'd like a Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service.
Patrick: Okay, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?
Squidward: Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?
Patrick: Sometimes I just need to get away from it all. [rings bell] Wow, this hotel has everything!
Squidward: [takes bell] Gimme that! Now sign the register.
Patrick: I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study! [cries]
Squidward: Patrick, all you have to do is write your name.
Patrick: Oh, okay. [takes pen] Do you mind?! [Squidward turns around so Patrick starts writing. Squidward peeks] Don't look! [Squidward turns around] Done! [Patrick has drawn a giant monster doodle of himself fighting three attack planes.]
Squidward: Close enough. Here's your room key.
Patrick: I'll need some help with my bags.
Squidward: How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!
Patrick: This is a hotel?
Squidward: [groans] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?
Squidward: Take Patrick and his bags to his room.
Patrick: What about my Krabby Patty?
Squidward: And bring him a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty. [he exits]
Squidward: Oh, Mr Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor? [mocking Squidward] I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
Squidward: Fine. Let's go, Patrick. [has struggle with Patrick's bags as he is walking up to the elevator]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the elevator] This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator. [Squidward walks to the other elevator, which turns out to be stairs. He grumbles because of this. Squidward walks up stairs as Patrick gets off the guest elevator]
Squidward: What's in these bags, rocks? [bag opens, spilling out rocks] Hey, these are rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?
Patrick: I don't tell you how to live your life!
Squidward: Well, here's your room.
Patrick: Wow.
Squidward: Enjoy your stay.
Patrick: Squidward, wait! [takes out a rock from his pocket and gives it to Squidward as a tip] Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from.
SpongeBob: Your Krabby Patty, sir. [Squidward attempting to throw the rock that Patrick gave to him as a tip] Hey, Squidward, cool rock.
Patrick: Hold on a second, SpongeBob. [hands SpongeBob a dollar, Squidward makes a surprise face, then scowls] Here you are, my good man.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you, Patrick!
Patrick: There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend [Squidward looks at his rock and becomes frustrated] Squidward!
Squidward: What now?!
Patrick: I don't like crusts on my sandwich!
Squidward: It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?
Patrick: Peel it.
Squidward: [peels the skin off the bun angrily] Happy? [Patrick inhales the patty]
SpongeBob: Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered.
Patrick: Could you do one more thing for me?
Squidward: Why don't you ask SpongeBob?
Patrick: Good idea, Squidward!
SpongeBob: How may I serve you, sir?
Patrick: I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.
SpongeBob: Oh, yes, sir! [both of them eat a bunch of Krabby Patties. As Squidward heads down the employee elevator, Mr. Krabs is on the phone]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help.
Squidward: What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?
Mr. Krabs: He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.
[Squidward is unclogging the toilet when he unclogs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward! [Squidward puts him back in the toilet. Patrick flushes]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!
Mr. Krabs: He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Deny no guests! [phone rings] Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there.
Squidward: [Scene transits to bubbles floating from a bathtub] A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!
Patrick: Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean.
Squidward: That's it! I've had enough!
Patrick: Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!
Mr. Krabs: [Squidward comes out of the guest elevator] Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!
Squidward: Not anymore. I quit. [Squidward throws his uniform on Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Quit? You can't quit. [Squidward walks out naked and reenters with Hawaiian-styled clothes. Squidward rings the bell] Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!
Squidward: One room, please. On the top floor.
Mr. Krabs: What do you think you're doing?
Squidward: I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where "we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request."
Mr. Krabs: I don't have to rent you a room!
Squidward: I've got cash.
Mr. Krabs: Oh... here's your room key.
Squidward: SpongeBob, carry my things to my room.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, guest sir. [turns legs into rockets and blasts off through the ceiling]
Squidward: [talking to Mr. Krabs] And you can carry me to my room.
Mr. Krabs: And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken.
Squidward: The plaque. [plaque is shown. Mr. Krabs has just finished carrying Squidward from the employee elevator] Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee.
SpongeBob: Your room, sir.
Squidward: And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hair.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] You've got to be kidding me!
Squidward: And I want it here in five seconds.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [runs off and comes back with a Krabby Patty in less than two seconds] Here you are, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it.
Squidward: Oh, I'm not going to eat this. You are.
Mr. Krabs: What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!
SpongeBob: Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward. [eats Krabby Patty, then spits it out, showing his tongue covered with toenails and nose hair. Squidward laughs] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese.
Patrick: [everything in Patrick's room is covered in cheese because apparently he asked for his room to be covered with cheese earlier] Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: [phone rings] What is it, Squidward?
Squidward: Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.
Mr. Krabs: [at Squidward's room] Here's your homemade cookies.
Squidward: [tries one and spits it out] These don't taste anything like mom used to make!
Mr. Krabs: Well, how did your mother make 'em?
Squidward: How should I know?! Ask my mother! [slams the door]
Mrs. Tentacles: [doorbell rings] Hello? [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are in ski masks]
Mr. Krabs: [trying to get a big sack in the trunk, but the door won't close] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob hits the sack with a shovel, but the trunk still won't close]
SpongeBob: No good, Mr. Krabs.
Mrs. Tentacles: Allow me, boy. [closes the trunk door]
Mr. Krabs: Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk...
SpongeBob: There's room for you to sit up front!
Mrs. Tentacles: Let's go bake some cookies, boys.
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: [in Squidward's room where Squidward is sampling the cookies] Well?
Squidward: I'm impressed! These are just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.
Mr. Krabs: So you're all taken care of?
Squidward: Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice.
Mr. Krabs: What?
Squidward: "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request." [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob change the room to a blue theme, a modern theme, a country theme, a torture theme, and then back to the original] Perfect!
Mr. Krabs: This room is exactly the same as when we started!
Squidward: Nothing like getting back to the basics.
Mr. Krabs: Let's get out of here, SpongeBob!
Squidward: Oh, before you leave, I want to go swimming.
Mr. Krabs: The pool's out back!
Squidward: Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim. [big swimming pool is now inside the room] Come on in, the water's fine. [SpongeBob jumps in]
Mr. Krabs: Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?
Squidward: Nope, that's it.
Mr. Krabs: You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!
Squidward: No, I'm good.
SpongeBob: Me, too.
Patrick: Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place is fancy! [gets on diving board] Cannonball! [jumps in, but the pool collapses the hotel back into the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [at hospital with the gang] Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start.
Patrick: That was a hotel?
Nurse: Your bill, sir.
Mr. Krabs: $15,000?! [he then acts as if he is having a heart attack]
Squidward: You're not going to have a heart attack, are you?
Mr. Krabs: Not at these prices! Forget hotels. This hospital rack is where the money is!
Patrick: This is a hospital?
Mr. Krabs: Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Hooray!
Squidward: [plaintively] Oh, boy.


[At Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
Mr. Fitz: Morning, Mrs. Puff. I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know, your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusually large amount of failings from this classroom.
Mrs. Puff: That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class.
Mr. Fitz: Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times. [shows folder with a bunch of files]
Mrs. Puff: You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable.
Mr. Fitz: We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher.
SpongeBob: Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?
Mr. Fitz: Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced.
Mrs. Puff: [in the boat with SpongeBob and Mr. Fitz] Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating?
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Seat-belt-aroony. One second. [gets tangled in seat-belt then squeezes self through. Mr. Fitz writes on his notepad]
Mrs. Puff: Then what do you do?
SpongeBob: Start the engine?
Mrs. Puff: Yes.
SpongeBob: [starts the boat] Now what do I do?
Mrs. Puff: Drive the boat. [SpongeBob drives into a boat]
SpongeBob: Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you failed.
SpongeBob: I failed?
Mr. Fitz: It's not you that failed, SpongeBob. It's Mrs. Puff that's failed you. You are relieved of your teaching duties.
Mrs. Puff: I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore? [starts laughing louder and louder] No more... SpongeBob?! I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life. [flies away] Free at last! Free at last!
SpongeBob: [in classroom] I got Mrs. Puff fired. [banging and crashing]
Roderick: Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor. [he smashes Mrs. Puff's nameplate] No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking.
Nat: Does that mean... [Roderick throws Nat through the door]
Roderick: Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon? [All the students keep silent]
Monroe: Uhh, I'll eat one. [all gasp. Monroe walks to Roderick]
Roderick: Pick your favorite. [Monroe takes one and eats it] How's it taste?
Monroe: It's a delightful taste sensation.
Roderick: No eating in my classroom! [throws Monroe through another door] Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class... [everyone but SpongeBob run out] Looks like you're the man, Sponge.
SpongeBob: I am?
Roderick: [outside] Do you wanna learn how to drive or what?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive [jumps in the boat]
Roderick: What do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob: Ready for my test, sir.
Roderick: [takes SpongeBob out of the boat] You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first. [shows roads will all sorts of obstacles] This is [the] most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it.
SpongeBob: Crawl?
Roderick: Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. [SpongeBob crawls forward]
SpongeBob: Left turn. [turns left] Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!
Roderick: Keep your eyes on the road, cadet.
SpongeBob: Pebble! [crawls faster and more out of control. Gets the pebble stuck in his hand and goes on screaming] Oh whoa! [SpongeBob's butt gets setted on fire rolls down the obstacle course then into the air, out of the water, then back down where the instructor catches him as he screams] Oh whoa! [he stops screaming] Whew! [falls with only his arm taken off]
Roderick: I'm ashamed of you, cadet. [removes the pebble from SpongeBob's hand] Tripped up by a wee pebble. [crushes the pebble] What are you suppose to be learning in my class?
SpongeBob: How to drive, sir?
Roderick: Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl. Then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl. [bends SpongeBob's arm] I want you to crawl! [puts SpongeBob's arm back]
SpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir!
Roderick: Now get out there! [SpongeBob crawls around a hole then his instructor takes off his shoes and socks; he wiggles his toes after his shoes are forcibly taken off, and carries the instructor on his back. Then he stops at a stop sign, and runs in and out of some radioactive waste] Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out. [hands SpongeBob a wrench] Here, go take that boat apart. [SpongeBob takes the boat apart] I'm impressed, son. Put it back together again!
SpongeBob: [laughs] That'll be easy.
Roderick: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh... [laughs] I might need a couple minutes. [later, the instructor is sleeping] It's ready, sarge! [SpongeBob has re-assembled the boat into a rocket ship.]
Roderick: Jumpin' jellyfish... [the rocket blasts off]
SpongeBob: Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians! [crashes through a lot of pedestrians] So, umm, how'd I do?
Roderick: How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... HOW YOU DID!
SpongeBob: Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?
Roderick: Not quite. [puts blindfold on SpongeBob] Now do it blindfolded.
[SpongeBob crashes through another pedestrian off-screen.]
Narrator: Several days later...
SpongeBob: 1003, 1004, 1005. [stops] Ooh, pebble #143. [steps over pebble] Ha! You will not trip me up again, pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008. [old lady pedestrian pops up] Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13.
Roderick: Congratulations. You're ready to get behind the wheel.
SpongeBob: Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm... [runs into a pole]
Roderick: [now in boat] Let's see what I taught you, laddy.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [drives boat] Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball. [SpongeBob continues] Nice boy.
Roderick: Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead. [SpongeBob parallel parks] Very good. [now at real exam] Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts. [puts on seatbelt with no problem]
Roderick: Excellent work, cadet. What's next?
SpongeBob: Step 2 would be... ignite engine.
Roderick: Step 3?
SpongeBob: Step 3 would be... [takes out blindfold and his eyes shrink] ...engage blindfold.
Roderick: What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal.
SpongeBob: But I can't do it without a blindfold.
Roderick: Drive, boy! Drive!
[SpongeBob kicks down on the gas pedal and the boat is off. At the first turn is a giant red canister labeled "GAS". SpongeBob fails to make the right turn and instead crashes right into the gas can, obliterating the boating school faculty in a mushroom-radius explosion, and sending debris from the boating school sign, etc., flying everywhere. As the debris begins to clear, the boat flies into the air and goes soaring.]
Roderick: Mayday! Mayday! You're off course. [boat drives into 2 buildings then underground. Spurts out from a fire hydrant. Then crashes through a bakery and into a field where Mrs. Puff is painting the scenery]
Mrs. Puff: Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff notices the boat and attempts to paint something really quick. When boat runs into her, the painting shows SpongeBob, the instructor, and Mr. Fitz fearing their lives]
Roderick: The brake son!
SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir. [takes brake apart] There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts.
Roderick: I'm gonna stop this thing. Tell my wife I love her. [jumps in front of the boat in an attempt to stop it] Come get some! [boat runs over him]
SpongeBob: Man down. Man down. [SpongeBob drives into the city and into each building] Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now. [boat drives out of the now destroyed city, and then cuts to SpongeBob driving while wearing Patrick's pants over his eyes] I can't see! I can't see!
Patrick: My pants!
SpongeBob: Hey, I can't see! [dodges traffic and pedestrians as Mrs. Puff screams. Parallel parks] Did I pass?
Mr. Fitz: Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have.
Patrick: [takes pants off SpongeBob's head] The nerve of some people.
Mr. Fitz: Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again. Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again.
SpongeBob: [at boating school] Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm "unteachable".
Mrs. Puff: It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back. [sniffles, holds up a burnt, charred object] And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion, [voice breaking] so it's as if you never failed.
SpongeBob: I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff. [shows name tag] I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time.
[Mrs. Puff puts her head down on her desk and begins to sob quietly, and the name tag shatters as the episode ends.]


Flying Dutchman: [Green fog passes by his ship while he steers his ship] Curse this cursed, ghostly fog. I can barely see past me own nose. [gas is sprayed in his eyes] Urrgh! [Screams after noticing the unseen cliff, only seen seconds after] [then the ship is split in half after it runs into a cliff. The Flying Dutchman falls down the cliff] Arrgh! [Continues falling, falling through a basketball hoop before hitting the ground. The ship falls onto of him into pieces then he crawls out] Me ship. [his ship turns into dust. His hat floats gently down, and he picks it up. He then gets out his cell phone to dial  the Roadside Assistance] Hello, Roadside Assistance? I've got a bit of a flat! My location where I'll be staying? Business or residence? [sees SpongeBob go into his house] Residence. [SpongeBob is walking through his house as The Flying Dutchman comes up and scares him through the floor] Argh!
SpongeBob: The Flying Dutchman! [melts into a puddle inside his pants] What are you doing in my house?
Flying Dutchman: I'm stuck here while my ship is being repaired. Until then, I'm here to haunt ya! [laughs maniacally, and ghostly snake "tongues" come out with evil grins. SpongeBob screams and runs to Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! [knocks on the door] Squidward! Help! [Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob continues to knock but on Squidward's face]
Squidward: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ee! Ow! Ee! Ooh!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob pants] Squidward, you have to help me! There's a gh-gh-gh, a ghost in my house!
Squidward: [muffled and grabs SpongeBob's arm] SpongeBob, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't believe in ghosts and I never liked you! [closes door]
SpongeBob: PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! [Patrick opens up his rock] Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch... [Patrick closes his rock] ...man. [Gary meows loudly] Gary! [opens his door and gasps] Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!
Flying Dutchman: Aw, I just wanted to pet the little guy. [SpongeBob shows teary eyes, then snaps out of it. Gary looks relaxed] There, there. Dutchie's not gonna hurt ya. I love me a good snail. [SpongeBob smiles sheepishly, the Flying Dutchman eats Gary.]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob screams and rips off the sides of his head]
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob looks down] Meow!
SpongeBob: [relieved and happy] Gary!
Flying Dutchman: [cackles] Nothing better than giving a good scare! Argh! [laughs]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Gary. [fire surrounds the Flying Dutchman and SpongeBob]
Flying Dutchman: [Talking scarily...] Don't get too comfortable! [cut to SpongeBob walking up to his house, which is set on fire, making it look like a monster house. His house makes an evil laugh. SpongeBob does not get scared, but he looks like he's upset. Cut to SpongeBob's bedtime]
SpongeBob: Goodnight, Gary. [They both sleep. Suddenly, his nose starts to itch so a yellow tentacle scratches it. SpongeBob pulls off his blanket to reveal him as an octopus. He screams while the Flying Dutchman laughs. Cut to SpongeBob opening up the refrigerator to a monster popping out and scaring him. Both laugh. Cut to SpongeBob looking in the mirror when in the reflection only, a monster eats him. He sighs and walks off. Cut to him eating cereal, which are eyeballs, and they blink. He sighs and walks off again]
Flying Dutchman: Hmm? [SpongeBob walks up and opens a drawer then sighs and takes out the skeleton in it. As he's walking out, a monster pops out from underneath the floor and tries to scare SpongeBob, but it doesn't. The monster turns into a giant cockroach, a baby, a clown, which laughs evilly in SpongeBob's face, then Sherlock Holmes, who smokes a pipe, then he spits it out and screams, and even SpongeBob's head. It then grimaces, and dozens of spiders come out, but still nothing is working. Dutchman's head pops out] Hmm?
SpongeBob: Um, Dutchie? Is this gonna be much longer?
Flying Dutchman: Why aren't you freakin' out, lad?
SpongeBob: Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks.
Flying Dutchman: What are you trying to say?
SpongeBob: Eeeh.
Flying Dutchman: I know when I'm washed up. I've been doing the same material for years! Scaring is a young man's game. It's time to give up the ghost; no pun intended.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all.
Flying Dutchman: Don't lie to me!
SpongeBob: You just gotta scare someone other than me.
Flying Dutchman: Hmm... [scene cuts to the Bikini Bottom Mattress Discount]
Fish: Mind if I test it out? [hops onto the mattress] Yeah, this does feel comfortable. [doorbell rings]
Mattress Salesman: Would you excuse me for a moment? [The fish on the mattress falls asleep as the Flying Dutchman tries to scare him. First he scares normally, then scares by opening his mouth to reveal a skeleton. Nothing is working]
Flying Dutchman: Grr! [Shakes the guy continuously] Raargh! Raargh! Move! Raargh! [Puts the guy back to his mattress] Ah, forget it. [Mattress Salesman comes back]
Mattress Salesman: So, what do you think? [the sleeping fish screams. Scene cuts to The Flying Dutchman trying to scare a little girl jumping rope. The jump rope hits him back]
Flying Dutchman: It's official; I'm not scary anymore.
SpongeBob: Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all.
Flying Dutchman: Maybe I just need a break. Take some time off, you know?
SpongeBob: Sure, relax a little.
Flying Dutchman: Maybe stay with a friend for a while. On a comfy couch in a pineapple. Just for a little while longer? 'Til I get back on my feet?
Narrator: 6 Months Later...
SpongeBob: [walks into his house] Hey, champ! How's it... [screams]
Red Ghost: Turn it up...
Purple Ghost: Turn the knob up.
Yellow Ghost: Whoo!
Flying Dutchman: Who'd guess we have so much in common? You like teddy bears; I like teddy bears. You like ponies; I like ponies!
Nancy: Is that a wedding ring?
Flying Dutchman: Oh, this? Oh, it's nothing. [takes it off and throws it away, landing on SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: What is going on around here?
Flying Dutchman: Come on, SpongeBob, don't be a stick in the mud!
Purple Ghost: Look out below! [riding on a motorcycle down the stairs and crashing into SpongeBob's wall] How was that?
Flying Dutchman: Even better the third time.
SpongeBob: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Everyone, get out!
Flying Dutchman: Alrighty, boys, party's over. [to Nancy] Time to scoot, honey. [everyone leaves, except SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman]
SpongeBob: Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?
Flying Dutchman: Well, it is comfy.
SpongeBob: Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!
Flying Dutchman: Ah, you're right, SpongeBob. I'm pathetic.
SpongeBob: Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now. [SpongeBob puts a tape into the VCR]
Flying Dutchman: What in barnacles is it?
SpongeBob: A journey into self-awareness. [on the tape is a fish that uses a square hammer on a gong. An eagle flies through some mountains and calls out. Then some fish, wearing robes and roller skating, skate in a straight line]
Fish: The power within. The power within. [last fish holds a medallion up]
Fish #2: [whispering] The power within. The power within. The power within. The power within. [the man multiples into a blue, red, and green being of himself] The power within. The power within. [picks up some dirt] The power within! Yeah.
Flying Dutchman: That was beautiful!
SpongeBob: Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious. [cut to later that night where an elderly fish lady is walking by some seaweed, where SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman are hiding behind] Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there?
Flying Dutchman: What are you kidding me? Scaring her is too easy.
SpongeBob: Now that's the Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action.
Flying Dutchman: No problemo, compadre. [thunder claps while the Dutchman screams at the old lady] Yargh!
Old Lady: Lonnie is that you?
Flying Dutchman: What? No! 'Tis I, the ominous Flying Dutchman! [screams]
Old Lady: Lonnie, there's this great new product called toothpaste. I think you should try it. [cut to SpongeBob flying on the Flying Dutchman's back. They spot a gym]
Flying Dutchman: Let's hit it. [The Flying Dutchman, goes through the wall, but SpongeBob does not, smashing into the wall. Inside, Larry the Lobster is lifting weights. Then he looks into the mirror]
Larry: Dude, look at your pecks! You're phenomenal! Truly a hard body. Look at those guns. [Flying Dutchman attempts to scare him. Larry gasps]
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Now he's got him.
Larry: My latissimus dorsi has gone flabby! I gotta get to a rolling machine. [leaves]
Flying Dutchman: Ah. It's no use, SpongeBob. I can't seem to scare anyone. Maybe people just don't believe in ghosts anymore.
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems! [whispers into the Flying Dutchman's ears] ...goblins...guilt trip... [scene cuts to Squidward's house where Squidward slips into his bunny slippers and walks to the mirror. When he picks up his powder, it floats by itself and applies itself onto Squidward.]
Squidward: Huh? [Green fog begins to appear and a voice is heard in the fog]
Mrs. Tentacles: Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: What's going on?
Mrs. Tentacles: Why haven't you called me?
Squidward: Mother?
Mrs. Tentacles: Why haven't you called your mother?
Squidward: [screams] Uh, Squiddums loves his mama.
Mrs. Tentacles: Why don't you call me then? Why don't you call me? Why don't you call me? [her face melts turning into a clarinet that plays music. The clarinet goes into one of Squidward's ears and out the other, literally]
Flying Dutchman: [through the clarinet] I heard you don't believe in ghosts!
Squidward: Ghosts?
Flying Dutchman: As in the Flying Dutchman! [tosses Squidward against the wall]
Squidward: There's no such thing as ghosts. No such thing.
Flying Dutchman: No such thing as ghosts? No such thing as ghosts?! You don't believe in ghosts?! [floor turns into liquid. Another ghost pops up and eats Squidward sending him into a light that spits him back into his house. A giant SpongeBob is sitting there breathing in and out really hard]
Squidward: SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's eyes twist around his head and spiders crawl out and reveal the Flying Dutchman. Flying Dutchman does a trick to think that he is pulling his finger off]
Flying Dutchman: Ooh, scary!
Squidward: No! No! That's impossible! [runs out of his house] Ghosts! Ghosts!
SpongeBob: [runs out of the closet] Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!
Flying Dutchman: And me confidence, too. Now I feel like I can scare the living criminy out of anybody! All thanks to you, my boy.
SpongeBob: And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.
Flying Dutchman: Actually, I have a confession, SpongeBob. My ship's been done for three months now. Well, it was nice roomin' with ya. [flies back up to his ship] Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I left you a little something something for all your trouble. Now, it's time for me to ruin more souls. [ships sails off. SpongeBob opens the package. A hand grabs him and pulls him in. SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Good Ol' Dutchie!


SpongeBob: [squeezes some shell wax onto Gary's shell] All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob grabs his nose and uses his back to wax Gary's shell]
SpongeBob: Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood. [opens Gary's shell and jumps in] Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Still? From New Year's Eve? [Gary blows his horn. SpongeBob sees something in his shell] What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary. [laughs] My favorite novelty t-shirt! [holds up a shirt that says I &lt;3 Krabby Patties. Doorbell rings] Oh, someone's here. [jumps out of Gary's shell]
Mailman: Special delivery for SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special? [hugs the mailman]
Mailman: Alright, do we have to go through this every time I give you your mail? Sheesh. [leaves]
SpongeBob: What could it be today, Gary?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [opens package] A videotape? [reads it] "You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants! [inserts videotape into VCR. Videotape plays]
Announcer: Karate Island: A serene and exotic location where nature and beauty abound, and hundreds of fighting styles collide in a wave of non-stop, pulsating, no-hold barred action! For centuries, the world's top karate artists have journeyed to this land to be crowned King of Karate.
SpongeBob: King of Karate?
Announcer: Now it's your turn...
Announcer 2: ...SpongeBob SquarePants.
Announcer: You've won an all-expense paid trip to Karate Island! Hi-yah! Where you'll be crowned this year's King of Karate!
SpongeBob: Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned... [shouts karate yells] King of Karate! [jumps to the door, leaving his arm in the ground] Whoo-hoo! [shouts karate yells]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.
Sandy: Karate Island? I've never heard of Karate Island.
SpongeBob: Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.
Sandy: But, my karate is better than yours by a country mile, and I've never been invited.
SpongeBob: Maybe your karate was the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.
Sandy: There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along with you and see if it's on the up-and-up.
SpongeBob: All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment. [laughs. Scene cuts to both in a boat heading towards Karate Island] Are we there yet?
Sandy: Yup. That's it over there.
SpongeBob: What make you think that's Karate Island? [big sign that says "Welcome to Karate Island" is pointing at the island]
Sandy: I don't know -- lucky guess? [three fish are waiting on top of some rocks for SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Sandy arrive on the island]
SpongeBob: Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.
Fish: Welcome to my island, SpongeBob-san. [bows]
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you. [bows]
Master Udon: I am Master Udon.
Sandy: Howdy, Master Udon, I'm Sandy Cheeks. I do a little karate, myself.
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty.
Sandy: Oh, brother.
Master Udon: Please, show me some of your moves, Master SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You hear that, Sandy? He called me "master." Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em. [three fighters appear]
Sandy: SpongeBob, your karate's not good enough to handle those sidewinders.
SpongeBob: Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister. [shouts karate yells at the first fighter. He falls to the ground] Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?
Sandy: Something smells like rancid rodeo around here. [all the fighters are knocked out]
Master Udon: Excellent. Truly, you are King of Karate.
SpongeBob: The one and only.
Master Udon: We must make ready for your coronation.
SpongeBob: I'm ready to be King of Karate! [gong sounds]
Master Udon: King of Karate-san, it is time for you to take your rightful place on your throne.
SpongeBob: My throne. [floats over to the throne]
Sandy: All right, Udon, I'm on to you. This place is as crooked as a dizzy sidewinder.
SpongeBob: [sitting on his throne] Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement. [claps twice] Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend. [chair is brought]
Sandy: SpongeBob, y'all are getting a bit wily.
SpongeBob: Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?
Sandy: Heck, I could karate you into a country fiddle with one paw tied behind my back.
SpongeBob: [laughs] But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.
Sandy: I'm getting off this crazy train! [mumbles]
Master Udon: Master, don't worry about her. She is missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime. [laughs] Let the coronation begin!
SpongeBob: Sandy's going to miss out, big time. [suddenly SpongeBob is chained down to the throne. Master Udon reaches into his robe and takes out a pen]
Sandy: That dang SpongeBob. Who does he think he is? I taught that yellow egomaniac everything he knows about fighting -- and that ain't much.
SpongeBob: No!
Sandy: SpongeBob's in trouble! [SpongeBob screams] SpongeBob is the "King of Karate". He doesn't need me. Eh, he can handle this himself.
SpongeBob: [in the distance] Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself.
Sandy: Hold on, buddy! [enters a building where Master Udon is watching from above]
SpongeBob: No, Sandy!
Master Udon: She will never reach you. She must first pass through the 'Four Floors of Fear'.
Sandy: [enters first room] SpongeBob?
The Tickler: Ha. Ha-ha-ha. You cannot pass unless you defeat me, The Tickler, and my iron-finger style. [both get ready then attack] Ha-ha. Look!
Sandy: Huh? [laughs as she is being tickled]
The Tickler: Prepare for the tickling of your life!
Sandy: Taste these! [has a plate full of jelly-filled donuts]
The Tickler: Oh no! Jelly-filled donuts? How did you know they were my weakness?
Sandy: No one can resist jelly-filled. [throws the donuts into The Tickler's mouth] Sticky around, I'll be back with the glazed.
The Tickler: I could use a wet napkin.
Sandy: [enters floor two] All right, who's next?
Lip Service: Halt! No one advances past me, Lip Service, and my power-flexi dynamo-lip thruster style. [attacks Sandy]
Lip Service: Dance, squirrel, dance. [her lips send Sandy backwards]
Sandy: Advanced hair-dryer style!
Lip Service: [laughs] What do you expect to do with that? [Sandy uses the hair-dryer to blow air on Lip Service’s lips, making them chapped] Oh, no! Not chapped lips! [takes out some lip balm. Applies some, but it breaks her lips]
Sandy: That's enough lip out of you. [enters third floor, but slips on her way in, because it's covered in mud. She slides into a big green Jabba The Hutt look-alike]
Filthy Phil: No one has ever made it to the lair of Filthy Phil. No one passes except me. Now, feel the steam of my horrible body odor. [strains to get body odor out. The body odor tries to get into Sandy's helmet, but can't]
Sandy: Ha-ha, Phil! Your foul stench can't permeate my fresh-air dome.
Filthy Phil: Fresh-air dome? [inhales his own body odor] Man, I really do stink. [passes out. Sandy breaks through some boards to enter floor four where Master Udon is]
Master Udon: You are one impressive squirrel. You even made a costume change.
Sandy: Release SpongeBob!
Master Udon: Never. [as Sandy is going to attack, she is trapped in a bird cage. She strains to break through, but she can't] He is forbidden to leave until...he signs this contract.
Sandy: What are you talking about?
Master Udon: Real estate.
Sandy: You mean this whole thing was a scam to get us to buy real estate?
Master Udon: Yes. If there was a real Karate Island, I'd be a millionaire.
SpongeBob: You mean I'm not King of Karate?
Master Udon: No. But you could be King of Condos. Here, let me explain. It's really quite simple. [pulls down chart] See, if you invest in a time share here on Condo Island, you can see your equity increase ten-fold. Perhaps you and your yellow friend would like to set up a timeshare plan?
SpongeBob: Don't do it, Sandy! [Sandy chants something]
Sandy: [breaks the bird cage] I won't give in to your timeshare vacation scam!
Master Udon: Then give into my fists. [rips off robe and exposes his speedo and to show a more buff Master Udon. Sandy does the same by ripping off her jumpsuit then exposing her bikini to reveal a buff Sandy. Both flex their bodies, starting with the extra muscles like Sandy’s Tail along with Master Udon’s Eyebrows next The Chests,Arms,Legs and they both do primal roars,then fight.They miss each other from Charging.Master Udon turns back to get her. Sandy jumps on top of Master Udon's head, then slaps him with her feet. Master Udon then grabs Sandy by her ankles then spins her around and throws her into the wall. Sandy retaliates by springing of the wall and landing in front of Master Udon They karate chop some more before Sandy grabs him and throws him on the ground over and over. She then throws him in the air and kicks him in the face, sending him outside of the tower and falling into the ocean]
Sandy: You're in the soup now, Udon! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy walking toward their boat]
SpongeBob: Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from... [swallows hard] buying a condo.
Sandy: Aw, shucks, SpongeBob, that's what friends are for.
SpongeBob: I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?
Sandy: You are in my book, SpongeBob. You are in my book. Now let me tell you about real estate. It's all about location... [boat drives off as another boat, carrying Squidward, arrives]
Squidward: I'm here! The King of Clarinets has arrived! [Master Udon is waiting on top of the rocks again]
[scene cuts to black, then fades to dedication of Pat Morita (1932 - 2005)]


[opens up with Pearl sleeping until the radio wakes her up.]
Radio: Good morning, Bikini Bottom! It's a very special day today because we have got the new single from Boys Who Cry: 'It's All About You'.
Boys Who Cry: [singing] It's all about you girl, On your sixteenth birthday! Pay attention to you girl, Everyone has to do just what you say. [A spotlight shines on Pearl] You get your very own spotlight tonight, Cuz it's all about you! Yeah, it's all about Pearl! You're the birthday girl!
Pearl: [singing] Yeah! It's all about me. On my 16th birthday, I want music, clothes, and shiny things. So give it up right away, Everybody in the whole wide world. They have to pay attention to me. It's all about me, me...and guess who? Me! [wakes up from her dream] Oops!
Mr. Krabs: [Pearl crashes through the ceiling and into the kitchen on the ground floor.] Neptune's trousers!
Pearl: Morning, daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a room on the ground floor?
Pearl: Oh, daddy. I'm just excited because tomorrow's a very special day.
Mr. Krabs: [gulps] It is? [Pearl glares at him] Oh, I mean, it is! Very special! Very, very special, indeed!
Pearl: You have no idea what day tomorrow is, do you?
Mr. Krabs: None at all.
Pearl: It's my 16th birthday! [outside Mr. Krabs house is lifted over the bubble]
Mr. Krabs: I knew that! How could you think I wouldn't know that? What are you gonna be, 12?
Pearl: [angrily] I'm going to be 16! It's only the most important birthday in my entire life. If I don't have a completely awesome party, my whole high school reputation will collapse. I'll have to drop out, I won't go off to college, I'll never leave home. You'll have to support me for the rest of my life.
Mr. Krabs: [nervously chuckles] Well, we don't want that to happen.
Pearl: Then promise me you'll give me a real party this year. And don't be cheap! [Mr. Krabs nods. Later at the high school] Hi, girls.
Friend #1: Hi, Pearl.
Pearl: Are you guys coming to my totally coral birthday party tomorrow?
Friend #1: I don't know, Pearl. Is this going to be as totally coral as last year, when your dad passed out paper clips as party favors? [the girls laugh]
Judy: Remember the time we all had to share one balloon? [balloon floats up] Please.
Friend #2: Remember the pony ride? [wooden horse with a paint can as a head and a broom stick as a tail]
Friend #1: I can't wait to see how he ruins this year. [the girls laugh as Pearl runs out of school, crying. She heads towards the Krusty Krab]
Pearl: Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh. Everybody, brace for impact!
Pearl: Tell me you've got something totally coral planned for my birthday party.
Mr. Krabs: Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set. Why, I've already got the party favors, bubble wrap! [pops the bubble wrap] This year's gonna be a blast.
Pearl: Daddy, you ruined all my birthday parties, but you better not ruin this one. Now promise me you won't be cheap!
Mr. Krabs: [gulps] I promise.
Pearl: Good, because I made a list. [list rolls out of the Krusty Krab and down the road. Mr Krabs rolls it up] Now I want everything on this list at my party. [kisses her dad and runs out] Bye. I'll be at the mall with my friends.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present. [takes out his credit card] Here you go, boy.
SpongeBob: What's this, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: It's me credit card. You use it instead of money.
SpongeBob: I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?
Mr. Krabs: Exactly.
SpongeBob: Wow.
Mr. Krabs: Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work.
SpongeBob: Detective work. I'm going undercover.
[later at the Bikini Bottom Mall]
Pearl: So, that's when Marcy told me that Julie said that Angela did like Brad.
Friend #1: Oh.
SpongeBob: [peeking through a plant as he writes something down on a notepad] Angela likes Brad.
Pearl: [holding up a purple, plastic comb] Oh my gosh, this is the greatest thing I have seen in the whole world.
SpongeBob: [runs up to the cashier] I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic. [giggles]
Cashier: [looking at the credit card] Mr. Krabs, huh? Quick, how do you spell "Krabs"?
SpongeBob: Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it.
Cashier: Close enough. [swipes the credit card through the machine] There you go, kid.
SpongeBob: That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance.
Pearl: [holding up lip gloss] Wow, this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in the whole world. Glitter gloss!
SpongeBob: Oh, no, I bought the wrong present.
Judy: Pearl, you have got to see this.
Pearl: Coming, Judy.
Mary: Oh...hmmm... [mirror flips around revealing SpongeBob. He takes the glitter gloss away from the elderly fish and the mirror flips back around]
SpongeBob: Now this is obviously the greatest present ever.
Pearl: [squeals] This is the greatest thing in the whole world! [SpongeBob sighs. Back at the Krusty Krab where Squidward is nailing down a banner]
Squidward: The banner's up, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I've had that since the day she was born. I got it on sale.
Squidward: I'm sure she'll love it, Mr. Krabs.
[back at the mall]
Pearl: This sea pony is the cutest thing ever. Do you want to come home and be my pony? [pony imagines Pearl being on its back] Whee! [pony shakes its head]
Judy: Pearl, come here. This is so coral. [SpongeBob is disguised as a dog fish next to the pony]
Pearl: Oh my gosh, it's Billy Fishkins.
All: Hi, Billy!
Billy: Meep. [all sighing. SpongeBob, dressed up as a girl, sighs after they do]
SpongeBob: [girly voice] Isn't he dreamy? [SpongeBob takes Billy and hands him to the cashier]
Cashier: Price check on 4.
Billy: Meep.
[Back at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece. [reveals a meat sculpture of Pearl]
Mr. Krabs: Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.
Squidward: Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.
Squidward: Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.
Mr. Krabs: You're a real fan, huh?
Squidward: Oh, yeah, I know all their songs.
Mr. Krabs: All their songs?
[Back at the mall where Pearl and her friends are gazing at a bunch of things and SpongeBob buys them all, including a dress, sunglasses, a pair of platform shoes, and other gifts.]
Pearl: Wouldn't it be cool if my dad got me this for my birthday?
Friend #1: It sure would be. If he was cool, which he's not. [laughs]
Pearl: Yeah, he probably got me another box of staples. [SpongeBob appears on the boat.]
[back at the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: It's almost time for the party to start!
SpongeBob: I'm back, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?
SpongeBob: The delivery truck will be here momentarily.
Squidward: Here she comes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Everybody, get into position. [Pearl and friends enter]
All: Happy birthday! [everyone is standing in front of the banner that reads 'IT'S A BOY GIRL']
Judy: "It's a boy"?! [the girls laugh]
Pearl: Daddy! [Pearl’s friends walk over to the popcorn machine and try a bite. All gag &amp; cough up the popcorn]
Friend #1: Stale popcorn. [they walk over to the punch bowl and take a sip] It tastes like dishwater.
Squidward: It is dishwater. [the girls cough out the punch]
Pearl: [notices the sculpture] Is that supposed to be me? [head falls off] It's made out of Krabby Patties! Gross!
Mr. Krabs: Who wants cake?
Pearl: Well, the cake does look good. [all take a bite, but spit it right back out] It's made out of cardboard!
Mr. Krabs: And frosting.
Friend #1: Well, Pearl, sixteen lame parties in a row. Must be a new record. Let's get out of here.
Pearl: Wait, don't leave. My dad got Boys Who Cry to play. You did get Boys Who Cry, right?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, even better, sweetie. Hit it. [curtain unfolds as R &amp; B Music beings to play with Squidward standing on the stage]
Squidward: Hello, ladies. [sings] When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!
Friend #2: Hey, that is not Boys Who Cry.
Judy: Yeah!
Friend #2: Boo!
Friend #1: What a rip-off!
Judy: This stinks!
Pearl: Daddy, how could you? I... gave... you... a list! [runs out crying]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, come back! [crowd throws Pearl’s meat head at Squidward]
Pearl: You ruined everything! You couldn't stop being cheap, even for me. [cries]
Mr. Krabs: I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl.
SpongeBob: That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go! [the dump truck full of presents unloads them all]
Pearl: You bought me a boat?
Mr. Krabs: I did? I mean...I did?!
Friends: Wow.
Pearl: Oh daddy, I don't know how it could get better than this.
SpongeBob: Just watch. [signals on his walkie-talkie] Hit it, boys! [big present at the top opens up]
Endsong: Boys Who Cry "It's All About You"
It's all about you girl, On your sixteenth birthday! Pay attention to you girl, Everyone has to do just what you say. You get your very own spotlight tonight, Cuz it's all about you! Yeah, it's all about Pearl! You're the birthday girl!
Mr. Krabs: Boy, how much is all this costing me?
SpongeBob: [shows Mr. Krabs the long receipt] Here's the receipt.
Mr. Krabs: [freaks out] I ought to...
Pearl: Oh, daddy, you got me everything I wanted. [kisses her dad]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, nothing's too good for me daughter. Heh.
SpongeBob: You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Don't push your luck, boy.


Customer: One monster Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: Hmph, no one's ordered the monster Patty in ages. SpongeBob, one monster Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [gasps, shaking] Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!
Squidward: Uh, One monster Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: HUH?! Monster Krabby Patty?!
Customers: Monster Krabby Patty?!
Customer #2: [in bathroom] Monster Krabby Patty?!
[A set of real hands drops a huge meat pile on the grill]
SpongeBob: Oh, dear Neptune.
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: [puts his spatula under the meat] We can do this. At the count of three, we flip. Ready? One, two, three. [Attempts to flip; spatula breaks in half] Spat?
[SpongeBob screams and cries in front of everyone while showing his spatula that is broken/unfixed. The scene cuts to SpongeBob to a therapist.]
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go on. [SpongeBob cries once more.]
[SpongeBob is on a cliff, still crying. Patrick comes up and joins in crying. Switches to an ambulance taking Spatula away, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob quietly watch.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, we better get back to work.
SpongeBob: Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!
Mr. Krabs: Use another spatula'r.
SpongeBob: [close-up of his face, his eyes are hypno-like] WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat! [runs off to the hospital] I'm coming, Spat!
[scene cuts to the hospital where SpongeBob is by a spatula's bed]
SpongeBob: Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together.
[SpongeBob flashes back to all the good times he had with his spatula: flipping patties, laying in the sun with spatula, scratching his back with spatula, playing ping pong with his spatula, reaching under the chair for the remote with spatula, and playing pirates with spatula.]
Doctor: There’s no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula.
[SpongeBob turns around and starts to cry, then turns back around]
Doctor: Go home. Get some rest. We'll try to do everything we can.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: Oh, I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor who's searching for a role. Yes! Woohoo! I am so totally gonna get this part. [gives a sigh of relief]
SpongeBob: [gives a kiss to the spatula and walks out of the hospital] Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that! [notices a sign that says "LE SPATULA INSIDE" and a picture of a high-tech spatula is on it]
SpongeBob: [Thinks] Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this. [walks off then reappears inside the shop in front of the spatula. Thinks] Maybe I do need this. [his eyes are shaped as a spatula]
Doctor: [in SpongeBob's thought bubble] I would give serious consideration to... [bell gongs] a replacement spatula.
[SpongeBob slowly reaches for the spatula, but his hand is slapped away by one of the employees]
SpongeBob: OW!
Employee: Uh-uh! No touchy-touchy the Le Spatula! It is very, very expensive.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry.
Employee: Of course, if you purchase this fine item, you may... hold it.
SpongeBob: I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it? [takes out a bunch of money]
Employee: Umm... [takes out a calculator and punches in many numbers] ...no.
[Scene switches to SpongeBob's house, next to a shelf of piggy banks]
SpongeBob: [breaks a piggy bank with a hammer] How about now?
Employee: No.
SpongeBob: [breaks another piggy bank] Now?
Employee: No.
[Repeat SpongeBob's action and the above two lines for three more piggy banks]
SpongeBob: [lifts up Gary's shell where there is a big diamond under it] Now?
Employee: No.
SpongeBob: [sells his house] That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula?
Employee: Everything, huh? [Looks at SpongeBob clothes] Nice outfit.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street nude where everyone is looking at him in shock]
SpongeBob: Evening, sir. Hey, granny, what's shaking? [walks into the Krusty Krab, passes Squidward] Ooh, breezy today.
Squidward: [Snickers] Nice outfit, SpongeBob! [laughs hysterically]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny.
Mr. Krabs: What's all the lallygagging about?
Squidward: [still laughing] Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: This better be good. [walks into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Soon, everyone will know of your beauty.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, what's going on in [sees SpongeBob naked] ...ooh... Don't you have any shame, boy?
SpongeBob: All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs. [shows Le Spatula]
Mr. Krabs: Le Spatular! What in blazes is that?
SpongeBob: Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma. [Le Spatula glows]
Mr. Krabs: Well, what can it do?
Squidward: Can it make me famous?
SpongeBob: Anything you want and more. [pushes a button and the spatula spins]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, that sounds exciting. Let me have a go at it. [Reaches for Le Spatula]
SpongeBob: [Holds Le Spatula away from Mr. Krabs' reach] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] What? Are you going against your commanding officer?
SpongeBob: No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.
Mr. Krabs: With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact... [pushes a button and a bunch of spatulas appear]
Le Spatula: [says mechanically] Le Spatula 3000 at your service!
Mr. Krabs: Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket. [laughs and walks away with Squidward]
SpongeBob: Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy? [all the spatulas go into hiding] Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job. [scene cuts to outside the kitchen]
Wobbles: Uh, can I get one Krabby Patty, please?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [back in the kitchen] One Krabby Patty, coming up lickety split. [tries to use Le Spatula, but every time he tries to flip the patty, the spatula goes another direction] Spat, is there something wrong, pal?
Le Spatula: I would not dare touch such slop as this, how you say, Krabby Patty. I am designed for the up most interesting cuisine. No less!
SpongeBob: But, but, I thought we were friends.
Le Spatula: Friends with you?! Ha! We are not even in the same social class. [jumps out of SpongeBob's arms and extends it legs to land on the floor] Have a nice life of mediocrity, fry cook! [runs out laughing]
SpongeBob: Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something. [Le Spatula punches SpongeBob in the face]
Le Spatula: How's that for something? Au revoir, peasants! Have fun laboring in your greasy spoon. [spits and runs out]
Mr. Krabs: What happened?
SpongeBob: Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.
Mr Krabs: Well, how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULAR?!
SpongeBob: I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!
Mr. Krabs: I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.
Mr. Krabs: Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers. [starts to cry; scene cuts to the spatula's hospital bed from the start of the episode, with the pulse meter slowing, then becomes a flat line]
SpongeBob: Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late! [cries]
Doctor: SpongeBob, I hate to tell you this...
SpongeBob: I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone! [sobs]
Doctor: Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm so sorry. [cries more]
Doctor: Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary. [scene pans over to the Infirmary where Spat is in a wheelchair]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Spatula! [runs into the infirmary] Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better! [Spat turns around and ignores SpongeBob] Spatula, what's wrong? [spatula shakes its head] But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?! [begins burst into tears loudly and rolls. As he is doing this, another SpongeBob comes up into the scene]
SpongeBob: [in a monotone voice]&#160;: All that glitters is not gold. [as SpongeBob is still crying loudly, spatula wheels itself away]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, best friend!
[SpongeBob crawls crying all the way to the Krusty Krab kitchen]
SpongeBob: I'll never find another spatula like him again. [notices a spatula flipping patties by itself] Spatula? You're back! [SpongeBob jumps for spatula in slow motion, camera cuts to outer space] Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.
Squidward: One monster Krabby Patty. [the same real set of hands put a bunch of meat on the grill as before]
SpongeBob: Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three. [SpongeBob's arms come off] D'oh! [laughs]


[The scene starts out at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is looking at Plankton through a telescope.]
Plankton: [waving a truce flag] I surrender!
Mr. Krabs: Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time. [walks up to Plankton] Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work.
Plankton: There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?
Mr. Krabs: What is this? [takes the flag and looks at it for any secret material] Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me.
Plankton: Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!
Mr. Krabs: But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?
Plankton: Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it. [sighs] Let me show you something. [scene cuts to them walking into the Chum Bucket, which is full of spider webs] Look at this place!
Mr. Krabs: [runs into a spider web and screams] Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?
Plankton: What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?
Mr. Krabs: Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer.
Plankton: Well, there he is. [points to skeleton rat on the table] That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into... [pulls out a box of knickknacks] this!
Mr. Krabs: You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?
Plankton: No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?
Plankton: I'm serious, Krabs. Soon, the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum.
Mr. Krabs: All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down.
Plankton: Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career. [hums as Mr. Krabs walks away]
SpongeBob: What's going on Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.
SpongeBob: Whatever you say, cap'n. [peels eyes]
Mr. Krabs: Now that's an employee who follows orders. [loud jack hammering is heard] What in blazes is that noise? [Plankton reveals the new name of his business: "Chumporium"]
Plankton: Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items.
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game.
SpongeBob: [holding a snow globe] Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium.
Mr. Krabs: [takes the snow globe] Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere. [tries to open it]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Mr. Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, we'll see about that. [walks to a door] I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past. [throws snow globe into a room full of Plankton's past schemes, then locks the door] Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.
SpongeBob: That's some good news, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Right away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Let's party! [music plays and SpongeBob is seen DJ-ing] Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Squidward: This is idiotic.
Mr. Krabs: Dance or you're fired.
Squidward: You got it, Mr. Krabs. [dances]
Mr. Krabs: [opens front door] How do you like them apples, you little... [record scratching]
Plankton: [carrying a toy seal behind him] Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute. [sneaks over to the Chumporium] What the...? [sees a bunch of novelty items inside through the window] Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps? [gasps] Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war. [scene cuts to Mr Krabs walking into the Chumporium. Plankton is dusting off his knickknacks]
Plankton: [Humming] Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me.
Plankton: Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed. [laughs then sighs] Those were the days, huh Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Grr...
Plankton: But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.
Mr. Krabs: Bubkes.
Plankton: Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.
Mr. Krabs: Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula. [takes out the formula] You know you want it.
Plankton: Thanks, but no.
Mr. Krabs: A-ha, I knew it. [chuckles] It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?
Plankton: Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine.
Mr. Krabs: Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front... [throws one of the shelves down. Plankton gasps] ...a sham, a snow job... [throwing snow globes onto the ground and breaking them] ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive! [shatters a row of lava lamps with a big stick] SEE?! Who's the one with the problem?!
Plankton: Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.
Mr. Krabs: Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow. [chuckles]
Plankton: [very angry, screaming] Get out!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move. [drops the formula] Oops.
Plankton: What's this? [groans] Hey, Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: I knew you'd come back.
Plankton: You forgot something. [throws the formula back at Mr. Krabs] Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton! [cries loudly, he runs across the road and falls down crying some more. Scene cuts to night. Phone rings in the Chumporium as Plankton is taking a shower]
Plankton: Coming, coming. [answers] Yo.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, Plankton?
Plankton: Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, hey.
Plankton: Hey.
Mr. Krabs: Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?
Plankton: Yes. I'm still here.
Mr. Krabs: Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?
Plankton: Sure. [scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab. Mr Krabs and Plankton are sitting at a table with sodas]
Mr. Krabs: Glad you could make it, buddy.
Plankton: So, what's this about, Krabs? [sips his soda]
Mr. Krabs: I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.
Plankton: Yes. Yes, I would like that very much. [scene cuts to Mr Krabs and Plankton walking along the pier then playing pool] I guess I won. [both laugh before Plankton gets hit by a ball. Scene cuts to both in a hot air balloon, on a slide, eating cotton candy, then at a trust booth]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.
Plankton: Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you. [chuckles. Mr. Krabs falls back and Plankton strains to keep him up. Scene cuts to both sitting on the edge of the pier]
Mr. Krabs: That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%.
Plankton: Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me.
Mr. Krabs: And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something.
Plankton: Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts.
Mr. Krabs: No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.
Plankton: I can't believe you would even think...
Mr. Krabs: Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.
Plankton: You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.
Mr. Krabs: Come on, take it.
Plankton: You sure? [Mr. Krabs nods] Life is good, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Sure is, buddy. Sure is. [screen fades to black. Plankton appears]
Plankton: Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo! [laughs. Runs into his Chumporium] I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician. [laughs. Opens up the formula to read "GOTCHA! Love, Krabs". Lights turn on]
Mr. Krabs: I'd never give you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade. [laughs and walks out. Plankton screams with frustrated anger.]


[chirping]
Squidward: What a sun-tastic day! [slips on Gary's snail trail] Snail trail. [Gary looks through a window as Squidward mops up the trail] That SpongeBob needs to keep his pet out of my yard. I am sick of cleaning up after him.
Gary: Meow. [Squidward discovers Gary leaving trail all over his pet rock collection]
Squidward: Not my pet rock collection. [growls, and starts jumping up and down] That's it! This isn't the first time you've soiled my yard with your revolting excretions. But mark this down in your little notebook: it will be the last time! [Later, Squidward puts up a force field of wood all around his house] This cheap, splintering wood will keep even Gary out. Now, I feel safe. [Gary's trail drops all over him] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: [calmly] Hey, SpongeBob... [screaming] Keep your shelled vermin off of my property! The next time, my annoyingly yellow neighbor, your wet pet oozes on my lawn, you leave me no choice but to call Snail Control. That little monster... [Gary bites Squidward's butt. Squidward stutters] He bit me!
SpongeBob: [pulling Gary away] Gary! No, dirty boy. This isn't like you.
Squidward: Oh, but it's just like you, SpongeBob, to raise such a misbehaved mollusk.
SpongeBob: Gary's not misbehaved!
Gary: [growling]
SpongeBob: But there does appear to be something wrong with him.
Squidward: I'll say. I hope he had his shots.
SpongeBob: Oh, of course.
Squidward: All of his shots?
SpongeBob: Affirmatory.
Squidward: For rabies?
SpongeBob: Yup.
Squidward: Snail pox and soft shell dance?
SpongeBob: Yupie.
Squidward: Bronchitis, lumpy-bump trump, teen angst?
SpongeBob: Yup, yup, yup.
Patrick: [suddenly appearing] Well, let's not forget the worst of them all: Mad Snail Disease.
SpongeBob: Uhh...
Patrick: You mean your pet hasn't been vaccinated for mad snail disease? [to Squidward] Looks like the rash has already started.
Squidward: Rash?
Patrick: Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?
Squidward: [gulps] Well, now that you mention it, my throat is a little dry.
Patrick: This disease will ravage your body with bloodshot eyes, loss of balance... [pushes Squidward]
Squidward: Whoa!
[Gary growls.]
Patrick: Messy pants, [tickles Squidward] ticklish rib cage, [Squidward giggles before Patrick points to his foot] severely untrimmed toenails, and finally, the bite from that infected snail [Squidward freaks out] will turn you into... A zombie.
[Squidward screams, then runs off crying loudly.]
Patrick: [To SpongeBob] You need to get that snail of yours to a doctor before he bites someone important. [both gasp once they see that Gary is missing] There's a mad snail on the loose! [runs off screaming]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary?! Gary?! Gary?!
Patrick: [runs up to a couple] The mad snail is coming! If he bites you, you'll turn into a zombie.
Fish: Jeepers, what's with all the lunatics? [Gary crawls up]
Fish's Wife: Oh look, honey, isn't he the cutest? [Gary is panting]
Fish: Come here, little buddy. [pets Gary] He's just adorable. [Gary bites him] Mad snail disease is real! I'm a zombie. I've been bitten by a mad snail. I've got mad snail disease!
Fish #2: Then I've got it! A snail just bit me, too! [all screaming]
Frank: [screams; all look at their hands and scream.]
Johnny: We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a news blast. Terror in a shell. This just in... fear and disease are spreading like wildfire as a killer snail has been biting the denizens of Bikini Bottom infecting them with... mad snail disease. [(two scream sound effects are played at once. One of them is from the  "Hooky" episode, the other one was used on the show Rocko's Modern Life.] Ask any old fish on the street and they'll tell you that germs enter through the bite radius, traveling upstream until the entire host body is full of... mad snail disease. [the same sound effect from above can be heard] We now take you to Action News Reporter Perch Perkins live on the scene.
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here with the first victim of this epidemic. Tell me Mr Tentacles, when did you first begin to suspect that you were a zombie?
Squidward: Well, after I was bitten by a mad snail, I began to get a rash; followed by loss of balance, ticklish rib cage, and a few other symptoms.
Frank: [wearing red shirt] Hey, I was bitten by a snail. I kinda feel off balance. [falls over] Whoa.
Perch Perkins: Hey, I have a ticklish rib cage, too. And I haven't even been bitten.
Frank: [wearing red shirt] Oh no, it's spreading through the air! [all scream]
Perch Perkins: Well, you heard it here first. We're all doomed to a horrible demise. Thanks to a diseased snail. [screams and runs around in circles; TV static then back on; still screaming]
SpongeBob: [shocked due to the news; people screaming] Gary? [horn honking] I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction.
Squidward: [moaning] I'm a zombie... here to dine on your squishy yellow flesh! [moaning like a zombie. Some of the people moan and are zombies. SpongeBob screaming and takes a bus; SpongeBob still screaming and running to the Krusty Krab] It's locked! [all moaning] Somebody let me in.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come in, boy. And bring your friends in, too. They look hungry. [uses key to open]
Frank: Stop! You can't let anyone in!
Mr. Krabs: But they just want to dine on some Krabby Patties.
Frank: They're zombies. They only want to dine on our flesh.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, alright, but it's coming out of your paycheck.
Frank: I don't work here.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?
SpongeBob: Could a voracious flesh-eater do this? [he uses his body to slide through the door]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, it's you.
SpongeBob: That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, that's SpongeBob all right.
Patrick: Or is it?
SpongeBob: Huh?
Patrick: I don't believe that's the real SpongeBob. He looks pretty zombified. Just look at how yellow he is.
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet? [shows picture]
Patrick: Perhaps not, but I got my eye on you!
Old Man Jenkins: If you could pull out your eye and put it on him, wouldn't that make... You a zombie too?
Patrick: You're right. [alarmed] I'm a zombie!
Old Man Jenkins: Who's to say we're not all zombies?! [all scream]
Gary: Meow. [slithers out of the kitchen]
All: The snail!
SpongeBob: Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy.
Harold: No, don't get near it. Oh, the pity of it all!
Evelyn: [to Harold] I can't watch. [faints into Harold's arms]
SpongeBob: All those people think you're a monster. But I know you're just a snail. [screaming after Gary bites him] Gary... [sniffling] How could you?
All: [gasp]
Harold: SpongeBob's been infected by his own pet snail. Oh, the irony! Quick, we must quarantine that infected snail before he bites every last Bikini Bottomite. Let's get the snail!
All: Yeah!
SpongeBob: No! Don't hurt him!
Harold: Hand over the snail!
Mr. Krabs: It's... for his own good, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No! I won't let you touch Gary!
Harold: Stop the madness, man! The Mad Snail Disease ends now! Seize the snail!
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Halt! Did someone say 'Mad Snail Disease'? Is that what all this fuss is about?
Patrick: Yeah. What do you know about it?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Funny you should ask. Allow me to introduce myself. Doctor Gill Gilliam. S.D.E. and S.E.
SpongeBob: S.D.E. and S.E.?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Snail disease expert and snail expert. I'm sorry to break this to you all, but that 'mad snail disease' you're talking about, it doesn't exist.
All: Huh?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: That's right. No such thing. It's an old urban legend. A myth.
Patrick: Well, does that mean we're not zombies?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Of course not. No one is. It's just mass hysteria.
Nathiel: But what about my severely untrimmed...
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Those are only moderately untrimmed. All the supposed symptoms are just common ailments.
SpongeBob: [holding Gary back] Easy, boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Hmmm... mm-hmm. Ahh! The problem's right here. He's got a little splinter in his foot. [The doctor pulls out the splinter and Gary is now back to normal, a zoom out shows that the splinter was one of Squidward's logs, just as an example] I'm sure this was the cause of his distemper making for serious grouchy snailitis.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good ol' Gary's back. [Sandals, Bill, Nathaniel, Charlie, and VB get mad when Squidward comes in and keeps acting like a zombie] Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember?
Squidward: Oh, yes I am. [Nathaniel walks up to order] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
Mr. Krabs: All's well that ends well.
[Gary bites Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Ow! [tries to kill the pain, then looks at Gary]


Mr. Krabs: Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.
SpongeBob: Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?
Mr. Krabs: Fine?! [grabs SpongeBob's mouth and ties it up] Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine. [cries]
SpongeBob: Time off?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this... SpongeBob, take a vacation.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. [runs out]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that went better than expected.
SpongeBob: [running down the street] I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation. [enters his house] Hey, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary. [walks into his bed and closes his eyes for no more than two seconds before his alarm goes off. Scene cuts to him lifting his weights, eating cereal, flossing, showering, then putting on some spray to make him shine. He grabs his hat then walks into the Krusty Krab] Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.
Squidward: I thought you were on vacation.
Mr. Krabs: [stops SpongeBob] He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.
SpongeBob: What's a vacation?
Mr. Krabs: Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.
SpongeBob: [gasps] No work?! But what'll I do all day?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.
SpongeBob: But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
Squidward: Nor will I.
Mr. Krabs: That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.
Patrick: [walks in] Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.
Mr. Krabs: Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.
SpongeBob: Replacement?
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: That's enough banter on my dime.
Patrick: Ok, boss.
Mr. Krabs: Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job. [takes SpongeBob's hat and spatula and gives it to Patrick]
Patrick: Wow. [notices his reflection in the spatula] Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher. [scratches his belly and his back] Wow. It scratches backs, too!
Mr. Krabs: Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.
SpongeBob: I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique. [Mr. Krabs shuts the doors in SpongeBob's face. Scene cuts to inside SpongeBob's house]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work. [stomach growls then shrinks. SpongeBob gasps] My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside! [scene cuts to Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.
SpongeBob: I'm not here to see you, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?
SpongeBob: I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.
SpongeBob: You have my word, sir. No working. [enters kitchen] Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch... [screams as he sees Patrick putting patties, attached to his body, on the grill] Patrick, you can't do that!
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit. [turns the knob to the right from 297 to 298. Takes Patrick's spatula] Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [storms into the kitchen] SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?
SpongeBob: Wait, it's not what you think.
Mr. Krabs: [wheels SpongeBob on a dolly] Out you go, boy.
SpongeBob: But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, boy... [launches SpongeBob off] off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over. [scene cuts to SpongeBob entering his house]
SpongeBob: Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset. [sits down in front of a toy Krusty Krab with Krusty Krew figures. Opens it up]
Squidward: [SpongeBob imitating him] SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.
Mr. Krabs: [SpongeBob imitating him] SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over. [takes SpongeBob's Krusty hat off. SpongeBob walks home, sad]
SpongeBob: [walking inside his pineapple] Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up. [plays with a smaller Krusty Krab playset]
Squidward: [SpongeBob imitating him] I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house. [scene cuts to Krusty Krab where Squidward is washing windows until he sees SpongeBob]
Squidward: Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.
Mr. Krabs: I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up. [SpongeBob steps backwards] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards until he is in front of his house] That'll do.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally. [looks at his net] Hey, that reminds me of... [his net turns into a spatula. Pretends to grill but stops] Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax. [floats onto the ground] That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds. [watches a cloud go by] That one's a jellyfish! [another cloud goes by] That's a pirate ship. [another cloud goes by] And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup? [scene cuts to Krusty Krab where a delivery truck backs up. SpongeBob, in a disguise, walks up to the kitchen door] Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here. [another delivery truck backs up. A delivery fish gets out with the same buns on a plate]
Delivery Fish: Huh? What's the big idea, here? [SpongeBob laughs nervously then gets booted out. Scene cuts to the phone ringing inside the Krusty Krab. Patrick answers]
Patrick: Hello? Hello? Hello? [SpongeBob slips through phone cord and through Patrick's head but gets shot out of the Krusty Krab, through the doors. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab restroom where Patrick is cleaning out his ear] Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear. [notices water splashing out from the toilet behind him] Hey, I just cleaned that one.
SpongeBob: Patrick, shhh.
Patrick: It talks! [screams and runs out]
SpongeBob: Somebody help, I'm stuck! [Mr. Krabs walks up] Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here. [Mr. Krabs grabs a cord above the toilet] Um, Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs flushes the toilet] Noooo!! [gets flushed down the toilet. Scene cuts to SpongeBob jumping out of a customers shirt and into the grease fryer in the kitchen] Uh oh.
Mr. Krabs: Now what? [picks up the fryer and sees SpongeBob small and deep fried] Tsk, tsk, tsk. [SpongeBob then crumbles into crumbs and puts him in his boat out back] I've had enough for one day, son. [drives off]
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Not a problem at all, me boy.
SpongeBob: Just take the next right. [Mr. Krabs drives past his house] Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: My house is back that way, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs: Far out, little man. Far out. [drives into a forest and stops]
SpongeBob: Where'd you say you were taking me?
Mr. Krabs: Look, boy, [takes out a spatula] I brought your spatuler. [SpongeBob glares at the spatula and acts like a dog] C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it! [throws the spatula into the forest. SpongeBob chases after it while Mr. Krabs turns around and drives off] Enjoy your vacation, boy!
SpongeBob: It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a... [gasps] ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them! [scene cuts to Patrick running down the street to his rock]
Patrick: Working at the Krusty Krab. Making Krabby Patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember. [opens his rock and jumps in] Huh?
SpongeBob: [sitting in the corner of Patrick's rock] Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire me like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
Patrick: SpongeBob? Is that you?
SpongeBob: [turns around with an evil look on his face] I've been waiting for you, Patrick! [walks towards Patrick, growling]
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh! [SpongeBob laughs maniacally and closes in around Patrick. Scene cuts to Krusty Krab]
Squidward: What’ll be?
Customer: One Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: One shell on a shingle. [Patrick gives Squidward the order then many orders come out, it blocks the window just for Mr. Krabs to notice]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it. [Patrick turns around, and it turns out to be SpongeBob in a Patrick costume] SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?
SpongeBob: Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television. [Patrick is sitting at home watching a broken TV]
Mr. Krabs: Why'd you do it, laddy?
SpongeBob: [starts to cry] Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!
Mr. Krabs: You don't have to. [takes out a calendar] Your accumulated vacation time is used up. [tears up calendar] The union can't fine me, anymore.
SpongeBob: You must've saved a fortune.
Mr. Krabs: Bumping barnacles, yes. [laughs and holds up a dime] There she is.
SpongeBob: Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
Mr. Krabs: Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.
SpongeBob: [jumps out of the Patrick costume] Yippee! I happily acquiesce.


[A bus is driving down the road with three band members sitting inside.]
Band Member #1: Man, this is gonna be our most rocking tour, ever.
Band Member #2: [singing] Yeah.
Ned: Hey, dudes, check out the debut of my new look. [band members laugh]
Band Member #1: Whoa, what's that on your head?
Band Member #3: Yeah, is that a wig or a pile of toilet paper?
Ned: C'mon, guys, give it a chance.
Band Member #2: Let me try it on. [grabs the wig]
Ned: Hey, you've revealed my shiny dome!
Band Member #2: Hot potato. Catch! [band members throw it back and forth between each other]
Ned: Give it back, man!
Band Member #2: If you want it, you gotta catch it, dude. [throws it to band member, but it goes through the window]
Band Member #1: Oops.
Ned: Ah! Oh, man, my beautiful wig! [the wig flies through the air, in and out of the dump then through the wig cemetery]
SpongeBob: [opens his front door] I'm ready! I'm rea... [the wig crashes into him and he falls over. He sits up and it's on top of his head] Ah, what is this? Curly tresses, poofy texture, [scratches inside wig] itchy scalp... [gasps] it's a wig! [walks over to Patrick's rock] Hi, Patrick. How do you like my new wig?
Patrick: [screams, then jumps on SpongeBob, pinning him to the ground] I'll save you. [jumps on SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Pa... trick... what are... you doing?
Patrick: I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your... [slams SpongeBob's head on to a rock] ...head!
SpongeBob: Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!
Patrick: [stops] Oh, sorry.
SpongeBob: It's okay. [Patrick takes a bite out of the wig] Why did you do that?
Patrick: [swallows and burps] Well, I thought it was a new type of cotton candy you wear on your head.
SpongeBob: Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea.
Patrick: Then what is it?
SpongeBob: It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig.
Patrick: A wig? [laughs uncontrollably] Oh, boy. Don't you think that's a little silly? [in his pocket, an alarm starts to ring so he takes it out] Oh, man, it's time for my weekly condiment soak. [climbs into a tub and pours a giant jar of mustard on himself. Looks at SpongeBob] Do you mind? [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street with his wig on]
Fish #1: Nice wig. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Thanks. I am very fashionable today.
Tina: Hey, SquareFashion, nice couture.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you.
Pilar: So then... [notices SpongeBob] Huh...?
Peterson: Nice do, SpongeBob. [tries to contain his laughter]
Pilar: Yeah, where can I get one? [Peterson and Pilar laugh]
Sally: Whoa. That wig really suits you. [laughing]
SpongeBob: [walks up to Squidward, who is sleeping on the job] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [screams] Who? What? Where? What? How?
SpongeBob: Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?
Squidward: Nope.
SpongeBob: I'm wearing a wig.
Squidward: Oh yeah, how could I have missed it?
SpongeBob: Can you believe I found it lying around in the street?
Squidward: Umm...maybe.
SpongeBob: If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you.
Squidward: I can't wait.
SpongeBob: Wig away! [floats into the kitchen. While grilling some patties, he scratches his wig with the spatula and many hairs float down onto the patties. He puts one of the hairy patties on the bun] Order up, Squidward. [Squidward notices the hair on the Krabby Patty]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs walks up to Squidward] I've served a lot of junk here, but a hair patty?
Mr. Krabs: [walks into the kitchen] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs? [a lot of hairs come off the wig and onto Mr. Krabs eyes]
Mr. Krabs: What in Davy Jones' locker is on your head, son?
SpongeBob: Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, take it off. The hair's getting into the patties.
SpongeBob: Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy.
Mr. Krabs: Happy?
SpongeBob: Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face.
Mr. Krabs: I can imagine.
SpongeBob: Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet. [takes one out] And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster.
SpongeBob: [puts the hairnet over his wig then walks out with an order]
Sandy: There you are, SpongeBob. Are you ready for karate prac...tice? [notices SpongeBob's wig]
SpongeBob: I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?
Sandy: Wig's... uh great...SpongeBob. [laughs uncontrollably]
SpongeBob: Glad you like it. [chuckles] I'll see you later, Sandy. [walks up to a table and sets the tray on it] Two krabby patties and a side order of looking good.
Frank: Nice wig.
Abigail: Like to keep in style, huh?
SpongeBob: You know it.
Francis: Off to meet the queen, Sir Nerdlaroy?
SpongeBob: Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance. [gets off balance with the wig and stumbles into the corner. Everyone crowds around him and laughs] Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs.
Jimmy: How 'bout a little off the top?
Tom: Yeah, your wig is big enough to go around.
SpongeBob: This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous. [walks backwards towards the kitchen] Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me.
Squidward: Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame. [scene cuts to Bigshot Records]
Record Producer: Well, well, well, Ned and the Needlefish. You're fired.
Band: Fired?!
Band Member #2: But why?
Record Producer: Ask Baldy McBalderson over here.
Band: Ned!
Band Member #2: Good going, dude.
Ned: I can't help not having hair!
Band Member #3: When we formed this band, it was for one reason and one reason only: to make a lot of money. And you not having hair is getting in the way of that!
Record Producer: We are selling records, not denture cream! [talking to Ned] Either you come back with hair, or don't come back at all! [scene cuts to Krusty Krab at closing time]
Mr. Krabs: [flips OPEN sign to CLOSED] Time to go home, boys.
SpongeBob: [mopping with his wig] Almost finished. [puts the wet wig on his head. Shakes it dry and it goes back to its original shape] See, Squidward, it's functional, too.
Squidward: It's about as functional as your brain.
SpongeBob: [giggles] Thank you, Squidward.
Squidward: That wasn't a compliment! The entire town is laughing at you!
SpongeBob: I don't understand.
Squidward: [holds a mirror up to SpongeBob] Just look at yourself.
SpongeBob: Hello, handsome. [licks finger and puts it on the mirror] Sss.
Squidward: SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before!
SpongeBob: Hmmm, I've never been tall before.
Squidward: That wig is infested with parasites! [spiders crawl out of the wig and SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: That tickles!
Squidward: Can't you see how ridiculous you look?
SpongeBob: I think that it looks cool.
Mr. Krabs: Hahahaha! You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer! [laughs]
SpongeBob: For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is.
Mr. Krabs: Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: No buts!
SpongeBob: So I can't have a wig or a butt?
Mr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig, get your butt outta here! [scene cuts to Sandy walking up to SpongeBob's house]
Sandy: I never got a chance to talk to SpongeBob yesterday. I was laughing too hard. [knocks on door] SpongeBob? Huh?
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy. What do you think?
Sandy: We need to talk. [scene cuts to The Reef]
SpongeBob: Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody. [everyone is laughing]
Sandy: Well, it does attract a lot of attention.
SpongeBob: I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me.
Sandy: Neither can I, SpongeBob. [they walk in to the theater. Scooter closes the door and laughs. Scene cuts to inside theater, where the movie is playing]
Martha: It's true, John, this isn't my real hair! I stole it! [takes her wig off. SpongeBob walks into the row with his wig blocking the screen]
SpongeBob: Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. [Peterson sticks out his leg [along with an angry Nazz] and SpongeBob trips over it. SpongeBob gets his wig stuck in some cheese on the floor. Get sunstuck but a soda is still in the wig] Hey, the wig broke my fall! [some popcorn falls from the top of his wig] Mmm, popcorn. [eats some then takes the soda in his wig and takes a sip of it] Ah, you always come through for me.
Dale: [With a voice similar to Mr. Krabs's] Hey buddy, do you mind?
SpongeBob: Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie! [Dale behind SpongeBob starts to growl, the camera pans to the right to get a picture of Sandy.]
Sandy: Well, they can't. Look, your stupid wig is blocking the whole screen.
All: [everyone are talking at once. We can hear some of them] Fish #1: Take it off, Jerk!; Fish #2: Hey!; Fish #3: Hey! Down in front!; Fish #4: Take the wig off!
SpongeBob: People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot.
Scooter: That's a great idea! Let's start a riot. [everyone gets a pitchfork or torch ready]
SpongeBob: [screams as he and Sandy run out as the riot follows.]
Frank: [talking to Peterson] I told you that movie was terrible.
[Cut to a grassland, SpongeBob and Sandy are seen walking and talking]
Sandy: Now do you see what I'm saying, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too.
Sandy: It's time to be strong.
SpongeBob: I know. [walks over to the edge of the cliff and takes his wig off] I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!
Sandy: Hurry up, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me. [wig flies off, SpongeBob starts crying] I'll never accessorize again.
Sandy: You did the right thing, SpongeBob. [scene cuts to Ned walking down the street]
Ned: Where am I gonna get some hair? My career is ruined. Ruined! [sobbing] Can it be? It is! My wig. Yes! Victory is mine.
SpongeBob: Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere.
Debbie: Oh, he's got your hair.
Shubie: Thank you.
Patrick: [without a wig on his head] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig.
Patrick: Look at my new wig. [raises his arm and the wig is attached to his armpit]
SpongeBob: Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool.
Fish #1: Yeah, they were. But look... [points to a billboard with Ned and the Needlefish wearing the same wigs]
SpongeBob: Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?
Fish #1: Yes, you were. But not anymore. See ya! [walks off]
SpongeBob: I wish I had a wig. [Patrick walks up to him]
Patrick: Don't be sad, SpongeBob. You can borrow one of mine. [rips his wig off his armpit and pits it on SpongeBob's head] Just wash it before you return it.

 
[The Bikini Bottom Island is shown.]
French Narrator: Today, [The scene goes underwater.] we study the gentle of rhythm of the sea.
[The scene shows the exterior of Patrick's rock, Squidward's house, and SpongeBob's pineapple. Loud music is heard coming from SpongeBob's pineapple.]
Narrator: [Angrily] Gentle rhythm! [The scene shows the front of SpongeBob's pineapple.] Oh, never mind.
[The living room is shown. Gary is shown.]
Gary: Meow.
[He enters his shell and closes a door to the shell. SpongeBob's feet start sliding backwards.]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh! [All of him is shown and he is sliding in front of a stereo system and wearing a blue headband.] Uh-huh!
[SpongeBob stops next to Patrick, who is wearing a violet headband. The two slap their armpits. SpongeBob slaps his left arm pit and Patrick slaps his right. They get close together and start making fart noises with their armpits. They stop that and separate. They then bob up and down. SpongeBob runs into another part of the room]
SpongeBob: Ocean wave!! [He makes a wave with his arms going right to left and then left to right.] Tropical breeze.
[He starts swaying from side to side. Patrick is shown. He twirls around with his right hand on the floor, going clockwise. He the starts spinning on his butt with his arms holding his legs.]
Patrick: Whirlpool!
[Patrick starts spinning so fast that he moves out of the scene. SpongeBob is shown doing a head stand.]
SpongeBob: Reverse Whirlpool!
[SpongeBob takes his arms and twirls himself. He starts to spin really quickly. Patrick then hits SpongeBob while they are both doing the whirlpools and they go flying. Patrick goes left and SpongeBob goes right. They start bouncing off the walls. Squidward is shown in his house playing his clarinet. He plays a few notes badly, but stops because he is annoyed with how loudly SpongeBob's music is. The exterior of both SpongeBob and Squidward's houses is shown. Squidward opens the window.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, turn that noise off! [Squidward's window is shown. He takes out his clarinet.] This'll get his attention.
[Squidward starts to blow into the clarinet. SpongeBob's stairwell is shown. SpongeBob knocks down the door with his spinning legs. Patrick is still bouncing in the living room. SpongeBob flies out of the room and hits Squidward in the face, knocking him back and lodging his clarinet in his mouth. SpongeBob bounces a little more and lands on Squidward's floor.]
SpongeBob: Oh! [He face is shown to be inside his body. It pops out.] Oh.
[Squidward is shown.]
Squidward: Sponge...
[A note from the clarinet plays. Squidward starts choking. The clarinet gets even more lodged in his throat SpongeBob gasps.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! You've swallowed your clarinet again. I'll get it!
[SpongeBob starts walking towards Squidward.]
Squidward: No! [Squidward gets up and starts walking backwards.] No! [A note plays] Don't... [A note plays] touch... [A note plays and he hits a wall.] me!
[A note plays and Squidward tries to hold SpongeBob's arms to keep him from touching him.]
SpongeBob: I'll get a better look. [He opens Squidward mouth wide and looks inside. Squidward's mouth is shown.] Mmmmm. It's too dark. This calls for extreme measures. [He takes Squidward and puts Squidward's mouth over SpongeBob. Squidward starts flailing his arm tentacles. Noises starts happening. The exterior of the three houses. Sally and Monroe Timmy are outside. Sally is holding Monroe Timmy's arm and he is shocked. Sally puts her arm fins around Monroe Timmy's ears and they walk away. Squidward and SpongeBob are shown again. SpongeBob is struggling to get the clarinet out. He gets it out.] Got it. Hey, the pointy bit at the end is missing!
[Squidward takes his clarinet.]
Squidward: It's called a reeEEEEeeed! [When he says the last part, a note plays.]
SpongeBob: What's a [SpongeBob makes his face looks like Squidward's] "reeEEEEeeed!"?
[SpongeBob's face goes back to normal.]
Squidward: Great! [A high note plays.] My reed... [A note plays.] is still... [A note plays.] stuck in my... [A note plays.] throat! [A note plays.] And it's all your fault! [A note plays.]
SpongeBob: [As notes are playing from Squidward's mouth] There's only one thing to do. We gotta see Sandy.
[The scene changes to show an x-ray of Squidward's neck with the reed in it.]
Sandy: [Off-screen] Hmm. [Panning to show her in her treedome looking at the x-ray.] Just as I thought. [SpongeBob is shown next to Sandy, who is next to Squidward, who is wearing a helmet behind an x-ray machine.] You have that pointy bit from the end of your clarinet stuck in your throat. That was [She lifts the x-ray machine from Squidward, who is angry.] clumsy of you.
Squidward: I didn't! It was SpongeBob who...
[A note plays.]
Sandy: Well, there's nothing to do for it, but surgery.
[Sandy pulls Squidward's left arm tentacle and runs off-screen.]
SpongeBob: Oooooooh!
[SpongeBob walks after them. The scene changes to show the three outside. They walk up a ramp that leads to a submarine that is on a platform with a laser above it. The platform is connected to a another area that has a satellite dish on it.]
Sandy: Now is my chance to try out my new invention - the solution to your problem.
Squidward: A submarine?
[A note plays.]
Sandy: That's right, Squidward. Let me show ya. [She walks off-screen. The scene changes to show. A laboratory with a large computer that has Squidward's general shape on it. The shape is on its side. His brain, lungs, heart, and stomach shown.] This whole lab is called the Chamber of Shrinkage. [The image of Squidward's general shape moves to the left, rotates, and Squidward is shown. A submarine is shown.] I'll shrink the sub and myself to microscopic size... [The scene zooms into the images of the submarine and then a shrink ray appears. a beam of light appears and the image of the submarine shrinks. It start moving towards the Squidward image.] ...then navigate through [The submarine enters the Squidward image and it becomes how it was in the original. It is shown on the brain image.] your brain, [The submarine goes down Squidward's cerebral cortex and to the reed.] down into your throat, [The ship does the same thing it did, but in reverse and with the reed.] then extract the reed [Sandy is shown holding her hands together.] from inside. Simple!
Squidward: Why don't you just shrink the reed?
[Sandy laughs.]
Sandy: Oh, Squidward, always wanting to do it the hard way. [The scene changes to show Squidward in a white patients gown sitting on a chair. Sandy is in front of him and SpongeBob is behind her.] We're all set, Squidward! Are you ready for the sedative?
Squidward: Are you sure this is safe?
Sandy: Completely! As long as someone competent is behind the wheel. Hey, what's that?!? [Squidward looks then Sandy knocks him out with a karate chop.] Hi-yah! Sweet dreams, partner. Oops! I forgot to pack food for the trip. I've got to get some supplies from my treedome, and I need you to guard the submarine while I'm gone. [SpongeBob smiles] Do you think you can handle it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Can do, Sandy! [The scene changes to show SpongeBob walking back and forth in front of the submarine.] Hut-hut-hut, hut-hut-hut! Hut-hut-hut, huttidy-hut-hut!
[Patrick walks up to SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hello citizen!
Patrick: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Guarding Sandy's submarine.
Patrick: Wow, I've never been in a submarine. Let's look inside!
SpongeBob: Can't. I'm guarding it.
Patrick: Oh, man! Could you guard it from the inside?
[SpongeBob stops.]
SpongeBob: You're riiiight! [He bows to Patrick.] Patrick, you're a genius!
[SpongeBob takes a remote with a red Button with a label that reads, "open". He presses the button. The door to the submarine opens.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooohhh!
[They both salute]
SpongeBob: SpongeBob and Patrick reporting for "guard duty"! [They both laugh and jump inside. Patrick stars pressing buttons and SpongeBob pretends to be piloting the submarine.]
Patrick: Hmm... [He finds a yellow button with a label that reads "Shrink".] "Shrink." I do have a lot of issues.
[Patrick presses the button and a warning light starts.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Prettyyyy.
[The submarine shrinks a little, squishing SpongeBob and Patrick against the windshield. Sandy enters the room.]
Sandy: I'm back, SpongeBob! [She drops box of nuts.] Uh-oh...
[SpongeBob shrinks and Patrick laughs while grabbing SpongeBob.]
Patrick: You're so tiny! [He shrinks even smaller than SpongeBob.] Ahhh!! A giant SpongeBob!!
[The two shrink until they appear to look like dots. The submarine shrinks completely. A robot hand grabs the submarine. Sandy leans in.]
Sandy: PATRICK! SPONGEBOB!
[Patrick screams]
Patrick: Sandy's grown to gigantic size!
SpongeBob: I don't think Sandy grew, Patrick. I think we shrunk!
Patrick: [Stupidly]That's silly. Don't you think it's more likely that the entire world grew?
[The robot hand takes the submarine and sticks it in Squidward's nose.]
Sandy: Hi, Squidward. [Squidward wakes up.] Well, the submarine is safely inside you.
Squidward: Wonderful. [Frantic] Wait! If you're out here, then who's in here?!
[Squidward holds head.]
Sandy: Well, why don't you take a look for yourself?
[Sandy pulls down a monitor showing the submarine inside of Squidward. The scene zooms in to show SpongeBob and Patrick inside. Squidward screams.]
Squidward: SpongeBob and Patrick are piloting a miniature submarine inside my head?!?! SpongeBob and Patrick... SpongeBob and...
[Squidward chuckles nervously. Sandy joins in. Squidward then screams while freaking out. He then breathes heavily and then screams.]
Sandy: You better calm down, Squidward. With them little critters inside you, I wouldn't be moving around too much. You could knock them into something important.
[Squidward swallows nervously and stops. The submarine is shown inside Squidward's nose.
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Where are we, Patrick??
Patrick: [off-screen] I don't know, but it's a real dump.
Sandy: [over speaker] SpongeBob, Patrick! Can you hear me?
SpongeBob: It's Sandy!
Patrick: She's in there?!?! [He pulls out an ax.] I'LL SAVE YOU, SANDY!!!
[Patrick chops away at the control panel]
Sandy: Stop it, you itty-bitty idiot!
[The engine sputters and dies.]
SpongeBob: Sandy, where are you? Where are we!?
Sandy: You're trespassing, SpongeBob -- in my lab, in my submarine -- and you're trespassing [The scene shows her at the speaker and Squidward in the background.] inside of Squidward!
[The scene returns to SpongeBob and Patrick who look around the area and see that Sandy's right.]
Patrick: I thought this place was in bad shape?
Squidward: [SpongeBob and Patrick jolt as Squidward speaks over the speaker] I heard that!
Sandy: [over speaker] Let's get you out of there, SpongeBob. All you need to do is locate the autopilot. It'll safely take you through your mission and then out the extraction point.
[Sandy points to Squidward's butt on the computer screen. A red light blinks there. The submarine controls explode.]
SpongeBob: Um... we broke it.
[Patrick chops at it again with the axe. The scene returns to Squidward and Sandy.]
Sandy: [angrily] Stop it! What are you trying to do? Kill him?!
[Squidward starts sweating nervously.]
Sandy: [Over the speaker] This is approximately 17 times harder to drive than a boat mobile. Which you've never successfully done... [She nervously chuckles. The scene shows Sandy.] so, just take it nice and easy.
[The scene shows SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: No problemo! Nice and... EASYYYYYY!!!!!
[SpongeBob pushes the gas pedal to the floor making the submarine go as fast as it can. Both Patrick and SpongeBob are screaming as they head towards the brain, hitting Squidward's nasal cavity. The scene returns to Sandy and Squidward.]
Squidward: So, how's it going? [The sound of a vehicle crashing is heard. SpongeBob reverse the submarine, but is stuck in Squidward's brain. He successfully does so and the submarine flies backwards. They hit the side of Squidward's interior cranium and then hit Squidward's brain and this repeats for a while. Squidward's eyes become out of control.] I can't control my eyeballs!!
Sandy: Don't worry, it's temporary. Now, just sign this!
[She takes out a waiver. He signs it.]
Squidward: Okay... now what is this!?!
Sandy: Oh, just your autograph for when you're, uh... famous.
Squidward: Oh, of course. I've got [He takes out images of him wearing a sweater and a black jacket, holding a pipe.] head shots, you know. [He hands gets out of control and drops the pictures.] What the...!?
[He hits himself in the face.]
Sandy: Squidward!
[Squidward chokes himself. He punches Sandy, knocking her back. He hand starts freaking out.]
Squidward: What's happening?? [Squidward's brain is shown. The submarine hits Squidward's brain stem repeatedly. SpongeBob and Patrick are shown fighting over the controls.]
SpongeBob: Give me that!
Patrick: No, give it back!
[They start incomprehensibly yelling at each other.]
Sandy: They're hitting your central nervous system!
[Squidward punches himself.]
Squidward: Oh, ya think?
Sandy: You're not in control of your actions! [Squidward kicks Sandy's butt.] Hey!
Squidward: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not in control of my actions...
[Sandy gets mad at Squidward. The submarine hits the brain stem, which causes the submarine to bounce off it. SpongeBob and Patrick are shown, screaming. The scene returns to Sandy and Squidward. Squidward is spinning in the chair.]
Sandy: They've gone off course! [Squidward is flown off course. He is then shown spazzing out as the submarine enters his stomach.] Oh my gosh! You're out of control!
[The submarine lands in the stomach acid.]
SpongeBob: Eww, where are we? [Outside, Squidward's stomach rumbles. Inside, The submarine is getting dissolved in the green acid. Other food can also be seen being dissolved.] [As Patrick is screaming] MAYDAY! MAYDAY! WE'RE SINKING, AND PATRICK WON'T STOP SCREAMING!
Sandy: The stomach acid levels are way too high!
SpongeBob: The reserve tanks are almost empty. [Patrick grunts] PATRICK!
[Patrick is shown using the axe to chop at the tanks.]
Patrick: Finished!
Sandy: SpongeBob, you gotta get out of there. It's a straight shot up the stomach to the esophagus where the reed is. [A note plays] You can complete your mission if we can just access an alternative fuel. [through the speaker] Like natural gas.
[Patrick comes into the scene, holding a soda.]
SpongeBob: Natural gas?
[Patrick drinks the soda]
Patrick: Like this!
[Patrick burps.]
Squidward: Stop burping inside me, that's disgusting!
Sandy: Wait a minute, Squidward. He might be on to something.
Squidward: What?
Sandy: If you can make a big enough burp...
Patrick: We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here.
SpongeBob: Wow...
Sandy: He's right.
Squidward: What!?
Sandy: We're going through with your plan, Patrick!
SpongeBob: Yay!
Patrick: What plan?
[Squidward is shown drinking a bottle of soda. He puts it with several other bottles.]
Sandy: Now burp, Squidward! Lives are on the line!!
[Squidward tries to burp. Inside, the submarine is still digesting.]
SpongeBob: I never thought it would end this way... [Squidward burps loudly. A bubble forms below the submarine. It then engulfs the submarine. The reserve gas levels rise to maximum.] It's working!
[The submarine starts up and pops through the bubble and out of the stomach.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wheeeeee!
Sandy: They're headed for the esophagus! [She sniffs the air.] Phew, what have you been eating!?
Squidward: Morons.
[the submarine crashes into Squidward's throat where the reed is.]
SpongeBob: SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction.
[He swims out wearing a swim suit, floaties, goggles, and flippers.]
Sandy: Okay, you're going to have to go out and dislodge it somehow.
SpongeBob: I'm already on it.
[He takes out a hammer and hits the reed with it, repeatedly. A card that reads, "Two Hours Later" appears.]
French Narrator: Two hours later.
SpongeBob: This stupid hammer won't break anything.
[SpongeBob throws it at the reed. The hammer bounces back and cuts SpongeBob's floaties, making him bounce around. Patrick opens the hatch, wearing goggles.]
Patrick: SpongeBob, do what you were born to do. Dance!
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick! Whirlpool Spin!! [He cuts the reed in half like a buzzsaw with the spin, causing Squidward to cough it up.]
Sandy: [Over the speaker] Good work, guys. Mission accomplished. [The scene returns to her.] Now all you have to do is...
[Squidward pushes Sandy out of the way]
Squidward: Get out of my body! GO!
Patrick: "Grow"?
[He presses the grow button. The alarm starts up. The scene becomes a split screen. The left has Sandy, the middle has Squidward, and the right has SpongeBob.]
Sandy, Squidward, and SpongeBob: Noooooo!!!
[The scene goes black. The scene then changes to show the exterior of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [Off-Screen] Almost ready to open. [The scene then shows him finishing up polishing a golden sign that reads "No refunds".] There.
[The sound of a door opening is heard.]
Squidward: Good morning, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Hello, Squidward. Neptune's trousers! What's gotten into you? [The scene zoom out to show Squidward with a submarine-shaped body.]
SpongeBob: [inside Squidward] Reporting for Duty, Mr. Krabs.
[A toilet flushing is heard. Squidward gets angry.]
Patrick: [inside Squidward] Squidward, the toilet's backed up again.


[Scene opens to Patrick running around and giggling in the street]
Fish: [off-screen] Hey! [Patrick stops and looks around] Hey, you there!
Patrick: Uh, me?
Fish: Yes, you! [screams in Patrick's face] Get outta town! [Patrick screams and runs away. The fish scratches his head in confusion, then shrugs his shoulders. He turns to another fish who walks by] Get outta town! And take a vacation to beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. [hands the fish a flyer. Another fish walks up] Here ya go, sir. [hands him a flyer. The fish reads it. Scene cuts to Patrick running up to SpongeBob's house and opening the door]
Patrick: I gotta get out of town! [SpongeBob hands Patrick a glass of lemonade from the tray he was holding] Oh, thanks, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Sure, Patrick, ya... [Patrick screams and looks through the blinds on the window]
Patrick: I gotta get going! He told me to!
SpongeBob: Who did?
Patrick: Uhh, well, uhh... hmmm, I'm not sure. But he had a briefcase.
SpongeBob: Ahh, a briefcase?! He might be a paid assassin! [both start to cry] But, Patrick, you can't go! Not like this! Who will go with me to the next jellyfisherman's expo?! [shows a picture of the two at one of the exposes]
Patrick: It'll have to be one of your other chums 'cause my mind is set. [sobbing]
SpongeBob: Unset it, please unset it! [they bawl and wail. Patrick walks over to SpongeBob's kitchen counter and sets a suitcase on it to start packing]
Patrick: I guess I'll pack up my stuff and get ready to go. [puts two pairs of SpongeBob's pants into the suitcase] My clothes.
SpongeBob: Umm, Patrick, those are my clothes.
Patrick: [packs up a bunch of peanut butter] My peanut butter!
SpongeBob: That's my peanut butter.
Patrick: And my pickles! [stuffs a bunch of pickles into the suitcase and closes it, then falls on top of it sobbing]
SpongeBob: I can't believe you're leaving, Patrick. [cries] WITH ALL MY PICKLES!!!! [sobbing]
Patrick:  [heading for the door with the suitcase] It's the end of me being here.
SpongeBob: Wait! Stop! What about all our plans? [pulls out a list] 8:00am - Wake up Patrick, 9:00am - Eat Kelpo with Patrick, 10:00am - Brush teeth with Patrick, 1:00pm - Stare at Patrick. Who's gonna do all that with me?
Patrick: I'm sorry, there's no stopping the unstoppable. Patrick Star will live no more, forever... in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] But... what if you weren't Patrick Star?
Patrick: Oh, no. I'm not Patrick Star?
SpongeBob: You are Patrick Star, but you won't be for long.
Patrick: Huh? [scene cuts to SpongeBob putting a visor over Patrick's eyes]
SpongeBob: There ya go, Patrick. No one will know it's you. [Patrick looks in a mirror, screams at his reflection, then runs out of the pineapple through the wall, leaving a star-shaped hole. The part of the wall he took with him falls off and he collapses. SpongeBob gasps and runs over to him] Patrick, you okay? [Larry walks past]
Larry: Hey guys! Yo, Patrick, cool shades.
SpongeBob: Well, Pat, that disguise didn't work. We're gonna have to try harder.
Patrick: [takes off the visor] Yeah, well, thanks ol' SpongeBob for your help. It was a noble effort but alas, all in vain, it's no use. I must leave. [holds out his arms and runs past SpongeBob, who had his arms out to hug him, to pet a rock] Goodbye rock. Goodbye coral. [hugs a coral branch, but pieces stick to him] YOW! [holds a few strands of seaweed] Goodbye seaweed.
SpongeBob: Too bad we couldn't come up with a better costume. [looks at the seaweed] Hmmm...
Patrick: Goodbye sky. [SpongeBob walks up to Patrick and puts some seaweed on his head]
SpongeBob: That's it. With the seaweed on your head, you could be a...
Patrick: Oh, I know, I know! I could be Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. And live happily forever after in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Patrick, there already is a Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. [scroll over to a monster with seaweed all over his hair and chest]
Seaweed Monsterman: Hey!
Patrick: Darn!
SpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick. So you can't be a monster. But that vegetation on your head gives me an idea of what you can be. [scene cuts to inside a store] You're all set. Come on out, Patrick. [Patrick walks out from behind a curtain wearing a yellow-green skirt and top, red lipstick, and a blonde wig with pigtails. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick walking down the street]
Fish #2: Hi, SpongeBob. And hello, lady. [tips his hat to Patrick]
SpongeBob: The disguise is working, Patrick... I mean, Patricia. [both giggle. Larry walks up to them]
Larry: SpongeBob, you never told me you had a girlfriend.
Patrick: Oh, I'm not his girlfriend. I'm Pat...
SpongeBob:  [quickly]...tricia. Pat-ricia. Patricia! [laughs]
Larry: Bro, your girlfriend is not ugly. [Patrick giggles] 
SpongeBob: Actually, Larry, she's not my girlfriend, she's just a...
Larry: It's cool, buddy. You don't have to explain your girlfriend to me.
SpongeBob: But she's not my girlfriend.
Larry: I don't know why you're standing here talking to me when you could be talking to your girlfriend.
SpongeBob: C'mon, Patricia. [grabs Patrick's hand and walks off]
Patricia: Bye.
Larry: Congratulations on the new girlfriend, dude!
Mr. Krabs: [angrily runs up] SpongeBob! This is not the time for Sunday Stroll. It's time for work. [puts SpongeBob's hat on his head]
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't open for another two hours.
Mr. Krabs: [hands SpongeBob a spatula] There be no such thing as opening too early, me boy. Excuse us, miss. Huh? [looks back at Patrick. Sparkles form by Patrick's head and Mr. Krabs' eyes explode from seeing the beauty] SpongeBob, who's your friend?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, this is Patricia.
Mr. Krabs: [eyes inflate back to normal] Patricia. The most beautiful sound I've ever seen. SpongeBob, do we need any more help down at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: We do? Great, she can start right away. [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, where Squidward is reading the newspaper until he hears the door open]
Squidward: He- [looks surprised when he sees Patrick, then smiles and leans over the cash register] And who are you, my rubenesque beauty?
Mr. Krabs: That's Patricia, our newest Krusty Krab employee.
Squidward: Well, she sure is stunning. [Patrick is picking his nose]
Mr. Krabs: [sternly] Just keep your eyes on the customers, Mr. Squidward. [walks off. Patrick is cleaning off a table until Squidward walks up to him]
Squidward: Hi, Patricia. I drew this for you. [hands him a piece of paper] Likeness is uncanny, if I do say so myself. [drawing on the piece of paper is Squidward. A woman's scream is heard off-screen in horror of the picture]
Patricia: Uhh, thank you, Squidward. [Mr. Krabs comes out of the kitchen with two trays of food, one in each hand]
Mr. Krabs: Order up, Miss Patricia.
Patricia: Excuse me, Squidward. [eats the drawing, burps then walks off]
Mr. Krabs: [hands Patrick both trays] This order goes to table 7 and remember your manners. [Patrick walks up to a table with the number seven on it]
Patricia: [struggles to read the number] Forty... thirty...
Mr. Krabs: That's a 7, Patricia. [is sitting at the table]
Patricia: Mr. Krabs, you ordered two Krusty meals?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Did I order two meals? Oh, silly me. I can't possibly eat two Krusty meals, myself. [spreads a table cloth, with a radio, on the table] I guess you'll just have to help me finish all this food.
Patricia: Okay. [sits down. Mr. Krabs pushes a button and some music plays]
Mr. Krabs: Patricia, we may have only known each other for a short time, now, but I feel like a special connection has been made.
Patricia: [Eats tablecloth, Krusty Meals, candle, and radio, then belches loudly]
SpongeBob: Quite an appetite, but she's all woman. [scene cuts to Patrick walking in the kitchen with two orders. Squidward plays a soothing song on his clarinet. He scoots closer to Patrick and puts his arm around him]
Squidward: Eh? Ya know, Patricia, they don't call me the 'Sizzle Lips Squid' for nothing. [Patrick tries to leave, but Squidward stops him] So, are you free this Saturday night?
Patricia: No, that's the night SpongeBob and I are having a staring contest.
Squidward: SpongeBob?!
Mr. Krabs: [using a broken phone] Get back to work, you gold-bricking freeloader. Hut two, hut two, yah, yah! And don't come back 'til all the patties are krabby. [throws broken phone away] Well, now that we're alone, how would you like to be my date Friday night to a...
Patricia: Well, I can't. SpongeBob and I will be flying submarines that night. I have to get back to Krusting the Krab. [walks off] Man, why are those two so nice to me? They were never this nice to Patrick. It's weird. [opens the cabinet in front of him and notices Squidward inside the shelf]
Squidward: Are you sure about Saturday night? [Patrick closes the cabinet]
Patricia: Persistent bunch. [turns on the faucet, but Mr. Krabs peeks his head out of the faucet head]
Mr. Krabs: How about Sunday brunch?
Patricia: No thanks, again! [turns the knob again and Mr. Krabs' head disappears as the water flows out. He walks over to the toaster where Squidward's head pops up]
Squidward: But I made reservations for two at...
Patricia: I said no. [presses the lever down, making Squidward's head sink back into the toaster. Scene cuts to Patrick lifting up the fryer, where Mr. Krabs head is] No. [scene cuts to Patrick using the water hose on the floor when Squidward's head pops out from a hole on the ground] No way. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs in a water job] No. [scene cuts to Squidward in the toilet] No. [scene cuts to Patrick in the middle of the Krusty Krab] NO! [Patrick walks into the kitchen] What is it about me that makes those two so friendly? It must have something to do with this disguise. I can't wear this any longer.
SpongeBob: But if you reveal your secret identity, you'll have to leave Bikini Bottom!
Patricia: Well, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I just can't live like this anymore. I'm tired of pretending to be someone I'm not. [opens the door to the dining room of the Krusty Krab. All the customers look up and greet him excitedly]
Fancy Fish: The lovely Patricia [blows a kiss] has returned to us!
Patricia: I have an announcement to make. The entire day that I've worked here I've wanted to say... [is struck speechless when he notices the fish from the beginning, giving out flyers, has entered the Krusty Krab] Um-um-um-uh... [the fish sits down at a table] I've wanted to say that, uhh, th-that... [nervously twirls one of his pigtails, presses his hands together, and scratches his head and arm] That I will eat any leftovers on your plate! [smiles and walks away]
Customers: Huh?
Sunny Seashores Salesfish: Ahoy, waitress, aren't you gonna take my order?
Patricia: I'll be right there, sir.
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Patrick?
Patricia: That's the guy with the briefcase. The guy who's trying to run me out of town.
SpongeBob: [gasps] The assassin!
Patricia: [walks up to the customer] What can I get you, sir?
Sunny Seashores Salesfish: Say, don't I know you from somewhere?
Patricia: No!
Sunny Seashores Salesfish: Hmmm... that's it! Get outta town!
Patricia: He's onto us.
SpongeBob: I won't let you do it. You'll have to do something horrible to me before I let you throw Patrick out of town.
Squidward &amp; Mr. Krabs: Patrick?!
Sunny Seashores Salesfish: You forgot your flyer. [hands them one of his flyers]
SpongeBob: [reading flyer] Get outta town! To beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. Look, this guy wasn't trying to run you out of town, he just wanted to sell you a luxury vacation at a modest price.
Patrick: Well, I guess I don't need this disguise anymore. [rips off his disguise. Everyone gasps while Squidward's eyes shrink in horror]
Squidward: Umm, I think I need to take a shower.
Mr. Krabs: So, let me get this straight, uh, you're not a woman?
Patrick: No.
Mr. Krabs: Well then, you're fired. Uhh, if anybody needs me, I'll be in my office for, I dunno, the next 20 years or so.
SpongeBob: Hey, buddy, what do you say we go home and get started on this list? [Patrick and SpongeBob look at list and gasp at what is on it]
Patrick and SpongeBob: Yaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhoooooooo!


[Squidward peeks out his door to make sure SpongeBob is not around]
Squidward: It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here. [crawls around to SpongeBob's downstairs window. Peeks in but sees SpongeBob is not there] Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening. [cut to Squidward in his house in a robe] Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television. [slurps his drink while watching Kelpy G on TV about to play his clarinet. When he does, SpongeBob's laughter is heard instead of a clarinet sound. SpongeBob and Patrick are outside playing]
Patrick: Do it again. Do it again.
SpongeBob: Okay. [puts two handfuls of sand in his mouth then squirts it out of his head like Play-Doh hair]
Squidward: Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television. [closes window]
Patrick: Do it again, do it again.
Squidward: If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that. [watches more of the squid with the clarinet. Pounding on the door causes the music to stop. Squidward gets up and answers the door] What?
SpongeBob: Squidward! [Squidward slams door in their faces. Patrick sighs]
Squidward: You're still there, aren't you? [opens door]
SpongeBob: Good evening, Squidward.
Squidward: Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening.
SpongeBob: Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?
Patrick: Yeah. We're here... [Squidward slams the door]
Squidward: Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone? [sits on his couch then notices SpongeBob and Patrick] SpongeBob?! Patrick?! Oh, what's the point? [SpongeBob and Patrick slurp their drink while watching the squid with the clarinet on TV]
Patrick: Could you turn it up?
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?
Patrick: Squidward, what's this about?
SpongeBob: Squidward, how come he's so emotional?
Patrick: Is he the bad guy?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Patrick: Squidward?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Patrick: Squidward?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Patrick: Squidward?
Squidward: [screams] That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen! Once again, I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet! [grunts] Enjoy my TV! PFAH!
Patrick: Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.
Squidward: I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. PFAH! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement. [rides into a cement truck full of cement] Oh. [cement unloads on top of Squidward. Squidward tries to get unstuck and is launched through coral field, a sewer pipe, and into a colorful group of jellyfish, who sting him. The cement around him dries and becomes concrete. He falls over and screams out a bubble, then he talks in his thoughts.] Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob. [reads sign] Jellyfish Fields. [sighs]
SpongeBob: What is that thing, Patrick?
Patrick: I dunno. Let's get a closer look. [both run up to the thing as it's trying to escape]
SpongeBob: Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob. [sniffs in the odor coming from Squidward then flushes the tears away. Squidward’s muffled growling causes SpongeBob and Patrick to scream] Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him.
Patrick: Yeah, help him. Go away! Can't you tell nobody wants you?! You're endangered!
SpongeBob: Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him. [muffled shouting coming from Squidward. Cut to SpongeBob's house] Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly. [muffled whimpering from Smelly] Here's your food bowl.
Patrick: And some kibble. [pours in some food]
SpongeBob: You can live here forever and ever. [Smelly cries] Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met. [retrieves Gary] Smelly, meet Gary. [Gary sticks to Smelly] Aww, look at that, Smelly, Gary likes you. [Gary screeches and attacks Smelly] Gary, no! [gets Gary off of Smelly] Gary! [Gary hisses]
Patrick: I don't think Gary likes Smelly.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here.
Patrick: Ah! He can come live with me.
SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Patrick. You’ve always wanted a pet. [Smelly tries to escape through the door, but keeps falling down] Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house. [opens the door] Bye, Smelly. Have fun at Patrick's.
[Patrick is dragging Smelly to his house while Smelly tries to get into Squidward's house, but Patrick pulls him away.]
Patrick: No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets. [cut to under Patrick's rock] Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch? [throws ball at Smelly] Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. [throws ball at Smelly again] Almost. [throws ball at Smelly again] Again. [throws ball at Smelly again] So close. [throws ball at Smelly again but it gets stuck in his eye] Yeah, now you're... [Smelly throws the ball at Patrick, knocking him down] Smelly! What's gotten into you?! [screams and jumps behind a chair and calls someone] Hello, Animal Control?! There's a wild animal loose in my house! [person over phone is speaking gibberish] Sure, I'll hold. [Smelly escapes Patrick's rock] Smelly! Come back! Smelly!
Police: Freeze! [more police cars arrive]
SpongeBob: [reading in his library] Hmmm, what's all the commotion? [looks outside the window]
Police: You're surrounded. There is no way out.
SpongeBob: Smelly. [tries walking through a crowd of policeman] Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal.
Police: Wild animals don't belong here, son. They belong in the zoo. Get 'em, boys. [Smelly is taken away in a truck marked 'ZOO' with a vicious, giant clam]
SpongeBob: Smelly. [cut to the zoo where people are around the habitat of Smelly. Smelly is locked behind a cage marked 'Species Unknown']
Isabelle: Mommy, what is that thing?
Sadie: I don't know but it's hideous, isn't it? [everyone laughs. Smelly angrily goes back inside his cage]
SpongeBob: This isn't good.
Patrick: You're absolutely right. [takes out a hot dog] It needs mustard.
SpongeBob: No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is. [whispers to Patrick. Cut to night where Patrick and SpongeBob are wearing black ski masks] Okay, Patrick, remember the plan?
Patrick: Oh, yeah. [takes out a hotdog] This one, right?
SpongeBob: [grabs hotdog] No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison.
Patrick: [takes a bite out of the hotdog] Mmm, good plan.
SpongeBob: [ties rope to rail] All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me. [climbs down the rope]
Patrick: You're my hero. [gets tangled in the rope] SpongeBob! Help! Ah! [screams and makes lots of noises]
SpongeBob: Shh, we'll get caught.
Patrick: What?! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud! [SpongeBob pulls the rope which causes Patrick to fall straight to the ground which, in turn, wakes up Smelly]
SpongeBob: [tip-toes over to Smelly's cage] Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home. [draws a home with his fingers. Smelly moans] Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick. [he does so. Cage door opens and they carry him out] Smelly, you're free! [lights are shining on them, they jump out a little with a seal barking sound]
Police: You're surrounded. There's no use trying to run.
SpongeBob: Run, Patrick, run! [as they do, the police climb down into the habitat and chase them] Faster, Patrick. [notices a manhole cover and opens it]
Patrick: I'll let Smelly go first. [throws Smelly down the sewer. Smelly bounces around before hitting the ground]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us. [Patrick closes the manhole cover as police run by it]
Patrick: I think we lost them.
SpongeBob: Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads.
SpongeBob and Patrick: La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la. [Smelly moans and whimpers]
SpongeBob: Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much. [muffled screaming and wailing from Smelly]
Patrick: Hey, I see light.
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we? [a group of creatures are gathered around in the distance] Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us. [creatures turn around to reveal they look like Smelly] Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way. [push Smelly on the ground as the group of creatures take him away]
Patrick: [sniffs] I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob: Me too, buddy. Me too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong. [the group of gray creatures put Smelly down to where the squid on TV from earlier is playing jazz]
Kelpy G: Ah... salutation, my children. Are you ready for your daily dose of smooth jazz? [excited murmuring from the creature. Kelpy G plays. As he is playing, Smelly's exterior breaks and reveals Squidward underneath]
Squidward: [chuckles nervously] Um... hi.


SpongeBob: [holding a pan over the stove] Come on, stovie, pop that corn! [popcorn bag grows enormously huge] Get ready, Gary. [trips over Gary landing in the chair] Incoming! [popcorn bag explodes everywhere]
Gary: Meow. [popcorn ricochets everywhere and piles up to SpongeBob's waist]
SpongeBob: Popcorn is served! [eats a piece of popcorn while music plays on TV]
Medley: That, bro, is trouble at any car wash.
TV Announcer: We will return to "Bikini Bottom Car Wash" after these messages.
Commercial Announcer: Are you boring?
Charlie: Yes, yes I am.
Commercial Announcer: When friends describe you, do they use words like... [words appear as they are being said] "dull!" or "drab!?"
Charlie: [laughs] Don't forget "platitudinous". [word appears over his head. A mystical head floats beside Charlie]
Commercial Announcer: Yes, that too, Charlie. But what if I told you that you can change all that with the magic of... magic! [turns Charlie into a magician]
Charlie: [laughs] I look like some kind of magician. Now people won't ignore me.
Commercial Announcer: Let's hope not, Charlie. With my "Mister Magic Magical Magic Kit", even you can impress and amaze your friends.
SpongeBob: [holds on to the TV] I want to impress and amaze my friends!
Commercial Announcer: Just send $19.95 to me, Mister Magic. [SpongeBob puts an envelope into the mail slot, then takes the post office mail can and stuffs it in 'Outgoing Mail']
Narrator: 4 to 6 weeks later...
Mailman: One magic kit and another one of these yellow things. [stuffs both into SpongeBob's mailbox then drives off]
SpongeBob: [gets out of his mailbox and rips the packaging off the box that came in the mail] Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit. [opens the box and gasps] Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic. [notices Squidward to the side slurping a drink] Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill.
Squidward: Brine soda, low-fast seaweed crisps, cool jazz. [eats a seaweed crisp] Mm, mm, Squidward you have done it. You have officially spoiled yourself rotten.
SpongeBob: Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic!
Squidward: Magic? Can you make yourself disappear, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard. [Squidward's eye twitches] No, I better start with something simpler. [gets out a deck of cards] Say card conjuring. [Squidward is now depressed more than ever] Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see... [reads his book of spells] step 1...
Squidward: [sighs] This can't possibly end soon.
SpongeBob: Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist, Mister Magic. [juggles the three balls in and out of his holes on his body]
Squidward: [steps onto the bus that just pulled up] I don't care where I'm going, just take me away from here. [bus drives off]
SpongeBob: Then take one card and shove it in your ear. [does so. A car drives by with Tom in the driver's seat and his son Monroe in the passenger seat bawling]
Monroe: But I don't like pistachio!
Tom: Then why did you ask for it? [drives into a bump, which causes the ice cream to fly out the car and into Squidward's lawn chair. Monroe starts crying loudly]
[The pistachio ice cream cone lands in Squidward's sunbathing chair]
SpongeBob: And finally, say the words "Hobris-Pobris." [gasps] Squidward! My simple card-trick has turned you into an ice cream cone. Which means... I am a level ten wizard! I suppose I should change you back to squid form. [looks at his book of spells] Presto! [nothing happens] Uh, let's see. Umm... A-ha! Alakazam! [gasps] Abracadabra. [gasps] Okilee-dokilee. Hobra-cobra. Oh! Open sesame. Change-o back-o to Squidward-o, please-o? Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. [sniffs, tears up] I've transformed you into a delicious dairy dessert and I can't change you back! There, there, Squidward. There is no need to cry. I promise you will continue your normal life despite the fact that you are now edible. [cut to "The Reef" where SpongeBob and Squidward, as an ice cream cone, are watching a movie. Ice cream cone tilts over into SpongeBob's arm and makes him smile. Cut to SpongeBob reading Squidward a story. Cut to the beach where SpongeBob and Squidward are lying on a towel trying to get a tan. SpongeBob looks over and notices melting ice cream cone] Whoa-oh! [a beach goer, who is trying to catch a Frisbee, slips in the ice cream cone. SpongeBob screams, then runs over to Squidward] Squidward! Speak to me! Speak! [breathes heavily as he runs to his house and puts the cone in the freezer] Hey, Squid, are you okay? [closes freezer door then reopens it] Hey, Squid, are you still okay? [winks, then closes door, reopens it again screaming then laughing] Hey, Squidward, I got something for ya! Someone to keep you company in that drab ol' freezer. [set a pink ice cream cone next to Squidward] Oh, aren't they cute? I promise to stand by as an eternal guard over my buddy.
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?
SpongeBob: I have turned poor Squidward into a frozen dessert.
Patrick: That's awful. How tragic. Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: It's all my fault.
Patrick: Did you say frozen dessert? [takes the green ice cream cone out of the freezer]
SpongeBob: Yeah. I turned him into a tasty soft-serve with a waffle cone. [cries]
Patrick: Oh...soft serve. [licks ice cream cone]
SpongeBob: [yells as he points to the ice cream] Patrick! Stop eating Squidward!
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [licks it a few more times]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick licks it again] Pat...!
Patrick: But he's so tasty! [licks it more faster. SpongeBob screams, then he snatches the cone away from Patrick]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! Don't you understand!? [calmly] This isn't just your ordinary ice cream cone.
Patrick: It's pistachio.
SpongeBob: [frustrated] No! It's Squidward! [ice cream begins to melt as SpongeBob is unaware] And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged. [Patrick is licking the melted ice cream off the floor. SpongeBob screams again, believing that his friend was deceased.] Patrick! Squidward has melted! Quick, call the police. What am I going to do?! Oh, Neptune, it's all my fault! What have I done?! What have I done?! [screams and hits himself in the face with the magic kit each time] It's all your fault! [throws the magic kit on the ground and stomps on it] Curse you, Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit! Curse you! Hey, that's it! That's the answer to our problems!
Patrick: [examines the torn box] Warning: From ages 9 to 99.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, the one mystic being that can help us: Mister Magic! [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick walking down a brown tileroad] Just follow the brown-tiled road to the most mysterious mystic of them all! No one's ever seen him in person.
Deep Male Voice: Enter! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a floating hat] Who dares to see Mister Magic?! [SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming] Speak up!
SpongeBob: It is I, SpongeBob of the SquarePants, Magician Level 1. And I have turned my friend into ice cream. [he shows him the cone floating in the melted green goo inside a jar, which is his "deceased friend"]
Mister Magic: [proudly] Good job.
SpongeBob: Well, thank you, but well, I can't change him back.
Mister Magic: Hmmm, um, well, have you ever thought of a different hobby?
SpongeBob: I need your help to change him back.
Mister Magic: My help? [sheepishly] Uh, no thank you.
SpongeBob: [still concerned] But if you don't, my friend will be a cone forever.
Mister Magic: Sorry, I... umm... I'm out to lunch, that's it.
SpongeBob: I'll wait.
Mister Magic: I'm on a two-year lunch.
SpongeBob: [still showing the jar] Oh, please.
Mister Magic: Silence! [Patrick notices something near the wall and walks to it]
SpongeBob: But, sir, no one else has your power of sorcery. [Patrick opens the curtain to reveal someone behind it making Mister Magic noises]
Mister Magic: Thank...you.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, there's a guy over here talking into a tubey thing.
Horace: Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.
Mister Magic: [simultaneously with Horace] Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.
Patrick: Why's he saying the same thing Mister Magic's saying?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir?
Horace: Well, I... uh... I'm Horace B. Magic.
SpongeBob: Are you Mister Magic?
Horace: [chuckles] Technically, yes. But the only magic around here is the magic of business. [shows a bunch of dollar bills]
SpongeBob: Does that mean you can't change my friend back?
Horace: [chuckles] I'm, I'm afraid not. So sorry about that, laddie. Your refund check is in the mail.
SpongeBob: I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways! [his eyes tear up] You have ruined my faith in the magical arts. [screaming, crying]
Horace: [frowns] Security. [SpongeBob and Patrick are booted out. Cut to both of them by Squidward's lawn chair with SpongeBob still crying over the "funeral" held for "Squidward"]
SpongeBob: [tears roll down his cheeks] What are we going to do about Squidward?
Patrick: We could always eat him. I'm kind of hungry. [stomach growls]
SpongeBob: Mister Magic was a fake and all his magic stuff is fake! All those magic words, they were fake. Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby, murkery, fool, magic of bloob-jiggacacies!... [continues to speak gibberish as a bus drives up and Squidward steps off, grinning in a friendly manner. He walks over to the lawn chair with the jar and the melted green ice cream, much to his disgust]
Squidward: Ew. [throws the jar with the cone in it away. The jar breaks] What are you doing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [stops crying] Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked. [puts on his magician hat] I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now? [motorcycle approaches]
Squidward: Hey, stop! [motorcycle stops and Squidward jumps on it] Get me out of here!
Patrick: [stomach growls] Hey, SpongeBob? I'm still hungry. Can you turn me into a jar of mayonnaise so I can eat myself?
SpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica. [Patrick is now a giant jar of mayonnaise. The jar sparkles]


Narrator: It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: I'm ready! [walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School with Patrick] I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?
Patrick: Right here, buddy. [takes them out of his pocket] Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards. [eats the cards] Mmm.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick!
Patrick: Hey, learning tastes good.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I needed those.
Patrick: Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.
SpongeBob: 57 times.
Patrick: Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.
SpongeBob: I'm a winner?
Patrick: Who's a winner?
SpongeBob: [sadly] I'm a winner.
Patrick: Who's a winner?
SpongeBob: [cheered up a little] I'm a winner.
Patrick: Who's a winner?!
SpongeBob: I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! [runs into the classroom]
Narrator: One minute thirty seven seconds later... [SpongeBob walks up crying]
Patrick: How'd you do, winner? [SpongeBob's crying continues] Let's see that license.
SpongeBob: I didn't get a license, Patrick.
Patrick: Are they gonna mail it to you?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.
Patrick: No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.
SpongeBob: Let's just go home, Patrick.
Patrick: We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.
SpongeBob: [hanging onto Patrick's pants] No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. [Patrick's pants rip off]
Patrick: Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. No!
Mrs. Puff: [Patrick walks up to the boat she is sitting in and gets in it, in his underwear] Good morning.
Patrick: You're not the judge of me!
Mrs. Puff: Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! [clicks her pen. Scene cuts to SpongeBob, outside the boating school]
SpongeBob: I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?
Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'm here for you, buddy.
Patrick: I passed my test!
SpongeBob: You got a perfect score?
Patrick: Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.
SpongeBob: Perfect score. [eye twitches]
Patrick: Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. [scene cuts to the license registration building]
Miss Shell: Stand behind the line, sir.
Patrick: [smiling] How do I look?
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Like a winner.
Miss Shell: Ready?
Patrick: Ready. [banner comes down which says "CONGRATULATIONS" on it. Balloons and confetti fall]
SpongeBob: Huh?
Fish: Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.
Patrick: Does that mean I get a free key chain?
Fish: Uhh, no.
Patrick: Oh.
Fish: You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.[Patrick runs up to the new boatmobile as SpongeBob's jaw drops]
Patrick: Yeah! All right!
Fish: Women will want you. [all sigh] Men will want to be you. [all faint] You'll be the envy of your friends. [SpongeBob growling angrily]
Patrick: Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.
SpongeBob: I'm so happy for you... ["La Cucaracha" horn blows in his face] Whoa!
Patrick: The horn works. [scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road] Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
Patrick: Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.
SpongeBob: Two millionth?
Patrick: Then you can get a free boat just like me.
SpongeBob: Yeah, just like you.
Patrick: I try to serve as an inspiration to others.
SpongeBob: Can we go home now? [zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over] We've been driving around your house for hours.
Patrick: I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. [shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. [SpongeBob groans and slam his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am]
SpongeBob: 4:00? [yawns. Doorbell rings] Who could be at the door at this hou— [falls down the stairs. Opens the door] Now what is it, Patrick?
Patrick: You will never guess what happen to me today.
SpongeBob: You got your license.
Patrick: Yeah! [shows his license] But that's not all.
SpongeBob: You got a new boat.
Patrick: Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. [walks off]
SpongeBob: [gets back into bed] Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. [foghorn alarm blows]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. [scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work] I'm so tired. [horn honks]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. [tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride.
Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. [SpongeBob is getting very angry]
SpongeBob: That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.
SpongeBob: When did we get a drive-thru?
Mr. Krabs: I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.
SpongeBob: I used to have a dream.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.
SpongeBob: [through headphones] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— ["La Cucaracha" horn honks]
Patrick: The horn still works. [scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform] Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What's with the helmet, Patrick?
Patrick: Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. [clicks tongue]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [scene cuts to Patrick driving]
Patrick: Boy, driving is so easy.
SpongeBob: Oh?
Patrick: Do you want me to give you lessons?
SpongeBob: [sarcastic] Oh, that would be great.
Patrick: Oh! [drives over to SpongeBob's parents]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.
Mr. SquarePants: Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?
Patrick: What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.
Mrs. SquarePants: That's great, Patrick.
Patrick: SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.
SpongeBob: Mom!
Patrick: Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.
SpongeBob: Hey. [Patrick drives off]
Mr. SquarePants: Even Patrick has a license. [both parents sigh]
Patrick: Let's see what this baby can do. [steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH']
SpongeBob: Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
Patrick: Yeah, yeah.
SpongeBob: [reads the speedometer] 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. [car stops next to a policeman]
Patrick: What? Where? Who?
SpongeBob: Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
Officer: Umm... okay. [uses radar gun. It reads 0mph] Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. [drives off]
SpongeBob: Are you sure you don't want to run him in? [scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red] It's a red light, Patrick! [Patrick runs through red lights] Patrick, you just ran three red lights!
Patrick: So?
SpongeBob: You're suppose to stop!
Patrick: I think the driving genius knows what he's doing.
SpongeBob: [finally snaps] Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
Patrick: They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?
SpongeBob: I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
Patrick: How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!
SpongeBob: If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
Patrick: I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! [takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises]
SpongeBob: [fixes his face and then snatches Patrick's license out of his hand]Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! [tears up Patrick's license then laughs. The pieces of the license fly into the cop's hands.]
Officer: Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. [drives off after SpongeBob &amp; Patrick]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: It's the police!
Officer: [over speaker] Pull it over, litterbug!
Patrick: Litterbug?! No! [drives faster]
Officer: Ooh, I got me a runner. [a bunch of police cars are following him]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
Patrick: I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. [drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom]
Judge: 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.
Patrick: So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.
SpongeBob: What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! [runs up to the judge] Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
Judge: Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! [a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail]
Narrator: One debt to society later... [door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob! [both hug]
SpongeBob: I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. [shows him a license plate that reads "PALS 4 EVER"] Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.
Patrick: Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.
SpongeBob: Oh, then what do we do with this? [Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind]
Patrick: How's that?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Patrick: Ready, buddy?
SpongeBob: Ready, pal. [hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises] Woo! Woo!


[A humanized pink starfish in a suit walks up and knocks on Patrick's rock.]
Patrick: Yeah?
Starfish: Good day, sir. I am...
Patrick: [gasp] I know exactly who you are! [closes rock]
SpongeBob: Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gare-Gare.
Lady on TV: Jason, I have to be honest. There's someone else. [grabs an elderly fish]
Man on TV: Grandpa!
Patrick: [pokes head out of TV] SpongeBob, help! He's onto me! I don't have much time! [pants. Makes a fire in SpongeBob's living room and burns some of his books]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I have to get rid of these books! [shows 'HOW TO READ' book]
SpongeBob: Why?
Patrick: I'll show you why. [shoves SpongeBob's face into his window looking at the pink starfish] See him? He's from the library. He knows about my overdue books. [SpongeBob gasps] Uh-huh. Which means I'm gonna get thrown into the big house. And you know what that means...
SpongeBob: Small portion meals?
Patrick: Exactly! [crying]
SpongeBob: Patrick, don't you worry. I got your back, man. [later, SpongeBob approaches the starfish outside] Hi there.
Starfish: Salutations, young one. Say, you wouldn't happen to know that starfish that lives under this rock, would you?
SpongeBob: Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this "alleged" starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books. [SpongeBob slams his hands over his mouth]
Starfish: [chuckles] Well, it's too bad you don't know Patrick Star, because I am from the Royal Ministry, and have a gift for him. [takes out a crown]
Patrick: [runs through SpongeBob's wall] Ooh, what is it? [takes it and tries to bite and lick it] This is the worst-tasting gift ever!
Starfish: That's because you're suppose to wear it, not eat it. Allow me to show you something. [the starfish searches around in his pants] Let's see here. Aha! What I hold in my hands is a family tree that goes back centuries. It starts with the marriage of King Amoeba and Queen Mildew. Then, through a few inbred generations, ends at you, Sir Patrick, which makes you a descendant of royalty. You are a king. And now it's time I adjourn to the Royal Ministry, where I should be at your service. Your Highness. [the starfish bows and leaves]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, that's great!
Patrick: What is?
SpongeBob: That you're king!
Patrick: What's a king?
SpongeBob: When you're a king, you can get anything you want.
Patrick: Anything I want? [stomach grumbles] SpongeBob, do you think we can get something to eat?
SpongeBob: Your wish is my command, your majesty. [laughing. Cut to Krusty Krab where SpongeBob enters with medieval clothes on] Good townspeople, let us rejoice in welcoming our new king. [Patrick enters, wearing his crown and a royal cloak]
Patrick: King needs food badly.
Mr. Krabs: What's this all ab... [gasps. Sees Patrick's crown and dollar signs appear in his eyes] Well, well, well. What can I do for you, Patrick?
SpongeBob: The king would like...
Mr. Krabs: Zip it, SquarePants... I'm talking to the rich guy.
Patrick: I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries...
Mr. Krabs: I've got a better idea. [cut to a bunch of food on the table and Patrick chewing loudly] A buffet fit for a king.
Patrick: [belches] Tasty.
Mr. Krabs: Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down. You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to.
Patrick: Uh-huh, that sounds great. Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?
Mr. Krabs: [holds a check] How about you pay the check, instead?
Patrick: Oh, sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do. As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want. Isn't that right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free.
Mr. Krabs: All free?!!? [kicks them out] Nobody eats in me restaurant for free, king or no king! [Harold walks out with a drink and Krabby Patty]
Patrick: Are you gonna eat that?
Harold: I was planning to, why?
Patrick: I want it. [takes them]
Harold: Hey! What gives you the right to take my food?
Patrick: [eats the Krabby Patty] Tell him, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about.
Patrick: I thought you said I could have anything I want. Was my bestest friend lying to me?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you.
Patrick: Good! Now tell him.
SpongeBob: Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants. [chuckles]
Harold: This isn't fair. [walks off]
Patrick: Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it.
Fish: I finally did it! At long last, I've acquired issue #2 of Wonder Space Fish, and in mint condition. Now my 40 year-old life and my comic book collection are complete. Mom's gonna be so proud of me. [bumps into Patrick]
Patrick: No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!
Fish: But, I've spent my entire life collecting those.
Patrick: Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it. I'm the king!
Fish: I will cry about it. [crying] I'll cry right to my mom! [runs off, cries]
Patrick: [laughs] I love being king.
[Cut to the jewelery store where the owner is examining a diamond. SpongeBob then shows him the decree and he gives it to Patrick, who puts it in his belly button. Then, SpongeBob takes some lollipops from some kids and Patrick starts licking them. Then SpongeBob shows the decree to Martha Smith, who sadly gives her baby to Patrick, who then takes out the baby's pacifier and gives the wailing baby back to her. Then Patrick takes a plunger, a toaster, and dentures. Soon, a long line of people are standing with things to give to Patrick in front of his rock, which now has a castle tower fixed to it]
SpongeBob: Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker.
Old Man Walker: I hope so. Neptune knows I did. [falls over] Oof!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, sire?
Patrick: [slurping a drink and reading a magazine] I need your opinion on something. Do you think the giant flat-screen TV should go over the fancy egg display or the indoor swimming pool? [cut to Squidward sleeping then waking up to birds chirping and the sun shining]
Squidward: Hello, sunshine. [chuckles then yawns as he walks over to his window] What a beautiful morning. Just perfect. [Squidward falls over from side to side in his house. Patrick is using a crane to move Squidward's house out of the way]
Patrick: Back. Back. Okay. Yeah, that's good. [crane drops the house] Perfect. [Squidward climbs out of his upstairs window]
Squidward: [stuttering] My-my-my house. What's happened to my...huh? [he sees SpongeBob and Patrick. He growls their names] SpongeBob, Patrick.[explodes] What the barnacles is going on here?! Look at what you've done. Look at my poor front yard.
Patrick: Your front yard?
SpongeBob: Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel.
Squidward: Ferris Wheel?!
SpongeBob: I know, isn't it great?
Squidward: No, it's not great! It's horrible! Oh, that's it! Stop! People of Bikini Bottom, stop! Stop! Patrick's no king. Look at him. How can this pink blob be king?
Patrick: [looking stupidly] Uh...
Squidward: [Rushes to a worker, on his knees, and grabs his shirt.]You. Do you honestly believe that that mindless starfish can possibly be the king of anything? [Patrick puts his hand in his mouth.] King of Morons, maybe.
Worker: He might be on to something.
Squidward: Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, see? Uh-huh. See? [Squidward then notices that the crowd willingly agrees.]
Crowd: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Man: Why are we giving this guy all our stuff? [The crowd angrily walks away.]
Squidward: See? See? You're not a king. And now, they all think so, [long pause] too!
Patrick: [enraged] Get him! Attack! Attack! [panting with Squidward giving a confused facial expression.] SpongeBob, get him! So I decree. Attack!
SpongeBob: Uh, right away, your majesty. [SpongeBob rushes towards Squidward.] Umm, Squidward?
Squidward: [gritting his teeth] What?
SpongeBob: Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick?
Squidward: [takes decree] Give me that! A treaty, huh? Well, here's what I think of your treaty! [As he rolls it up and shoves it onto SpongeBob's face. Cut to inside Patrick's castle where SpongeBob has the treaty stuck in his forehead.]
Patrick: [rage takes over] My royal subjects have deserted me. And it's all 'cause of that horrible Squidward. This is all his fault. His, his, not mine, his! [crackling, bangs]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what's happened to you?
Patrick: I don't know what you mean.
SpongeBob: Uh... [laughs] You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and...
Patrick: And what...
SpongeBob: [intimidated of Patrick's rage] And, um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk.
Patrick: Huh? [laughs] I thought you were going to say I was abusing my power.
SpongeBob: Uh...well, I...
Patrick: [explodes] Who's saying I'm abusing my power!? [SpongeBob shrinks and Patrick rips off his cloak] I'll put the whole town in prison! [SpongeBob runs away] Questioning my authority is reason! All these giggly speeches are making me thirsty. SpongeBob, I request a drink. SpongeBob? [claps twice] SpongeBob?! Huh. Gee, everybody's gone. I'm all alone. Fine, I'll get it myself! [walks by the mirror, and his reflection looks like a monster]
Mirror: Knock knock.
Patrick: Huh? [gasps] A knock knock joke! [he runs back to the mirror] Who's there?
Mirror: You.
Patrick and Mirror: I don't get it.
Mirror: I'm you and you are me. [a wire in Patrick's head connects and short circuits]
Patrick and Mirror: [screams] What have I become?! [Patrick races out of his rock]
Patrick: Aaah, help! Monster! Monster! [he bumps into the Royal Ministry starfish] Huh? Oh, it's, it's you! [he thrusts the crown at the starfish] Here, here, take it. I don't want it anymore. It's turned me into a monster.
Starfish: Oh, I think I know what's going on here. Patrick, with great power comes great responsibility. [Patrick is shaking and whimpering] You haven't a clue what I just told you, do you?
Patrick: No. Uh-uh.
Starfish: Oh, just as well. I've come to take the crown back, as it seems that you aren't royalty after all.
Patrick: Huh?
Starfish: [takes out family history] I've discovered this coffee stain, which upon removal, reveals that Sir Gary is the true heir to the king's crown. [he removes the stain to show Gary's picture on the family history parchment. Cut to Gary having a crown put on his head, SpongeBob and Patrick dressed in medieval clothes]
SpongeBob: Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty!
Gary: [smiles] Meow?


[The beginning opens up to bikers riding by coral, setting them on fire as they ride by.]
SpongeBob: [at Jellyfish Fields] La la la la la. [attempts to catch a jellyfish] Missed ya. Uh-oh. [notices road] You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over. [motorcycles approaching. As they do, SpongeBob hangs onto ones jacket] The "Ild Ones"! That's a strange name. [jacket tears] Scallop! [rolls in the cement] Bye "Ild Ones." I like your silly name. Hmm..."w." Oh, oh, they're not the "Ild Ones." They must be the "Wild Ones."
Fish: [dressed in farmer outfit with a pick-ax in his hand pops up] The Wild Ones?! Tar nation! Don't you know who the Wild Ones are, son?!
SpongeBob: No; I don't know who you are, either.
Fish: Why, they're the most ferocious, bloodthirsty biker gang under the sea. They've destroyed entire cities in an afternoon! [laughs maniacally and then jumps back into the hole he was digging]
SpongeBob: Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut! [as the next scene of bubbles comes up, so does SpongeBob. Bubble pops inside of the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?
SpongeBob: There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!
Mr. Krabs: Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?
SpongeBob: Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!
Mr. Krabs: What are you going on about? Bikers?
SpongeBob: The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea.
Mr. Krabs: Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it? [cuts to later where a sign hangs that reads 'WELCOME WILD ONES!'] Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, this is serious! [cries and runs out]
Mr. Krabs: That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course. [cuts to The Wild Ones 25 miles from Bikini Bottom. Cuts once again to SpongeBob in front of Squidward's house.]
SpongeBob: Squidward! [knocks on door]
Squidward: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: A horrible biker gang called the "Wild Ones" are coming. We've got to run, hide! [crying]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, my. This sounds serious. Luckily, I know just what you should do. Listen closely.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Squidward: Get a good grip on your pants. [SpongeBob does so] Turn around. [SpongeBob does so]
SpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?
Squidward: That's it. [kicks SpongeBob into the air. Cuts to SpongeBob landing next to Patrick, who is sniffing under his arm]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: [turns his back and crosses his arms] Huh.
SpongeBob: Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?
Patrick: Oh, I heard you. But what didn't hear was a hello.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Hello, Patrick.
Patrick: Hello, SpongeBob. [realizes] Bloodthirsty bikers! Ah! We got to hide! [both run and scream then run into each other. Both run and scream again and keep hitting each other until they run through Jellyfish Fields. Patrick and SpongeBob hide in a giant clam until it spits them out. The giant clam uses mouthwash after that]
Giant Clam #2: Hey, what happened to you?
Giant Clam #1: [groaning] I... I don't want to talk about it, man. [SpongeBob and Patrick fly through kelp grass. As they hide in it, a mower comes by and mows them over, then uses a leaf blower to blow them into a pile. Both reform into their shapes and scream more]
Patrick: [jumps behind SpongeBob] Hide me!
SpongeBob: [jumps behind Patrick] No, hide me!
Patrick: [jumps behind SpongeBob] Hide me!
SpongeBob: [jumps behind Patrick] Me!
Patrick: [jumps behind SpongeBob] No, me!
SpongeBob: [jumps behind Patrick] Me!
Patrick: [jumps behind SpongeBob] Me!
SpongeBob: [jumps behind Patrick] Me!
Patrick: No! No more running.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats [holds his pants] and their leather pants. [points to head]
SpongeBob: [holds up a black sock] Their leather socks.
Patrick: If we dressed up like that, then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.
SpongeBob: Say that again, Patrick.
Patrick: Little baby doody-heads?
SpongeBob: No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers. [Scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick putting on biker clothes. SpongeBob and Patrick put on biker pants, SpongeBob stretches his barefeet toes out to put on his biking boots, Patrick puts on a bike jacket, and then they put on biking helmets] What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough?
Patrick: I wouldn't mess with ya.
SpongeBob: Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride. [cuts to later where Patrick and SpongeBob are revving their engines in the streets of Bikini Bottom. Zooms out to show they are riding bicycles] Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here.
Harold: Ooh, I feel protected now.
Scooter: Those are some mean looking rides, dudes. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's working. They think we're... vicious bikers. [cuts to Krusty Krab where they both enter inside] Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here.
Patrick: [drools] See?
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's your salivation.
Patrick: Oh.
SpongeBob: So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?
Squidward: Does that part include laughing at you? ‘Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.
SpongeBob: Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?
Patrick: I'm bloodthirsty. See? [shows a cup with the word 'BLOOD' on it. He takes a sip] Want some?
SpongeBob: Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood. [both take sips of their drinks] See, Squidward? We walk the walk, but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?
Squidward: No, I don't.
Patrick: What about our biker club?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: How about our biker organization?
Squidward: No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, your outfits, or your fellowships.
SpongeBob: What about our coalition?
Patrick: Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.
SpongeBob: [takes out clipboard] We'll just pencil you down as undecided. [Squidward groans and walks away] Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone.
Mr. Krabs: This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.
SpongeBob: Then can we save the town?
Squidward: Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?
SpongeBob: Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react? [flashback shown] Squidward! We're out of napkins! [screams] Out of napkins! [another flashback to SpongeBob banging on Squidward's door] Squidward! I accidentally removed the "Do Not Remove by Penalty of Law" tag on my mattress! Hide me! Hide me! [another flashback] Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind! [Squidward turns on lights] Oh. Thanks, Squidward. [back to present]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. It's one of your many annoying traits.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Me? Annoying? [annoying laughter. Squidward growls] Yeah, right.
Squidward: You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way. [motorcycles approaching] What was that?
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there, mateys. Motorized vehicles headed over the horizon.
Squidward: What? [grabs binoculars] Gimme that. [sees them coming. His eyes pop through the binoculars as he screams] Don't just stand there, save us!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as we do it together. [Patrick is already running away] Patrick? Patrick! [Patrick is headed into Jellyfish Fields and to the bus stop where a bus picks him up and takes him to a plane. Patrick jumps out of the plane and onto a rocket ship] Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we...
Squidward: Panic! Run for your lives! [customers gasp] The Wild Ones are coming! [everyone screams and runs]
Lenny: The Wild Ones? [jumps into a sardine box] Mable, get the kids! [Mable jumps into the sardine box with Susie and Tyler and then closes it]
Charlie: Honey, I got the napkins. Oh, what have I missed this time?
Squidward: [running out of the Krusty Krab] Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket. [shows a shirt with a skull on it] I want to ride to live and live to ride. [screams as the bikers ride in a circle around him] I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.
Biker #1: What's that, missy?
Biker #2: What?
Biker #1: Howdy, we're the "Mild Ones".
SpongeBob: Mild Ones? [turns the W upside down] Oh!
Biker #1: Gimme back my M. Let's go, boys.
Mr. Krabs: Don't you want to spend any money?
Biker #1: Don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants? Let's ride. [bikers ride off]
SpongeBob: Goodbye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?
Squidward: Woo-hoo-hoo! [riding with the biker gang] Ride to live and live to ride!


[At the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money a dozen times, and it still comes up short. Profits are down. Oh, I feel sorry for me self. [walks out of office]
Squidward: Would you like a drink with that order?
Wobbles: Oh no, thanks. I got me one of those new KelpShakes before I came in here.
Squidward: That comes out to two dollars even.
Wobbles: Wow, what a steal.
Mr. Krabs: What the...why didn't that guy order a deliciously over-priced fountain beverage with his krabby patty?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we haven't sold a single soda in days.
Mr. Krabs: [Shocked] What? Why not? [Mr. Krabs sees SpongeBob slurping a soda can loudly] All right, boy, it's done! You're gonna suck the whole cup down your gullet if you're not careful.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr Krabs, it's just that this KelpShake tastes so good.
Mr. Krabs: KelpShake?
SpongeBob: Look around ya. Everyone's enjoying a delicious KelpShake. [everyone is slurping their KelpShakes] Mm-mm. I'll be right back, Mr Krabs. I'm gonna get a refill.
Mr. Krabs: Refill? That's it. Listen up, everybody! New rule: No outside drinks. No exceptions! [everyone leaves with their KelpShakes]
Squidward: That's telling them.
Mr. Krabs: Grr. I better get to the bottom of this. [Squidward secretly sips his KelpShake when Mr. Krabs leaves. Mr. Krabs walks outside] Ah! A new store! [store is shaped like a KelpShake] On my block! Taking my customers. [gasps] Pearl. [Pearl walks by while drinking a KelpShake] Me own flesh and blood. How could you do this to your papa?!
Pearl: What are you talking about, Dad?
Mr. Krabs: I'm talking about this. [points to KelpShake]
Pearl: Once you taste the secret goodness of a KelpShake... [slurping] You can't have just one.
Mr. Krabs: Let me see that. [tries taking the KelpShake from Pearl, but she pulls it back]
Pearl: Buy your own.
Mr. Krabs: Why I wouldn't give them a cent.
Pearl: I feel sorry for you.
Mr. Krabs: Then you do understand. [starts to cry and grovels at her feet]
Pearl: Dad, you're embarrassing me. [drags her dad a few more feet before prying him off] Oh, get away. [Mr. Krabs is still crying]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no! Confound you, new KelpShake store. What's your secret? [gasps] Of course. Plankton, I bet he's behind this. A-ha! I knew you were behind this!
Plankton: Pardon me, I've done nothing wrong.
Mr. Krabs: Then how do you explain this? [points to the KelpShake restaurant]
Plankton: Holy Moley, how'd that happen?
Mr. Krabs: Don't try that with me, Plankton. This new store is ruining me business.
Plankton: Really? Wait a minute?! That's my job! [groans] Blast it! It's bad enough I have to compete with this joker. Now there's this?! KelpShakes.
Mr. Krabs: Wow. I guess you're really not behind this after all. Plankton, they have... a secret formuler.
Plankton: No, not another secret. And if there's a secret, I want to know about it! [rumbling]
Mr. Krabs: Oh!
Plankton: [gasps as one KelpShake store multiplies itself to have two KelpShake stores] They're multiplying. Why, they're on every corner.
Mr. Krabs: Block after block.
Plankton: They're everywhere.
Mr. Krabs: [a KelpShake store falls on both of them] We've got to do something about this. [cut to later where Mr. Krabs and Plankton walk into a KelpShake store] You sure this is going to work?
Plankton: Just stick to the plan.
Mr. Krabs: [whistles] Oh, let's see, let's see. Ah, there you are. [spots an 'employees only' sign. Whispers to Plankton] Plankton, I think I found the kitchen.
Plankton: Let's do this thing!
Mr. Krabs: Here goes. Wa-choo! [sneezes on a mom and daughter] I'm sorry, I have a bit of a [gasping] ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...choo!! [continues sneezing on everything. he sneezes Plankton at the door window, but Plankton was unable to get into the kitchen]
Employee: Eww. [sprays a cleaner at Plankton]
Plankton: [screams] My eye, my eye, my eye! [Mr. Krabs and Plankton run out and hide behind the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: I think we lost them. Well, you got any more bright ideas?
Plankton: Of course I do. [cut to nighttime where Mr. Krabs and Plankton are wearing black ski clothes]
Mr. Krabs: All set, Plankton?
Plankton: You better believe it. This high-powered mechanical bio-arm I invented should pry those restaurant doors open nice and easy. [presses a button that makes the hand move. The hand short-circuits] What the barnacles? Come on, you piece of garbage. [presses the button many times. The mechanical bio-arm slaps Plankton a bunch of times] Ouch! Uncle! Uncle!
Mr. Krabs: [Sighs] If you want anything done right, you've got to do it yourself. [takes out a crowbar and tries to open the doors, but his back pops] Oh, me back. [moaning]
Plankton: [whispering] Krabs, pipe down. You're gonna soil our plans if you wake up the watchdog. [guardworm is sleeping]
Mr. Krabs: Never mind that. What about SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr Krabs. Hi...Plankton? Uh, Mr Krabs, I'm a little confused. Don't you and Plankton hate each other?
Mr. Krabs: Of course we do.
SpongeBob: Then why is he in your fist? [Mr. Krabs and Plankton come up with a good explanation]
Mr. Krabs: Uh...we've gone into business together. You see, SpongeBob, we were hired, uh...to fix this door.
Plankton: Now we have to fix the roof. [winks]
Mr. Krabs: That's right. That's right. We have to fix the roof. It's, it's, it's leaking. [crickets chirping]
SpongeBob: Well, good luck with that. See ya. [cut to later where Mr. Krabs is using jackhammer to get into the roof]
Plankton: Keep her going, Krabs. At this rate, we'll have the Kelpshake's recipe faster than you can say... [speaker comes up from under the roof]
Speaker: You have three seconds before spontaneous combustion. [a laser gun comes out]
Plankton: Let's beat it!
Mr. Krabs: No kidding. [runs]
Plankton: Wait, you forgotten... [gets zapped and disintegrates. Cut to the next day where a line of people are ordering KelpShakes. Plankton is under one of the tiles on the floor. He laughs maniacally until the customers step the tile, causing him to get squished, making him scream. Cut to Mr. Krabs lowering Plankton by a rope through the vent. Plankton is about to take a sip of a KelpShake when the customer takes a big sip first, swallowing Plankton. Plankton opens the customers mouth and is raised up through the vent. Cut to Mr. Krabs blowing Plankton through a hose and out of a sink pipe. When Plankton gets out, he is covered with KelpShake juice and gets drowned in the disposal] I'm throwing in the towel, Krabs! All these convoluted plans are getting us nowhere. And to top it all off, I'm the only one that's taking the heat!
Mr. Krabs: What's that suppose to mean?
Plankton: I don't see you on the front lines. Sure, let me do all the work, while you just sit back like the fat gorilla you are!!
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Plankton] Who you are calling a gorilla, you one-cent, one-eyed bottom-feeder!?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if you want a KelpShake, why don't you just buy one? [slurps his KelpShake]
Mr. Krabs: [Scared] Buy one?! [cut to later where Mr Krabs and Plankton are in line at the KelpShake store]
Customer: I'll have one KelpShake, please.
Mr. Krabs: I don't know about this, Plankton.
Plankton: It's easy. Just smile and hand the cashier the money.
Cashier: Can I help you?
Plankton: Good luck.
Mr. Krabs: Hi there. Uh, could I get one KelpShake?
Cashier: Sure, that'll be one dollar.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, okay. [gets out a dollar and slowly hands it to the cashier]
Cashier: [cash register dings] Thank you. [The cashier tries to take the dollar but Mr. Krabs is not letting go of his dollar.] Sir, please let go of the bill.
Plankton: Release your grip, man. Do it! [Mr. Krabs does so and groans as the money is taken. The cashier puts the dollar in the register and hands the KelpShake to Mr. Krabs]
Cashier: Enjoy.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks. [runs out laughing] I can't believe we did it.
Plankton: Oh, believe it, Krabs. Now let's get to the lab and find out what this stuff is made of. [scene cuts to the KelpShake on a plate where a sample of the drink goes through a tube, into chemistry bottles, and finally into Karen where she begins a D-N-A scan] What's the secret ingredient, Karen?
Karen: Well, it appears that the main ingredient is, Kelp Juice.
Plankton &amp; Mr. Krabs: Just kelp juice?
Mr. Krabs: And to think this whole time I could've been selling these meself!
Plankton: You? What about me? If anyone, I deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff.
Mr. Krabs: [removes the glass container and takes kelp juice] No way, pipsqueak. This gold mine is mine.
Plankton: Not if I can help it. [jumps at Mr. Krabs, but goes between his eyes and splatters into the wall] Ow.
Mr. Krabs: [cackling] Nice try. [about to take a sip]
Karen: I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's another ingredient.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, I paid good money for this thing. Of course I'm gonna drink it. [takes a sip then spits it out] What the...? I don't get what the big deal is. This tastes like a wet gym sock.
Plankton: Really? Let me try that. [Plankton sips the drink and puckers his lips] Actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste.
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm. [sips again] Hey, you're right. This ain't half bad. [takes another sip and laughs] This is amazing.
Plankton: Well, don't be selfish. [sips and laughs] Oh yeah.
Karen: Oh no.
Plankton: [he sips in the rest of the drink until he sucks in the cup] Krabs, we're all out of juice.
Mr. Krabs: Well, we gotta get more.
Karen: You're making a big mistake.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, phooey. You don't know what you're talking about. [he walks out with Plankton] KelpShake, KelpShake. Oh how I love a KelpShake.
SpongeBob: [runs up crying covered in yellowish-green fur] What's happening to me? [Mr. Krabs and Plankton gasp when they see SpongeBob covered in green kelp and he's naked] They've shut down the KelpShake restaurants! [nearly crying as he runs off]
Plankton &amp; Mr. Krabs: Huh? [They both see workers sucking out all the liquid in the KelpShake restaurant that says CLOSED FOREVER]
Hazmat #1: It'll take decades to clean this hazardous material up.
Hazmat #2: I sure do feel sorry for whoever drank this. [Mr. Krabs screams as he is growing yellowish-green kelp fur just like Plankton is, then Plankton screams]
Plankton: Look at us!
Mr. Krabs: Now what are we going to do?
Plankton: I don't know about you, [Plankton takes out a mini helicopter propeller] but I'm going back to what I do best. Stealing your recipe. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, wait a minute! Plankton!
Plankton: [he flies into Mr. Krabs office where the safe is, he tosses the propeller and laughs] Come to papa. [Mr. Krabs opens the door]
Mr. Krabs: Hold it right there. You're not going anywhere... [He opens the safe] without a ten second head start.
Plankton: It's good to be home.
Mr. Krabs: You said it.
Plankton: [he runs off as Mr. Krabs begins to chase him] I love being hated.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, get back here you little booger! [laughs]


SpongeBob: [A bus arrives at Jellyfish Fields] You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets. [gasps as he sees a blue jellyfish] Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter! A two fisted Jumper! And a gold-throated stinger!
Gold Throated Singer: La, la, la, la, la, la, la!
SpongeBob: Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one! [SpongeBob and Patrick are over-shadowed]
Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob? [looks up and sees a bunch of colorful jellyfish above them]
SpongeBob: Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable! [opens his case to a metal net instead of one made of bamboo sticks. He catches many jellyfish while Patrick struggles to catch one. Scene cuts to the bus stop.]
SpongeBob: Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.
Patrick: Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net. [his net breaks]
SpongeBob: Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloy netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.
Patrick: Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky. [shudders. Scene cuts to the bus dropping off Patrick and SpongeBob on their street]
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick.
Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [in his bed] Ah, I love jellyfishing. [night breaks into day quickly and the foghorn alarm goes off] Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable. [realizes he doesn't have it] Ol' Reliable? [gasps] It's gone! [runs out the door in his underwear]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, right. Pants.
Narrator: One pair of pants later...
SpongeBob: Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen! [both scream. Scene cuts to them stapling posters saying "STOLEN! OL' RELIABLE"]
SpongeBob: Put one over there, Patrick.
Patrick: I'm all done.
SpongeBob: Maybe we should spread out a little. [newspaper ad of the "Bikini Bottom Gazette" reads "STOLEN OL' RELIABLE" on the front page]
Johnny: Flash. The jellyfish migration enters it second day of fantastic jellyfishing. We now go live to our reporter on the scene.
Perch Perkins: [in Jellyfish Fields] This year's migration is the largest in a century! I feel truly sorry for the poor saps that will miss even one minute of this remarkable event. [SpongeBob takes Perch's microphone]
SpongeBob: Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return. [Mr. Krabs sees this on TV at home and runs to Jellyfish Fields then appears on TV instantly]
Mr. Krabs: Reward? How much we talkin' about?
SpongeBob: 12 dollars and... [counts the coins] ...38 cents.
Mr. Krabs: I'm on the case. [takes SpongeBob's money and runs off screen while Perch takes back his microphone]
Perch Perkins: Guys, I know it's a slow news day, but come on. [The scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in his chair by the phone when it rings. He picks it up.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Hello? Hello?
Patrick: SpongeBob, did you get your net back?
SpongeBob: Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [hangs up. The phone rings again] Did you get your net yet?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. [hangs up. The phone rings again]
SpongeBob: Hello?!
Patrick: SpongeBob, I found your net!
SpongeBob: What?! Really, Patrick?
Patrick: Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever. [looks out his window and notices Patrick running around with a jellyfish net]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net. [gets in bed] Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday. [his eyes widen. Scene cuts to morning. Patrick walks up to SpongeBob's pineapple]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?
SpongeBob: [sighs] No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net? [Patrick laughs then stops]
Patrick: No. [SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.
Patrick: A present? What is it?
SpongeBob: [pulls out a bear with a microphone in its hand] It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.
Patrick: Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.
[He quickly dashes off to speak for the bear.]
SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Hi! My name is Confess-A-Bear! Tell me all your secrets.
Patrick: Um, [sits on the ground] I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened.
SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Oh, maybe you should talk about it.
Patrick: Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out.
SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear!
Patrick: I've said too much already.
SpongeBob/Confess-a-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear now! Now!
Patrick: [screams] I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear? [SpongeBob runs around in the background screaming and wiping his tongue off in disgust] You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear? [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Patrick's rock]
SpongeBob: Patrick, we need to talk.
Patrick: Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!
SpongeBob: Hmmm... [walks down some stairs into Patrick's rock] Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?
Patrick: I'm in here. Be out in a second. [Patrick's shadow reveals himself holding a jellyfishing net]
SpongeBob: Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.
Patrick: [Standing with his hands behind his back] Hello.
SpongeBob: What's in your hand, Patrick?
Patrick: [shows his left hand] Nothing.
SpongeBob: What's in your other hand?
Patrick: [grows another arm through his chest] Nothing in my other hand.
SpongeBob: Well, I gotta go.
Patrick: Okay, bye.
SpongeBob: Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he? [imagines Patrick from earlier]
Patrick: I would kill for a net like that! [takes out a carrot, breaks it in half, and laughs maniacally]
SpongeBob: [screams] Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure. [scene cuts to the next day] Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick: Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What are you going to do today, buddy?
Patrick: Eh, nothing.
SpongeBob: [puts on his Krusty Krab hat] Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick.
Patrick: Bye. [SpongeBob walks off then sneaks into a bush in the background]
SpongeBob: Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants. [looks through binoculars]
Narrator: Eight hours later...
SpongeBob: [still looking through binoculars] Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go? [Patrick is behind him]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?
Patrick: Nothing. I just finished. [takes out his to-do list and crosses out 'Nothing'] Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here. [shudder] Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?
SpongeBob: [yells and throws away the binoculars] I don't have any binoculars, see?
Patrick: You're acting weird.
SpongeBob: I'm not acting weird! You're acting weird! [runs off panting] You're... acting... weird!
Patrick: Okay, bye! [later, SpongeBob knocks on Patrick's rock] Hello! Who are you?
SpongeBob: [wearing a mustache. British accent] Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean.
Patrick: Oh. No.
SpongeBob: Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies hmm.
Patrick: What street said that? Was it this one? [points at the street] Mind your own business!
SpongeBob: Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net. [shows a fake $1,000,000,000 bill that is colored on with crayon] I will pay one billion dollars for that net.
Patrick: I don't know who you are, but you're not getting this jellyfishing net! [holds the jellyfishing case out] I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar!
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Patrick: You can't have it for any price.
SpongeBob: And why not?
Patrick: This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.
SpongeBob: [rips off the mustache. Normal voice] A-ha!
Patrick: SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions.
SpongeBob: Patrick, [puts on the mustache] I'm the scary mustache guy!
Patrick: [screams] Why, SpongeBob, why?! Why would you wear such a scary mustache?
SpongeBob: [rips off the mustache] Why did you steal my jellyfishing net?!
Patrick: What?! I'm your best friend!
SpongeBob: You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!
Patrick: How could you think that?
SpongeBob: Because you said it! You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!
Patrick: Gift.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: It's my friend SpongeBob's gift. [opens the case up to reveal a new jellyfishing net] I made you a new net.
SpongeBob: [reads inscription] For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you! Patrick? [a bunch of stuff is on the ground]
[Patrick puts the TV in the pile.]
SpongeBob: What'cha doing, best friend?
Patrick: I'm not your best friend. I'm a no-good jelly netting thief fish!
SpongeBob: Where are you going?
Patrick: I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! [bus stops in front of them] So, this is it?
Patrick: Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.
SpongeBob: [hands onto Patrick's left foot] Patrick, don't go! I'm sorry I accused you! It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me.
Nat Peterson: What's the holdup? Oh, it's you two. [shows SpongeBob his net] Look, you left your net on the bus again.
SpongeBob: Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?
Nat Peterson: You do it every week. Now can we get going?
SpongeBob: Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by.
Patrick: You're giving me Ol' Reliable? [cries loudly] I accept your apology!
SpongeBob: Oh, come here, you big lug! [both hug and cry loudly]
All: Aww...
Nat Peterson: They do this all the time. I'm serious. I--ugh, never mind.
Patrick: I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!
Passengers: Hooray! [bus drives off]
Patrick: You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net. [holds up Ol' Reliable]
SpongeBob: So did I. [holds up the one Patrick made for him] My best friend made it for me.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Whee! [Both laugh and run into Jellyfish Fields, where the exotic jellyfish are still there.]


Squidward: [sighs happily] I love waking up to my own circadian rhythm without the aid of an alarm clock. [notices SpongeBob standing next to his bed]
SpongeBob: Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward? [SpongeBob is spit out of the island head, into the air.] Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later! [cuts to Squidward planting. Right before he puts in a plant, he sees SpongeBob's face in the hole] Hi, Squidward, wanna play?
Squidward: No, and leave me alone! [puts the plant in the hole, covering SpongeBob's face. Then a flower springs from the ground with SpongeBob's face on it.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, see ya later. [cuts to Squidward in front of a canvas]
Squidward: Ah, the blank canvas. Infinite possibilities. All of the colors of the known and unknown universe hiding on my palate. The artist approaches, ready to create. [right before he begins to paint, SpongeBob's face appears on the canvas]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, wanna play? [Squidward paints a giant red 'NO' on the canvas] Okay, Squidward, see ya later. [cuts to Squidward in his library]
Squidward: [sighs] Perhaps I can find solitude in the printed word. [Opens book and SpongeBob jumps out]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, wanna play? [Squidward shuts book, with SpongeBob in it, and puts it back on the shelf. Muffled] Okay, Squidward, see ya later. [cuts to Squidward in his bathtub while playing with his nose. He notices SpongeBob watching him from his window and screams] Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob, you hide first. [closes the curtain] Oh, no, where'd he go? I guess he wins. [laughs] Defeat has never tasted so sweet. [phone rings] Yello? [SpongeBob's mouth pops through the receiver into his ear]
SpongeBob: How 'bout a game of hangman?
Squidward: How 'bout a game of hang up? [slams down phone] Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating. [as he walks out of the bathtub, he is sprayed in the face with mud. SpongeBob is drilling into his bathroom]
SpongeBob: How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks &amp; Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings &amp; Queens? Mahjong? [Squidward is beginning to fume and he picks up SpongeBob and shakes him angrily] Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?
Squidward: It's called, "I will never play with you... [yells in SpongeBob’s ear] ...ever!" [throws SpongeBob into the hole and moves the refrigerator over it]
SpongeBob: Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward... [jumps out of hole] I'll just make one of my own! [fridge falls on top of Squidward, squishing him. He squirms out from under it and sees SpongeBob running back to his house]
Squidward: I think that moron finally gets it! I don't want to see or hear him for the... [pneumatic tools whirring and grinding are heard from SpongeBob's house. Squidward walks over to his house] SpongeBob! Will you make that racket stop?! SpongeBob, you open this door right this... [door opens and knocks Squidward down]
Mini Squid: Hello, Squidward. [Squidward screams and hides behind a bush] Squidward! It's me, Mini Squidward!
Squidward: What are you doing, SpongeBob?
Mini Squid: Hello, Squidward.
Squidward: What manner of annoying scheme is this?
SpongeBob: Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is.
Squidward: Hi. Now, SpongeBob, what the...?
SpongeBob: Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name.
Squidward: [sighs] Hello, Squidward.
Mini Squid: Wondrous weather we're having, eh, Squidward, old pal?
Squidward: SpongeBob, what is the meaning of this?
Mini Squid: SpongeBob made a replacement you: me. So when you you don't want to play, SpongeBob will play with me-you.
Squidward: So, you'll be filling in for me when SpongeBob wants to play one of his stupid games?
Mini Squid: Yeah.
Squidward: Oh, Thank you, thank you, thank you! [kisses Mini Squid then runs off laughing hysterically] Woo-hoo-hoo! [pole vaults through his house window. SpongeBob and Mini Squid look at each other. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mini Squid sitting next to SpongeBob's pineapple playing charades]
Mini Squid: [Spongebob shows three fingers] Three words. [moves his hand as if he was rolling the hand crank of a movie camera] Movie title. [Spongebob nods that all are correct; gasps] "12 Angry Jellyfish."
SpongeBob: How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you.
Patrick: [to Mini Squid] Squidward, you look a little different. Wow. Have you been working out?
SpongeBob: Actually, Patrick, this is...
Patrick: D'oh, hold it, SpongeBob. Ooh, I know. You shaved your beard. [SpongeBob and Mini Squid look at each other. Scene cuts to Squidward working at the Krusty Krab serving Krabby Patties to a couple, sounding monotone.]
Squidward: Alright now, who has the Krabby Patty and who has the Krabby Patty? [The customers are silent and look irritated] See... 'cause... they're both... krabby. [SpongeBob and Mini Squid walk in]
SpongeBob: Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?
Mini Squid: Of course, I am. I love to work!
Sandals: Who is that little fellow with SpongeBob?
Suzy Fish: I don't know, but isn't he handsome?
Sandals: Yeah, he is handsome. [Squidward starts mumbling] Ahem.
Squidward: Oh, sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
Sandals: No. I don't like your attitude, bub. Is this what the Krusty Krab calls friendly service? [Mini Squid pops up from under the cash register]
Mini Squid: Sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
Sandals: Now that's more like it. Finally, a server with a good attitude.
Mini Squid: Well, thank you very much.
Sandals: I'll take eight dozen of your finest patties, please. But don't let old chowder pants over there touch them. He might taint the patties.
Squidward: Fine then. Do my work for me. [puts his hat on Mini Squid's head and walks away]
Squidward: I'm starting to like this Mini Squid doing my work, keeping SpongeBob off my back. I could get used to this.
SpongeBob: Order up, Mini Squid!
Mini Squid: Okay, SpongeBob. Always happy to help. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Here you go, pal! [flips six patties on Mini Squid's plate] Go get em', tiger! [Mini Squid walks over to the customers]
Mini Squid: Okay, now, who had the Krabby Patty, and who had the Krabby Patty? [both fish laugh]
Squidward: [alarmed and irritated] What the...? That's my joke!
Sandals: Wow, honey, this new Mini Squidward is such a card!
Suzy Fish: And a great waiter, dear.
Sandals: Yeah. You're right. So much better than that old, lousy, larger-scale Squidward. [Squidward mumbles angrily]
Suzy Fish: Yeah! Bring that little fella over here and let me give him a $300 dollar tip! [shows $300]
Squidward: What? All right, all right! [he has Mini Squid back off] That's enough! My break is finished. [walks behind cash register]
Squidward: Oh boy! Back to work!
Mr. Krabs: Hold on a second, there.
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... Squidward, me cephalopod, I'm sorry to tell you this — well, not that sorry — the customers prefer the new smaller Squidward to you. And so do I! 'Cause he's making me some bucks! So I'm changing your job to busboy, effective immediately. [hands Squidward dirty dishes] Now pipe down and watch how it's done.
Mini Squid: Hey, everybody! I'm Squidward and I love to dance.
Jimmy Gus: I, for one, love to watch people dance while I eat. Who's with me? Who wants Mini Squidward to dance for our amusement? [everyone cheers]
Mini Squid: Well, gosh, okay. [SpongeBob changes Mini Squid into a purple aerobics outfit. Mini Squid starts dancing when the music starts. Some customers dance the same thing Mini Squid and SpongeBob are dancing]
Squidward: What's the big deal? Those are all my moves! [dances the exact same moves but no one is impressed] Ta-da!
Fred: [gasps] Talk about no talent!
Harold: Maybe Squidward should get sized-reduction surgery so he'll dance better! [everyone laughs]
Squidward: That Mini Squid... [Mini Squid continues to dance and plays the clarinet to everyone's amazement]
Mini Squid: Everybody dance! [everyone dances. Music stops and Mini Squid takes a bow]
Squidward: That was awful! [all cheer for Mini Squid and Squidward begins to fume as confetti cows down and party horns sound]
Squidward: He stole my jokes... he stole my job... he stole my standing ovation! You little wooden fiend! Stop stealing my life! [walks over and does bodily harm to Mini Squid before an agent shows up]
Milo: Stop, stop! Don't gnaw on the head of my new client, please! You don't know what you're doing. Are you mad? Have mercy!
Squidward: Wait a minute. I've seen you before. You're that music agent that represents my favorite clarinet player.
Milo: Salutations! I'm Milo J. Finkerfish: manager for "Curly Bubbles Records."
Squidward: You mean you're here to sign me up for a record deal?
Milo: The answer to that question is a big N-O. [points to Mini Squid] This little fella on the other hand is woo-hoo woo-hoo good! We're offering him a million dollar contract and a sequin suit.
Squidward: [gasps] A sequin suit?! That's what you're supposed to offer me! Why take a cheap knock off when you can have the original. [plays "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" from Cinderella on his clarinet and dances]
Squidward: Now, where do I sign? [Milo laughs]
Milo: Yeah, right, kid! [takes Mini Squid]
SpongeBob: Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies! [laughs] Remember?
Mini Squid: Yep, those were the days.
SpongeBob: But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. [speaks Italian] Arrivederci, [speaks French] mon frere.
Milo: Alright, kid, let's go become a sensation. Oh, and I'll see you at the Clammy Awards. Oh no, I guess I won't. [laughs, coughs and leaves]
SpongeBob: [Squidward cries] Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?
Squidward: My dreams are crushed. But, hey, at least I won't have to see that Mini Squid ever again!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I have something even better! [takes out a mini SpongeBob] Another me! [Mini SpongeBob and SpongeBob laugh back and forth while Squidward's eye twitches]
