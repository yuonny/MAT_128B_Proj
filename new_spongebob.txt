[Transitions to the Krusty Krab, which is surrounded by boats. In his office, Mr. Krabs is checking his money records. He hears shouting from outside.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm. Sounds like a mutiny. [he goes outside and gasps] What the...?! [The restaurant is filled with customers shouting angrily] What in Neptune's knickers is this?! [A customer grabs him]
Frank (lifeguard): Where's the dude in the boat, man? Where's the dude in the boat?!
Mr. Krabs: Ooooh! You mean Mr. Squidward. [he turns and points] Well, he's at his post right over the... [the wooden boat is empty] Where's me cashier?! [He looks down at the Frank, who's still holding his arm. He glares at him, and pulls his arm away. Mr. Krabs bursts into the kitchen] SpongeBob! Where in Poseidon's pantyhose is that sorry excuse for a cashier?!
SpongeBob: Sorry excuse for a cash-?" Ooh! You mean Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Yes. I mean Squidward. Where is he?!
SpongeBob: He's in the storage room. Says he's working on something requiring... [in a whisper] ...complete privacy.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. He requires, privacy does he? [the sound of a chain snapping is heard, followed by a loud crash. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs burst into the storage room] What's all the ruckus?! [A shelf has partially collapsed, and there are buns scattered in a heap all over the floor. Squidward emerges from the pile, rubbing his head and groaning. Mr. Krabs gasps] Oh no! Please, no! This is terrible! [he bursts into tears] Are you hurt?
Squidward: Oh, well. Thank you for ask-
Mr. Krabs: I wasn't talking to you! [He picks up some of the buns] Don't worry, papa's here. [he bursts into tears again]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs continues sobbing] Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs sobs even louder] Mr. Krabs! [he stops sobbing] Your shelf collapsed on me, and I twisted my ankle! [He lifts up his tentacle, which is badly twisted]
Mr. Krabs: I didn't even know you had ankles.
Squidward: As if working here wasn't bad enough, now I've been injured on the job.
Mr. Krabs: Injured? On the job?! Oh no! That would mean...
SpongeBob: It's all right here, Mr. Krabs.[Mr. Krabs turns and looks as SpongeBob moves some boxes aside to reveal a poster with "OWS" written on it] The Bikini Bottom OWS Worker Safety Guidelines. Let's see, it says here...blah blah blah blah, accident... blah blah blah blah, owner negligence... blah blah blah blah, substantial fines.
Mr. Krabs: Substantial fines?! [he turns back to Squidward, laughing nervously] You know, Squidward... uh... I can't really let the OWS hear about this, you know. [laughs nervously. Squidward smirks]
Squidward: Really? Maybe I should give them a call. [picks up a phone]
Mr. Krabs: Now now, Squidward! [laughs nervously] Let's not be hasty! [Squidward puts down the phone] I'll take care of your poor little ankle personally. [he turns around] SpongeBob! Squidward needs first aid! [SpongeBob looks delighted]
SpongeBob: First aid? Fear not, injured co-worker, [he runs over to Squidward, now wearing a hospital hat and jacket and a stethoscope] for I am certified.
Squidward: Oh, no no no, don't touch me! [SpongeBob grabs Squidward's nose and runs his stethoscope over it] SpongeBob, would you mind letting go of my nose?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure. [he lets go of Squidward's nose, and it flies back, hitting Squidward]
Squidward: Ow! [he takes the end of SpongeBob's stethoscope and shouts into the end of it] Get away from me! [SpongeBob shakes from the yell and hits his eardrums to make it stop] Well, this is it! I am reporting you to the OWS!
Mr. Krabs: [screams] Please don't report me to the OWS. I'll do anything. Anything at all ya ask.
Squidward: Hmm? Anything? [cuts to scene where Mr. Krabs lays Squidward down]
Mr. Krabs: Now if you want anything, just ask. [laughs nervously then walks away]
Squidward: I could sure use a pillow. [Mr. Krabs comes back to Squidward with a pillow. He places the pillow on Squidward's back]
Squidward: And one more for my foot.
Mr. Krabs: Well, sure thing. [comes back with another pillow which is placed under Squidward's twisted foot] Okay, if that's all, I'll just get back to me--
Squidward: Fluff it.
Mr. Krabs: [angered] What did you say?
Squidward: I said, "fluff it."
Mr. Krabs: [mocking tone] Fluff my pillow, I'll fluff your pillow. [Krabs angrily fluffs the pillow for Squidward]
Squidward: [angered] What's that?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, uh, I said, uh, will there be anything else, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: [relaxes on his pillow] No thanks. That should do it. [Krabs walks away] Oh, Krabsy!
Mr. Krabs: [irritated tone] What can I do for you?
Squidward: Just one more thing. I'm afraid you'll have to take over for me today.
Mr. Krabs: What!? No!
Squidward: Oh, that's too bad. It looks like my twisted ankle might become a 'permanent injury.'
Mr. Krabs: [cringes] Well, that would be an even bigger fine. You just sit back down and relax. We don't want you being injured any further. [chuckles nervously, then walks away] That was close. Well, at least the Krusty Krab isn't very busy today. [anchovies meep] Of course. [cuts to scene where SpongeBob holds a clipboard.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I have the OWS accident report form to fill out. Let's see, Question 1: Was the accident the result of criminal negligence? [Mr. Krabs screams] Mr. Krabs, what is criminal negligence?
Mr. Krabs: [takes the clipboard from SpongeBob] It's what criminals wear to bed. Don't worry about that. We don't need to bother those nice folks over at the OWS. We can do our own investigation. 
SpongeBob: Oh, you mean we should find out if you're criminally negligent.
Mr. Krabs: Well, no, not exactly, what I mean is... [leans towards SpongeBob and whispers] I think Mr. Squidward is hiding something, and I want you to investigate.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Shhhh. [whispering] You gotta keep it a secret from Squidward.
SpongeBob: Can do, Mr. Krabs.
[Cuts to scene where SpongeBob tries to figure out the cause of the accident]
SpongeBob: Hmm? Huh? If I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, I'm gonna need some help. [Cuts to scene where Patrick is shown] Okay, you stand here... [places Patrick next to the shelf, then places a few buns on top] Now, pretend you're Squidward and reach for a bun. [Patrick does so] And I'll simulate the shelf hitting Squidward. [slams the shelf into Patrick, who screams and stumbles around, dizzy, before falling over] Hmm, we seem to be missing something. Well, we'll have to do it again.
Patrick: Uhh, do what again? [cut to outside of the scene] Ow!
SpongeBob: Darn, one more time.
Patrick: Ow! [cuts to scene where Squidward relaxes on Krusty Krab roof. Mr. Krabs comes to the roof with a tea kit in his hand]
Squidward: Oh, Krabsy, after tea, I think a full tentacle massage would be an order.
Mr. Krabs: I ain't touching your tentacles with a 10-ft...
Squidward: [on phone] Hello, Office Workers Safety Department....[Mr. Krabs jumps at Squidward ripping the phone out of his hand, then eats it.]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles nervously] I'll go get the massage oil now. [runs inside; cut to the storage room] Boy, ya got anything?
SpongeBob: Not yet, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs  groans; takes a bucket of fry grease]
Squidward: [clearing throat] I'm waiting!
Mr. Krabs: Coming!
SpongeBob: This just isn't adding up.
Patrick: [sits up] Pudding?
SpongeBob: We must be missing something. Patrick, we're going to need help even more expert than you. [cut to inside the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs massages Squidward's tentacles using the fry grease]
Frankie Billy:  Um, hello? Anybody here?
Mr. Krabs: [angered, muttering] Oh, for the love of peat moss.
Frankie Billy: Anybody at all? Hmm, maybe they're on their lunch bre-- [Mr. Krabs reaches into Frankie Billy's pocket, pulling out the money, walks into the kitchen to prepare a Krabby Patty, then comes out to present a Patty covered in fry grease]
Frankie Billy: Um, aren't you gonna wash your...... [Mr. Krabs shoves the greasy Krabby Patty into Frankie Billy's mouth; Frankie Billy groans in pain as he holds his stomach. Krabs returns to pampering Squidward by continuing to massage his tentacles]
Mr. Krabs: How long do I have to keep this up?
Squidward: Oh, it's gonna be a long, slow recovery. Time to pop my back barnacles. [Mr. Krabs screams as Squidward's back barnacles are shown and then he cries. The customers mutter in anger]
OWS Manager: Office Workers Safety Department. I'm here to investigate the accident.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, no!
Squidward: [sitting up] Oh, yes!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, after all I've done for you, you've called the OWS?!
SpongeBob: He didn't call them, Mr. Krabs, we did. I needed help investigating the accident. Right, buddy?
Patrick: Uh, breakfast, green, Finland. 
Squidward: Well I, for one, plan to give him my full cooperation. [seen in a wheelchair with casts around his head, his arm, and one of his legs] Anything I can do, inspector? [smiles at Mr. Krabs, who fumes with anger; cuts to scene where they all investigate the accident]
OWS Manager: So, this is where the accident occurred. Can anyone tell me what happened?
Squidward: I'll be glad to... [in despair] I mean, I can re-live the whole tragic episode, if I must. [struggles to get up from the wheelchair] It was just another day at the Krusty Krab. I was at the register, giving it a nice shining between orders, when something caught my eye; a patty bun with 10 seeds, instead of 11. I wasn't about to stand idly by and allow a customer go without all his guaranteed nutrients and vitamins. "I must replace it with a proper bun!", I said. I dashed into action.
Squidward: Excuse me, sir.
Frankie Billy: What a diligent and charming individual.
Squidward: That's when I entered the back room to grab a new bun. Just as I was about to reach for one, I heard a slight creek, and that's when the chain snapped, and then, slam! My heroic and brave actions were halted by an unsafe shelf. Disoriented and in pain, I collapsed, and lay for nearly six hours crying softly for help. [crying] Help! H-help! Help.  The worst part, though, is...is that I didn't get that kind gentleman his new bun.
OWS Manager: Hmmm, I see. As you know, certain penalties are involved...
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no...
OWS Manager: [types in random numbers while Mr. Krabs cries] One... Dollar.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps, blinking, wild sobbing, train bell dings] No! Why?! Why, why?! Huh? [scene zooms out to reveal a surveillance camera] What's this? Hold on a second. Me video surveillance camera!
Squidward: [shocked] What?!
Mr. Krabs: I forgot. I, uh, um, borrowed that from the airport. Now, let's see what really happened here. [Mr. Krabs comes back with the recording tape and the TV from the surveillance. Squidward is seen walking towards the bun shelf, but what he does is sleep on it. The chain immediately breaks and Squidward falls unharmed under the buns. Mr. Krabs gasps, then turns to Squidward furiously.] You... f-f-f-f-f-faker! Not to mention you were sleeping on the job! [sighs deeply, forcing Squidward to the ground]
Squidward: What are you going to do to me?
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna make you pay.
Squidward: Oh, no! [cuts to scene where Krabs gets pampered. Krabs sighs. Squidward gasps. When Squidward starts to pop some of the barnacles on Mr. Krabs back, he screams in sorrow.]


[The camera zooms in to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [sees Mr. Krabs doing something] Mr. Krabs, what 'cha doin'?
Mr. Krabs: Oh ahoy, SpongeBob! I was just using some old toothpaste I found to patch up this small hole in the wall.
Squidward: [interrupts] Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that.
Mr. Krabs: And why is that, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Because then you'd only get to repair it once.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs both blink]
SpongeBob: So, what flavor is it?
Mr. Krabs: It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy. It doesn't have a flavor.
SpongeBob: No, I mean the toothpaste!
Mr. Krabs: Oh. Well I think it's... [Mr. Krabs notices the toothpaste drip, the wall cracks, and falls down]
SpongeBob: Hey, look Mr. Krabs! That small hole in the wall just became a medium-sized hole in the wall!
Squidward: Time to get out the dental floss. Ha! [cuts to a man and two boys riding in a boat, going to the Krusty Krab]
Boy 1: Thanks again for taking us to the Krusty Krab, dad.
Boy 2: Yeah. Mom never brings us here!
Frank: Ha. Any time kids. [notices the hole in the wall] What the?
[Mr. Krabs tries to put more toothpaste on]
SpongeBob: Careful now...
Frank: Hey, you guys put in a drive thru!
Mr. Krabs: [confused] We did?
Frank: Great, I'll have three large Krabby Patties, Krabby Fries, a Krabby Cola, and two extra large orders of Krabby Rings. [Notices the toothpaste on his hands and sniffs them] Is this toothpaste?
Mr. Krabs: [smirking] Boy, I don't know how I think think of this stuff, but I think I got a winner! We are putting in a drive thru!
SpongeBob: [amazed] A drive--- whoa!
Squidward: Sounds like a lot of extra work to me.
Mr. Krabs: You mean for you.
Squidward: [pounds the cash register] It'll cost you money.
Mr. Krabs: Oh nonsense, we'll build it for free!
[Cuts to Mr. Krabs outside looking through the hole]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob. What's with all the booty?
SpongeBob: I got this microphone system so we can hear what the customers order, this neat sign with a menu on it, and this colorful arrow so they know where to go. It even lights up, see? [Light turns on and Mr. Krabs is blinded, slightly unfazed]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's great SpongeBob, but I already got a bunch of stuff that's better: A menu board made with old napkins and packing tape, a microphone I made with some rusty tin cans I found, and this sign... I made from an old noodle.
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. How is this stuff better than the things I bought?
Mr. Krabs: [puts the first microphone cup up to SpongeBob's mouth as Mr. Krabs' ear is on the receiving end] I'm sorry, what?
SpongeBob: [shouts into the microphone cup] How is this stuff better?
Mr. Krabs: Because it was... [shakes the microphone to get a better signal] Free! [blows SpongeBob away with his loud voice]
[Bubble transition]
Frankie Billy: [pulls up to the drive thru in his boat] I'll have a medium fries, a large Krabby Patty, [takes the end of the menu for a closer look] and a medium drink.
Squidward: Comin' right up, sir. [walks to his workstation boat and places a note with an order on the kitchen window] SpongeBob, I need a medium fries, a large Krabby Patty, and a medium drink.
SpongeBob: I'll have that ready in two shakes in a lamprey's tail! [Laughs and then tries to deliver the order through the small hole in the hall, but struggles until accidentally dropping all the contents of the tray onto the ground outside. Makes an apologetic face as the customer is unsatisfied before coming up with a solution. He then comes outside and places a small trampoline next to the order hole while humming] That oughta' fix it! [Back inside the Krusty Krab, he dumps the order on the trampoline and it jumps and splatters the customer, who is visibly disappointed] Thank you, come again.
[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' office]
Mr. Krabs: [playing with his money and talking to it in a baby-tease voice] Yes, you like it here, don't you? [Billy walks in] Can I help you? [Billy gives Mr. Krabs a bill] A bill?! What's this for?
Frankie Billy: It's for my dry cleaning. It seems as though your new drive-through window is a little on the challenge side. [grease drips off of him] Size-wise, I mean.
Mr. Krabs: [Crashes the drive-through window with a mallet, increasing the size of the hole] There, problem solved! [Folds his arms smiling as Billy narrows his eyes]
French Narrator: [reads the time card] Meanwhile...
Squidward: [places an order on the note rack] SpongeBob, two large, two medium. I hate my job.
Dale: [at the drive thru window] Excuse me? I'd like to place an order please. [Squidward walks up there before he is interrupted by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, Squidward.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I am getting really tired of running back and forth. I find it both exhausting and time consuming.
Mr. Krabs: [Pushes the cash register boat beside the hole in the wall, then pushes the grill along with SpongeBob into his office, and finally pushes his chair into the kitchen. Then walks back to Squidward]
Squidward: [Sarcastically] Oh, wonderful. Peachy... Now how am I supposed to get to SpongeBob so I can hand him these order tickets here?
Mr. Krabs: [Smashes a hole to his office wall revealing SpongeBob; stars on a black screen are shown to emphasize the damage] Problem solved!
SpongeBob: Squidward! Hi!
Squidward: Oh it's days like this that make me wish I had gone to college.
Plankton: [Drives up in a small car] Now I'll be able to get a Krabby Patty the simplest way possible: [stops his car] By ordering one! [Laughs evilly] Ahem! I would like to order one Krabby Patty please! Uh, extra secret formula! [pauses] Hello?! Is this stupid thing on?!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! Any customers?
Squidward: None that I can hear.
Mr. Krabs: [Looks out the hole] Oh! Here comes one now!
Plankton: [notices the customer entering the drive thru] Hey. Hey! Go around! Go around! [Gets run over and squished; he screams]
Old man: Large Krabby Patty with fries please.
Squidward: [writes down his order in a notepad and responds via the tin can microphone] With fries. Got it. We'll have that right out to you sir.
Old Man: What? You're closed?! Now she tells me... [Drives off in anger]
Squidward: [Comes back with a bag] There you are sir. The ketchup's in the b-- [realizes there's no one there] What? Did somebody order a Krabby Patty? [Plankton slowly raises up his arm] Nobody, huh? Okay, I'll just toss it in the trash. [Walks away to do so off-screen. Plankton's arm goes down]
French Narrator: [reads time card] Later...
Pearl: [She and her friends enter the drive thru in their boat; they laugh] I sure am in a jovial mood! How about you guys? [Laughs again]
Girl 1: You bet, Pearl!
Girl 2: Oh, I'm feeling especially jovial. You know, being a teenager and all!
Squidward: [speaking through the microphone tin cans off-screen] Welcome to the Krusty Krab drive thru. Can I take your order?
Pearl: Hey, you guys. It sounds like that weird guy Squidward. What do you say we play a prank on him?
Girl 2: Ooh! Sounds like a great idea to me! Being a teenager and all! [Takes out a megaphone] Two large Krabby Patties, please! [Pause] With fries! [Giggles]
Squidward: [His left ear is shown pounding due to the pain inflicted; he is shown sweating. He holds his ear as he cries a bit] Owwwww! I'm not faking it you know. That really hurt. A lot.
[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs and Squidward in the kitchen; Mr. Krabs is shown sitting at his office desk; Squidward's ear is now bandaged]
Mr. Krabs: [holding a bill from Squidward] A bill?! And what is this for?
Squidward: [points to his bandaged ear] It's for my ear-replacement surgery! We need a real microphone and speaker!
Mr. Krabs: You have any idea how much a real microphone and speaker cost?!
Squidward: How much?
Mr. Krabs: Well... they cost as much as... as uh... as a... real microphone and... speaker.
French Narrator: [reads time card] Just then.
Larry: [drives his large S.U.B. into the tin can, breaking it in the process] Whoa, whoa. Woopsie!
Mr. Krabs: [Notices the tin can falling off] Hey! You delinquent! [goes back inside]
Squidward: Now you'll have to replace it.
Mr. Krabs: Replace what?
Squidward: The microphone!
Mr. Krabs: What do I look like, I'm made out of tin cans?
Squidward: No, but that pile of tin cans over there is. [Points to a pile of tin cans]
Mr. Krabs: Good thing we got you around to always point out the obvious.
Squidward: Good thing you're around to never notice the obvious!
Larry: [Watches Mr. Krabs fix the microphone] Sorry about that, dude.
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's nice! [Walks away but then comes back briefly to warn him] I'm still billing you for the damages!
SpongeBob: [Walks to the hole holding a Krabby Patty meal] One Krabby Meal! To go!
Larry: Hand it on up here!
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Larry! [Tries to hand the Krabby Meal up to Larry but struggles accompanied with grunts]
Larry: Come on, bro! You can do it! [SpongeBob continues to struggle until he falls out the hole and onto the ground, dropping the meal in the process, which splatters onto himself] Or maybe not.
SpongeBob: [Walks to Mr. Krabs while he is covered in food] Mr. Krabs, I'm concerned.
Mr. Krabs: Oh? Why, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Because I can't reach the window of Larry the Lobster's S.U.B.!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah... Well there's a solution to every problem! [Smashes another hole above the first one, revealing Larry's face] There! Problem solved! [Laughs. Hears honking noises] Hey! What's all the ruckourous about!? Whoa... [notices the long line of cars outside]
Millie: Hey! What's the hold up?!
Man 1: How long you gonna make us wait?!
Man 2: We're waiting here for hours!
Harold: We're still waiting... in our driveway!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! There's a line of customers out there a million miles long!
Squidward: [Sarcastically] That's nice. [shifts his attention to a red book he is reading] That's interesting.
Mr. Krabs: I guess I'll be retiring early after all! [Walks and laughs and then spots a policeman in the middle of where the boat register used to be]
Policeman: Mr. Eugene Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Yes? [The policeman hands him a ticket] What? Is this a-a-a ticket?!
Policeman: A ticket? [Laughs] Now why would I write you a ticket? Huh? Oh, I know! How about for turning the whole town into a parking lot?!
Mr. Krabs: Ah! But officer! I a... I a... Listen!
Policeman: Relax man, that's just my order. I want two Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go! [shows his badge] I don't wait in lines!
Mr. Krabs: Oh sure! Right! Phew! [Laughs] SpongeBob, can you get the kind officer two-
SpongeBob: [Appears with the bag of Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries] -Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go, sir? Anything for our boys in blue!
Mr. Krabs: [hands him the bag] There you go, officer! And thanks for being so understanding! If you know what I mean? No charge.
Policeman: [takes the bag] You're welcome. Just hope the mayor doesn't find out about this mess. He's the one you need to worry about! [Holds open the door letting the Mayor in] Mayor. [Leaves]
Mayor: Eugene Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [screams] Mr. Mayor!
Mayor: The whole town is in a stand-still because your drive thru is so slow!
Mr. Krabs: Well... don't you worry, Mr. Mayor! There's an answer for that, too! [Smashes another hole on the other side of the Krusty Krab] There you go! See, now we got two drive thrus, two lines, and I'll make money twice as fast! [Laughs]
Mayor: Hmm! That should work perfectly!
[Bubble transition to a bunch of boatmobiles surrounding the outside of the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob trying to deliver the numerous orders]
SpongeBob: Okay! Who had the Double Krabby Patty with fries and extra chee-? [The crowd angrily yells and tries to grab the food]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Order up!
SpongeBob: I'm on it! [Dashes over, takes the order ticket, and then starts grilling many Krabby Patties at the same time]
Squidward: Hurry, SpongeBob! I got 26 more orders!
SpongeBob: [Grows a bunch of arms, flips the patties, and comes out carrying a bunch of trays with orders on them] 26 orders up!
Squidward: [Running past SpongeBob] No, no, no! Not that window! The other one!
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you sure?! These customers over here look really, really hungry! [Spots a bunch of people in the window yelling]
Squidward: [Customers are biting on him] And these ones don't?!
Lenny: [Honks and suddenly gets hit from behind] Hey, hey, hey, watch it, will ya?! I just had this thing repainted!
Frank (lifeguard): And I just had this repainted! [Takes out a pipe-like object]
Lenny: [Scared] I see you used the extra-glossy...
Plankton: [Walking around holding chum] Chum nuggets here! Going fast! Get 'em while they're cold! Get 'em while they're runny! Looks like Krabs' drive thru is really paying off... [takes out some cash] for me! [Laughs evilly. Then spots something] Oh no... not again. [screams and gets run over by the same old man from earlier]
Old Man: Oh darn it! Now there's a line!
Plankton: [Gets up] Watch where you're going, old man! This is the second time!
Old Man: I'm too old to wait in lines! [Squashes Plankton a third time by backing up to leave]
Plankton: [takes out a chum nugget] Chum Nuggets... get 'em before [His arm breaks and the chum he is holding lands in his eye] my arm falls off...
Mr. Krabs: [gasps as he notices the enormous line of customers outside] They're everywhere!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Stay back! Take Squidward, not me! [Opens eyes and spots Squidward] Oh, hi Squidward.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! We gotta do something! The customers are mad with hunger! They're beginning to riot!
Squidward: For once, he's right!
Mr. Krabs: Easy, boys! Easy! Don't you think you're both getting a little carried away? I mean, I hardly call this a riot! Right? [Laughs] Like- [The Krusty Krab sign suddenly crashes through the window] Oh... kay... Don't worry! [takes out a sledgehammer] I can solve this! [runs over to the wall] More drive thrus! More money!
[Mr. Krabs smashes another hole in the Krusty Krab causing it to suddenly crack. All of the customers drive away screaming]
Mr. Krabs: [hears the cracking noise as the Krusty Krab begins to disintegrate] Hey? Is somebody eating potato chips?
[The Krusty Krab finally breaks apart, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob emerge from the rubble]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs! [Takes out the tube of toothpaste from earlier] We can fix it! [Squirts the rubble with the toothpaste, until the tube runs out] We might need to buy some more toothpaste though. [Mr. Krabs cries, ending the episode]


[the episode begins with SpongeBob coming into Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
SpongeBob: [Singing and running] ♪Going on down to Boating School! Boating School! Boating School! Going on down to Boating School! Rea de de la Mrs. Puff!♪ [Stops and notices a crowd cheering] For me? Well on behalf on yours truly, I would like to thank each of you for such a wonderful and warm welcome. [Walks over and shakes a female fish's fin] Thank you. [Walks over to Sandals and shakes his fin] Thank you sir.
Sandals: What I do?
SpongeBob: [bumps into Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff, thank you most of all! [about to kiss Mrs. Puff's fin, but she pulls it away]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, that warm welcome wasn't for you.
SpongeBob: It wasn't?
Mrs. Puff: No!
SpongeBob: Then, who was it for?
Shubie: It's for him!
[The crowd cheers as a green raceboat with the number 1 pulls up in front of the Driving School. A pit crew quickly changes its tires and smokes from the engines fog up then clear up revealing a fish with sunglasses, a hat, and a mustache]
SpongeBob: [gasps] It's Tony Fast! The famous race boat driver! [camera points down to a smaller fish beside Tony Fast] And his first born son, Tony Fast Jr.!
Mable-Monica: I can't believe it's him! Oh... [Falls onto a random fish's arms]
SpongeBob: I can't believe that I'm in the presence of such big celebrities.
Tony Fast: [Pats Tony Jr.'s shoulder] Good luck on your first day of school son!
Tony Jr.: Yeah, whatever.
Tony Fast: Don't show off too much! [chuckles] Show off and just enough!
[Tony Fast drives away on his raceboat causing smoke to fill the air to which the crowd coughs but then cheers and gathers around Tony Jr.]
Harold: Hey! Tony Jr., [Takes out a lunch box] wanna sign my lunch box?
Sandles: [Takes out a steering wheel] You wanna sign my steering wheel?
Shubie: Wanna sign my...
Harold: Hey! I was here first!
Shubie: No you weren't! I was!
Mrs. Puff: [Blows on whistle panting and sweating and taking a deep breath, then coughs] Ahem! While Tony Jr. is a student here, he will receive no special attention! He will be treated just like the rest of us! No exceptions! Now Tony, report to the obstacle course where I will access your abilties!
Tony Jr: Sure thing Teach! [Walks over]
Mrs. Puff: Hold it! [Takes out a lunch box] Not until you've signed my lunchbox! [Laughs]
Crowd: [cuts to next scene] Go, Tony Jr., Go! Go, Tony Jr., GO! [Tony Jr. drives by them] Yay!
Tony Jr.: [driving] Looks like it's my turn! [Turns though a zig-zag like road] What goes around comes around! [Drives around a giant anchor] Over and out! [Drives up a hill-like road then back down and to the finish]
Crowd: Hooray!
Mrs. Puff: [thinking] He is good... Gasp! If he's really that good, maybe there's a chance, just a chance, some of that good could rub off my incorrigible student SpongeBob SquarePants! [Chuckles and out of thoughts] Yes!
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: Yes SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: What does "Incorrigible" mean?
[cuts to Tony Jr. in the boat with SpongeBob]
Tony Jr.: So you just want me to ride around with this dude for awhile?
Mrs. Puff: That's it.
Tony Jr.: Whatever... Let's roll!
SpongeBob: It's nice to finally meet you Tony Fast Jr! [Pants happily]
Tony Jr.: I said let's roll!
SpongeBob: [Sweating frantically] Okay! Uh, roll? Roll!? Roll!? Is there a button for that? [Starts pushing random button on the front of the boat] I know I know this! It's around here somewhere! I-
Tony Jr.: Just drive!
SpongeBob: Just driving! [Slams down on the gas pedal driving quickly in which both SpongeBob and Tony Jr. scream as SpongeBob tries to drive the boat] W-w-w-what do these dotted lines mean?
Tony Jr.: Relax, man. You gotta relax.
SpongeBob: Relax... relax? Mrs. Puff hasn't taught us that yet!
Tony Jr.: No, I mean just relax man...
SpongeBob: Okay... just relaxing... and... relaxing! Relaxing! So hard! [Eye lids shatter] Raw! I cant' relax!
Tony Jr.: No, no, no. Not like that. You just gotta let go.
SpongeBob: Let go?
Tony Jr.: Be... cool...
SpongeBob: Be cool?
Tony Jr.: Be... cool...
SpongeBob: Be... cool... [Softly has foot on the gas pedal as he drives perfectly around the corner and around the anchor] Cool...[Drives up and down the road hill and finishes the course]
Tony Jr.: Not bad, dude, not bad.
Suzy: Gasp! It's a miracle!
Harold: [On knees] Neptune be praised!
Mrs. Puff: That went better than expected! Oh! If Tony Jr. can keep this up, then SpongeBob might even graduate and I'll be rid of him forever! Forever! [Laughs] Forever!
Tony Jr.: Okay Bro-Jangles! Catch you... [Jumps and flips off of the boat landing perfectly on the ground] ...on the flipside! [Snaps and then gets picked up by Mrs. Puff] What the? [Mrs. Puff kisses him on the cheek]
[Cuts back to Tony Jr. walking on the boardwalk]
Tony Jr.: [Stops walking and notices SpongeBob] Yeah, what is it? Can't you see I'm walking here?
SpongeBob: I can see that! And I'm eager to learn more from you!
Tony Jr.: Eager?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Tony Jr.: I can't teach you anything more at this square school, no offense, SquarePants.
SpongeBob: None taken!
Tony Jr.: Well, if you really wanna learn more, you can come by my house laters![Walks off]
SpongeBob: Oh! I'll be delighted to!
[Cuts to SpongeBob outside of the gates of Tony Fast and Tony Jr.'s house]
SpongeBob: [Presses the button on the speaker]
Tony Jr.: Who is it?
SpongeBob: It's SpongeBob SquarePants!
Tony Jr: Who?
SpongeBob: SpongeBob, SquarePants! [The gates open and Tony Jr. appears on a unicycle] Tony Fast Jr.!
Tony Jr.: Guy From School! Come on in!
SpongeBob: [Inside the house] Nice place you got here Tony Jr.!
Tony Jr.: Thanks! Lived here all my life! My mom and dad are out.
SpongeBob: Oh! Uh, what does that mean?
Tony Jr.: It means... you wanna see my dad's vintage speedboat collection?
SpongeBob: Oh would I?
[cuts to Tony Fast's gararge showing many speedboats]
Tony Jr.: And he took first place in this beauty surpassing speed records held by both Francis Baconskin Jr. and Smitty Tailpipe Rockama!
SpongeBob: Wow! They're so shiny!
Tony Jr.: Pick your favorite!
SpongeBob: My favorite? Oh I couldn't!
Tony Jr.: Why sure you can! What's the big-
SpongeBob: [Points to a red speedboat with flames on the front and with the number 8 on it] This one!
Tony Jr.: Huh? The Batonia Classic! Excellent choice! [Grabs the keys to the Batonia Classic] Want to take her for a spin?
SpongeBob: A spin? But we don't even have boating licenses!
Tony Jr.: [In the speedboat] You don't need a boating license for a raceboat SquarePants!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob driving the Batonia Classic]
SpongeBob: Wow Tony Jr.! She handles like a dream! It's like I'm floating air!
Tony Jr.: [On a hanglider flying as a rope is keeping him tied to the speedboat] You're telling me!
SpongeBob: Are you sure you're comfortable with me driving, though? I admit I'm feeling a little nervous...
Tony Jr.: I wouldn't if I were you! Remember it was your nerves that made us almost crash before!
SpongeBob: Hah... my nerves! I almost forgot about... my nerves! [Starts driving nervously almost running over a fish] Sorry sir!
Tony Jr.: Just let go! [lets go of the hanglider but grabs back onto it] Phew...
SpongeBob: Let go... got it! [Lets go of the steering wheel and drives around a curve] Whee!
Tony Jr.: Go faster, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Faster?
Tony Jr.: Just let go! Of the brakes!
SpongeBob: Eh... if you say so! [Sticks up  his foot higher letting go of the brake and going even faster around more curves] Whee! [Goes down the street] Whee! [Goes over a loop] Whee!
Tony Jr: Now you're getting it!
SpongeBob: Whee... red light! [Notices the light turn red]
Tony Jr: Ah!
SpongeBob: [Instantly stops the boat]
Tony Jr: Real cool SquarePants... [Now beside SpongeBob in the boat]
SpongeBob: Thanks TFJ...[Notices three fish in another speedboat beside them]
Street Racer: That's quite a fancy speed boat you got right there! For a couple of squares!
Female Passenger: What he said! [All three laugh]
SpongeBob: Thank you! And may I say how lovely your speed boat is, too! For a bunch of circles! And by circles, I mean well-rounded individuals! Ah ha ha ha!
Street Racer: Well wise guy eh? Well then, how about you wise up to an unfriendly competition? Right here, right now!
Female Passenger: Yeah! What he said!
SpongeBob: Right here, right now? A little short notice... [Takes out a small book] let me check my availability. [Looks in the book] Let's see... Right now... Looks like I don't have anything scheduled for right now. Therefore, I would like to accept your challenge!
Tony Jr: Yes!
SpongeBob: However! Certain safety concerns prevent me from doing so! Therefore, I must decline!
Tony Jr: SquarePants! I can't believe what I'm hearing here!
SpongeBob: [Tries to listen for something] I don't hear anything...
Tony Jr: [Face-palm] Ah... Look kid! Being cool includes accepting this challenge! Anything less would be an embarrassment!
SpongeBob: I would never want to embarrass you Tony Jr. Therefore, I accept your challenge!
Street Racer: Oh it's on!
Female Passenger: What he said!
Street Racer: Do you mind?
[Both racers get ready as the red light changes to green and they both take off through the town. They pass fish in which they rip their clothes off and onto another. SpongeBob starts to get the lead.]
Street Racer: Huh? [Speeds up passed SpongeBob and Tony Jr]Hah hah!
Female Passenger: What he said!
SpongeBob: Grr... Grr! [Presses down harder on the gas pedal which starts to catch in flames as he speeds passed Larry the Lobster burning him]
Larry: Sweet! Instant tannage!
[SpongeBob catches up to the Male Race Driver as they continue to drive beside each other]
SpongeBob: [Growls] Grr!
Street Racer: [Laughs until the Female Passenger points out to him, his eyes go through his glasses as there is a sign saying "Click It or Ticket" with police near by. He goes quick, and then slows down]
SpongeBob: We're winning! We're winning!
[SpongeBob and Tony Jr. laugh as they speed passed the police car]
Policeman 1: Whoa! Did you see that?
Policeman 2: That guy wasn't just going fast...
Both: ...He was going Tony Fast!
SpongeBob: [Notices the police car] Huh? Oh no! The cops are after us! What are we going to do?
Tony Jr: What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you over that siren.
[A police helicopter now follows them]
SpongeBob: Now there's a helicopter after us!
Tony Jr: What's that? I couldn't hear you over that helicopter!
[Tony Fast is in his speedboat listening to the news on his radio]
Newsman: And in other news, son of racing legend, Tony Fast is currently involved in a high speed chase, it is rumored that the...
[SpongeBob and Tony Jr. drive passed Tony Fast with the police car and police helicopter still following them]
Tony Fast: What the?
SpongeBob: What're we going to do!? [notices Tony Fast in the mirror chasing them]
Tony Fast: Tony Jr! When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna-
SpongeBob: Now your dad is after us!
Tony Jr: Sorry I couldn't hear you, my... my... My dad is after us! What're we gonna do?!
SpongeBob: How should I know? He's your dad!
Tony Jr: Well just remember my advice, okay? All you got to do is let go... be cool... let go... be cool...
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Do you see where letting go has gotten us so far? Huh, Tony Jr? [pants heavily]
Tony Jr: No, but I see where it's getting us next!
SpongeBob: [notices quickly] [screams] [drives through the sign of Mrs. Puff's Boating School and ends up on Mrs. Puff as she inflates]
[Cuts to the inside of the classroom]
Mrs. Puff: Well class, I regret to inform you that Tony Jr. is no longer with us...
Crowd: Gasp!
Mrs. Puff: He was transferred to another school. However, I would think that Tony Jr. taught us all a valuable lesson...
SpongeBob: [On a hospital bed] Oh! Oh! Oh! Never argue and drive?
Mrs. Puff: Close... the lesson is: Never let you drive!

 
[SpongeBob's alarm rings, his house blows toward Squidward's house, Squidward wakes up in dread, sand hands then cover the house's ears, then SpongeBob, in brown plaid, poses for one second then runs to Patrick's house.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Tee time, Patrick! Patrick! [cuts to Squidward] Tee time, Patrick! [cuts to Patrick's house] Patrick! Wake up!
Patrick: [laughs] Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course. [There is a rumbling sound then storm clouds move in and start rain and thunder]
SpongeBob: Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged. [twist putter]
Patrick: Dumb rain! Doesn't anybody know I'm the sheriff in these parts? [points to sky with putter] Hey, rain! You better stop that! [Patrick gets shocked by lightning then screams. Cuts to Squidward grumbling &amp; covers head with blanket]
Patrick: [continues screaming then gets burned to ashes] AAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Squidward: [opens window] If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sorry, Squidward.
SpongeBob: I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how...
Squidward: Don't care. [closes window, cuts to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. Thanks a lot, rain! [slams fist onto table and makes golf ball ricochet off of door then Gary into Gary's food bowl] Hey, [raises finger]  that gives me an idea. [card comes up saying: BRIEF CONSTRUCTION MONTAGE]
French narrator: What follows is a brief construction montage.
[Shows SpongeBob and Patrick hammering on boards, ripping a sofa, pouring sand, drilling holes, filling holes with water, making holes, and taking Gary's shell off. cuts back to card.]
French narrator: We hope you enjoyed this brief construction montage.
[cuts to outside of house, with sounds and SpongeBob's house shaking. Cuts to inside of Squidward's house.]
Squidward: [grumbles then gets so angry his sleep mask burns off, puts three pillows on a desk, ties them to his face with a rope, still hears them, then rips pillows off and screams. He walks to SpongeBob's house with umbrella, cuts to inside, where SpongeBob and Patrick are constructing] Hey! Hello?! Nitwit, morons. [Patrick hits Squidward with a hammer, Squidward screams]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward. Up from your slumber, I see. Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of [shows course] indoor miniature golf!
Squidward: I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two! Presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap!
Patrick: But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five. [cuts to sculpture]
Squidward: I don't care! Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna...
Patrick: Join us on the back nine?
Squidward: Just don't let it happen again! Or else. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Let's get this game teed off. [balls come out of his head, he catches them, places a ball and tee on grass] You're up first, my good man.
[Patrick stretches, yawns, stomps, ululates.]
Squidward: Would you two KEEP IT DOWN?!
SpongeBob: Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick. Don't want to upset Squidward.
Patrick: Can't wait to lose, huh? [aims, pulls back, and shoots. Ball ricochets back to tee] NO! Ooh. If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot!
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it. [places ball on tee] Besides, we're just playin' for fun, right? And back, and- [makes it]
Patrick: Nice shot. [moves ball]
SpongeBob: What are you doing?
Patrick: Moving my ball.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you have to play it where it lands.
Patrick: Fine. Have it your way. [moves ball back to original place, shoots, makes it] Ready to give up?
[cuts to a hole]
Patrick: Ha! Let's see how you do against the windmill. You haven't got a chance.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, this is just a game.
Patrick: Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win.
SpongeBob: I think you're missing the point. [aims, practice shots]
Patrick: Speaking of m-m-MISSING! [SpongeBob shoots by accident, startled by Patrick] Ha! Gotta play it where it lands. Watch and learn, SquarePants. Watch and learn. [shoots and makes it] YES! See if you can top that!
SpongeBob: [uneasily] Okay.
Patrick: [with microphone and headphones] SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey. [SpongeBob swings but stops] A pressure-packed shot to be sure. [leaves]
[SpongeBob sweats and wipes his forehead and shoots, and the ball stops right before it's about to go in.]
Bikini Bottomites: Aw. [all whisper]
[cuts to hole]
Patrick: Looks like we're tied, three shots to three.
SpongeBob: Shots. [chuckles] They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots.
Patrick: Whatever. [shoots and makes it] AND HE SINKS ANOTHER HOLE IN ONE! That's two in a row!
SpongeBob: All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe. [shoots and makes it] Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now.
Patrick: Watch out for the water hazard.
SpongeBob: Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot.
Patrick: I have no idea what you're talking about.
SpongeBob: Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you. [shoots ball an ball ricochets off of a picture, through a sculpture and out the window] Oops.
Patrick: Show-off. I can do that. [shoots, SpongeBob ducks and goes out the window]
SpongeBob: Oh, where did our balls go?!
Patrick: Well, how do I know? I was just copying you.
SpongeBob: [shows side of Squidward's house and broken window] Uh-oh. Oh well, I guess that's game point.
Patrick: Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet.
SpongeBob: But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise!
Patrick: Who said anything about noise? We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course!
SpongeBob: Hey! Patrick. Patrick! What's the big idea? I thought we were in here to play golf, remember?
Patrick: Okay, okay!
SpongeBob: Now where is that darn ball?
Patrick: Oh!
SpongeBob: Patrick, have you seen my ball?
Patrick: Was it a red one?
SpongeBob: M-hmm.
Patrick: It might have been in the kelp salad.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you ate my ball?
Patrick: Don't worry, I'll get it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, no.
Patrick: No?
SpongeBob: I have to play the ball where it lies. [goes inside Patrick and opens his mouth] You'll need to leave this open. [goes back inside] Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore! [the ball goes through wall and hits lamp] Where's your ball?
Patrick: I don't know. Got to be around here somewhere. [ball is seen on Patrick's butt on the outside of his pants]
SpongeBob: There it is!
Patrick: Uh-oh.
SpongeBob: Play it where it lies.
Patrick: [angrily grumbling. Cuts to him shooting it and ricocheting off a cabinet to a overhead desk lamp, picture, and through a wall] Hole in one! Top that!
SpongeBob: I could do that blindfolded. [Patrick hands him a blindfold]
[cuts to blind SpongeBob. He hits a door. Feels around to identify it and slams the door.]
Patrick: Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot!
SpongeBob: [slams a door] Aha!
Patrick: Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot! [SpongeBob splits a table] Wait, My mistake. You're right. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! SpongeBob, red hot! [kills a plant] Wrong again.
SpongeBob: Patrick... [peeks out]
Patrick: Stop peeking! Hotter. [wrecks Squidward's house along the way] Hotter! Hot! Hot! Cold. Hot. Cold. Hot! Cold.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is ridic- [sees Squidward's wrecked house] -ulous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick...!
Patrick: [in shower] AAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!
SpongeBob: What are you doing?
Patrick: I was just freshening up. But these fancy fixtures are touchy [steam builds up around Patrick] Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold! Cold! [SpongeBob turns off the shower]
SpongeBob: Would you please get back in the game?
Patrick: But I wanted to try his loofah.
SpongeBob: Those balls have got to be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick.
Patrick: Uhh, look a little closer, buddy.
SpongeBob: [uneasily] Play it where it lies?
Patrick: Play it where it lies.
SpongeBob: But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?
Patrick: All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse.
SpongeBob: Okay, you're good to go.
Patrick: Fore! [wrecks top front of house] It's all yours.
SpongeBob: This one's for all the marbles.
Patrick: But I thought we weren't betting.
SpongeBob: No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game. [Squidward wakes up and takes off his blindfold to see SpongeBob and Patrick talking]
Squidward: [muffled] What's going on here? [screams]
[SpongeBob and Patrick shoot, landing Gary's food bowl, spilling on him.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hole in one! [Squidward sits up]
SpongeBob: Good morning.
Patrick: Sorry we woke you.
Squidward: [muffled and stammering] Wha-What? [his mouth is shown, with no dentures]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?
[cuts to Gary, with dentures in his bowl.]
Patrick: Good game, pal.
SpongeBob: Rematch next Saturday?
Patrick: Rain or shine, SpongeBob. Rain or shine.
[stops raining, focusing on Squidward's house, which collapses.]
Squidward: [muffled] SpongeBob?!


Narrator: The first day of spring in Bikini Bottom. The flowers are blooming, the rainbows are... how you say? Bowing. The jellyfish are buzzing, [flowers grow all over SpongeBob's house, covering it] and it's time for the traditional...
SpongeBob: Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?
Gary: Meow! [Gary meows in pain. SpongeBob is singing while using Gary as a vacuum cleaner to clean up his house]
SpongeBob: Thanks for your help, Gare!
Gary: Meow!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?
Patrick: It's Spring Cleaning Day?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!
[Patrick runs through his pile of junk to get a cotton swab]
Patrick: Found it! Thanks for the reminder, SpongeBob! [Patrick cleans his belly button] See ya again next spring. [notices trash can] Whatcha got in your trash can? Huh!? You're throwing this away!? The wrapper of the gum I gave you yesterday!?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
Patrick: Oh! Some people just don't understand sentimental value. [gasps] You're throwing away Pete!? Y-You can't part with a keepsake! That's why you keep them, for Pete's sake! Hmph! Why, I'm disgusted! It's time you re-evaluate your priorities.
SpongeBob: Hmm. Maybe Patrick is right. All of these things do hold precious memories. [garbage man tries to take junk. SpongeBob gasps] No! [tries to take his junk back] Come on, you! [continues to pull] Gotcha! Welcome home, precious memories. [puts back his junk and saves empty box of Kelpo and toy wrapper] Plastic wrap is neat, huh, Gary?
Gary: Meow! [Gary is on top of old newspaper]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab] Order up! Careful with these ones, Squidward. They're special.
Squidward: Oh, dear me. I know. I hope I never forget this moment.
SpongeBob: You're right. I'm going to need something to preserve the memory.
SpongeBob: Oh, perfect! [SpongeBob keeps the Krabby Patties grease] Ah, memories. Greasy memories.
SpongeBob: Whoo-wee! Nothing like a hard day of work at the Krusty Krab, eh, Squidward? Whew!
[SpongeBob saves his work sweat]
Squidward: You're sentimental about your sweat?
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not all! And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories! Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward. See? This one has your tentacle print on it!
Squidward: Okay, this is getting creepy now.
SpongeBob: Oh, well, better get these precious memories home.
Squidward: Officially creeped out now.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob singing]♪Memories, doo doo doo memories, doo doo doo doo memories.♪ [opens his door while all of his junk is there] Hey, Gary. [Gary is on top of more old newspaper trying to eat his food. SpongeBob going up the stairs with junk in his wagon] Oh. Safe and sound! [SpongeBob's junk almost falls down, but SpongeBob closes the door before it falls down] Whoo, closed up tight! And you said it wouldn't fit. [all of SpongeBob's junk falls out]
Gary: Meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything.
[SpongeBob looks outside]
SpongeBob: Like the front yard!
[Squidward is sleeping and wakes up by the clock. Squidward gasps when he sees SpongeBob's junk. Squidward opens his door when all of SpongeBob's junk is in the way. Squidward knocks on SpongeBob's door]
SpongeBob: Who is it? [in a singing voice]
Squidward: It's Squidward.
SpongeBob: How do I know it's you?
Squidward: Open the door, nitwit!
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?
Squidward: You can certainly help... [Squidward looks at SpongeBob] Why are you wearing garbage?
SpongeBob: Thanks for noticing, Squidward, and may I say that's a very becoming dress you're wearing this morning.
Squidward: Dress? It is not a dress, it's a nightshirt. If you don't get rid of this trash, I'm calling the sanitation police.
SpongeBob: Ah, not the sanitation police! You don't understand, these things aren't junk! They're my friends, like this little guy, [SpongeBob crying at a light bulb] Alfred the light bulb. Oh, we had a great time together, Al, reading, paying the bills. Why is it the ones who glow brightest burn out the soonest?! [SpongeBob starts to cry] You will be missed.
Squidward: Touching. Still creepy, but touching. Time to make a phone call. [cops come]
Cop 1: Sanitation police! This is a raid. Step away from the refuse.
Squidward: Thank goodness you're here, officer.
Cop: Is this your filthy home?
Squidward: No, it's not my home! It belongs to that filthy little dirtbag!
SpongeBob: Hi!
Cop 1: Thanks for the information, citizen.
Cop 2: [To Squidward] Hmph, snitch.
Cop 1: Do your duty, Sergeant.
Cop 2: [Puts a sticker that reads "COMDEMNED" on SpongeBob's house]
Cop 1: This residence is now comdemned.
SpongeBob: Condemned? What does that mean?
Cop 1: Condemned means this house is unfit to live in. You'll have to vacate the home immediately.
SpongeBob: Vacate? You mean I have to move?
Cop 1: Anything that is a threat to public health must be condemned. Sergeant.
Cop 2: [Puts a sticker that reads "CONDEMNED" on the trashbag on SpongeBob's head]
Squidward: Thank you again, officers.
SpongeBob: Wait! Please don't condemn my house.
Squidward: Sorry, SpongeBob, the law is the law. We can't just pick and choose which ones we follow.
Cop 1: I'll request a commendation for you.
Squidward: Really?
Cop 1: Right after we condemn your house!
Squidward: My house?!
Cop 1: Yes! It's as filthy as your neighbor's. [Shows Squidward's house from the outside being as dirty as SpongeBob's]
SpongeBob: But isn't there anything we can do?
Cop 1: You can evacuate the premises or throw away your junk.
SpongeBob: Throw them away?
Cop 1: Thank you for the attempt, ma'am.
Squidward: Ma'am? It's a nightshirt! [the cops leave] This is all your fault! You have to get rid of your junk right now!
SpongeBob: I know. [crying] I'm gonna miss them so much! [continues crying]
Squidward: You really miss them?
SpongeBob: No. I'll be strong. [continues crying again]
Squidward: Well, maybe you can take photos of all your junk... uh, friends before you toss them away.
SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Squidward! Then years from now, I can look at the photos, and remember my... remember my precious little babies!
Squidward: Creepy.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward, the latter with his hat on and the former holding it, as the garbage man takes the junk away. He elbows Squidward to get his attention, and then points to his head to remind him to take his hat off.]
Squidward: [mutters under his breath] Oh, good grief. [takes his hat off]
[SpongeBob sniffles as the garbage man takes the last can of junk away and throws it into the truck. SpongeBob walks over to him, holding up some dollar bills.]
SpongeBob: Your pay, my good man. 
[The garbage man takes the money and gets into the truck. SpongeBob sniffs again as the truck begins to drive back to the dump.]
SpongeBob: [fighting back tears] Goodbye, little friends. Have fun at the dump! 
[the garbage truck drives away] 
Squidward: Well, now that you completely ruined my day, once again, I'm going back to bed. 
SpongeBob: Alright, nighty-night. 
Squidward: Idiot. [opens his door full of photos. He sees a picture of Pete] What the...?! SpongeBob, why is my house filled with photos of your dumb junk? 
SpongeBob: Oh, I forgot to tell you, I took so many pictures I ran out of room in my house. [He opens the door too filled with photos and Patrick appears sliding with photos] 
Patrick: Nice dress. 
Squidward: [getting angry] It's a nightshirt!

Robot Plankton: And with the prize money, I'll topple your restaurant empire [He leans in.] once and for all!
[Mr. Krabs leans in.]
Mr. Krabs: Ha! Where fetchin' money's involved, nobody topples me.
[The scene cuts to a PA speaker.]
Announcer: [Over the PA] Contestants, ready your sleds.
[The scene cuts to a wide shot of Perch Perkins.]
Perch Perkins: [While walking up to Squidward] Excuse me, sir. [Fred, who is holding a camera, enters the shot.] How do you think you'll do in the race?
[Squidward grabs the microphone.]
Squidward: Hello out there Bikini Bottom! [It cuts to show a medium close up of Squidward. In the upper left corner there is the word "Live" and towards the bottom of the screen is "Bikini Bottom Sleigh Race". All the words are in red.] I'm glad I can finally talk to my adoring fans on television!
[The scene cuts to Fred on his couch, sleeping. He is covered in popcorn and there is a bowl of it below him. The scene returns to Perch Perkins and Squidward. Perch grabs the microphone.]
Perch Perkins: Best of luck to ya. [While walking off-screen] Oh, excuse me miss...
[The scene cuts to a PA speaker.]
Announcer: [Over the PA] On your marks...
[The scene cuts to show the back of the racers. The real Plankton is sneaking away.]
Plankton: So long suckers.
Announcer: ... get set, [The scene shows a very wide shot of the racers.] go!
[Everyone takes off, except Patrick. The scene cuts to a mid-shot of Patrick.]
Patrick: Come on, wormies! Giddy up! [The scene cuts to a wide shot of the Gooey Worms. It then returns to Patrick] Hmm.
[The scene then cuts to a wide shot of the other racers.  It then cuts to a time card that reads, "Meanwhile, Back In the Lowlands..."]
French Narrator: Meanwhile, back in the lowlands...
[The scene cuts to a wide shot of the Krusty Krab. It then cuts to a close up of the window, which features a "Gone Racin'" sign on it. Inside, Plankton, jumps into the scene.]
Plankton: Alone at last! [The scene shows a close up of the floor below the window. Plankton jumps down while he chuckles.] Now, there's nothing between me and the secret formula!
[Plankton laughs while walking off-screen. The scene cuts back to the race. It then cuts to Mr. Krabs, right in front of Thaddeus.]
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, boys! Get me to the greenbacks!
[It pans to Plankton and Karen.]
Robot Plankton: I think not old man. Turbo boost, Karen! 
[Robot Plankton strikes Karen and laughs. Karen's bottom half is shown. On the rover part, a flap opens and a tail pipe appears. It blasts a large about of fire. It cuts to a wide shot of the racers and Karen and Plankton go flying past the others. It picks up snow, which covers Mr. Krabs.  Mr. Krabs blinks twice.]
Mr. Krabs: [While pushing the snow off himself] No! [He grabs the wheel.] I can't let him win.
Sandy: [As she passes Mr. Krabs in her rocket-shaped sled] Don't worry, he won't. [She pushes a button on a remote.] I will. [Robot worms are shown. It cuts back to Mr. Krabs and Sandy as she passes him.] Yeehaw!
[She passes the other racers.]
Patrick: [As he is running up to SpongeBob, holding his three Gooey Worms] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi Patrick. Where's your sleigh?
Patrick: I dunno.
[Patrick eats the Gooey Worms.]
SpongeBob: Hop in. We'll give you a lift. [Patrick hops in. Gary stops and grumbles. He then strains to continue.] Come on Gary!
[The scene cuts back to the interior of the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: Hehehehe! [hops onto Mr. Krabs' desk and tries to turn safe's handle] Locked?! Ugh. [takes out cutter] Good thing I brought this along. [tries to cut safe, but the cutter slides to the ceiling with Plankton, spins three circles, makes two holes in ceiling, falls off, cuts off Plankton's antennae, and rolls away] I'm gonna need something with more firepower.
[cuts to Sandy]
Sandy: Woo wee! Looks like I lost them! [pushes button, but remote breaks] The remote shorted out! The robots are stuck in high gear! Whoa! [sleigh loses control] Aaaa!
[cuts to Squidward]
Squidward: Those dimwits don't stand a chance against my imported worm. [sleight stops, worm starts to drink tea] Hey! What's the big idea?!
Worm: (speaks in a British Accent) I beg your pardon. It's tea time, anyway. [continues to drink tea]
Squidward: I don't have time for this! [leaves sleigh, and goes by foot] Tea time. Of all the ridiculous concepts!' '[walks onto ice, and slips, the ice cracks, and Squidward falls in, losing his winter clothes, and floats back up in a block of ice, with a shocked face]
[cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick, singing]
Patrick: Whoa! Look at that!
SpongeBob: Squidward! Buddy! [stops] He doesn't look so "hot." We better take him with us.
Patrick: Good idea.
Gary: Meoow... [upset]
[Patrick puts Squidward on the sleigh, SpongeBob strikes Gary. Gary pulls with even more strength, SpongeBob and Patrick continue singing, but stops after a few seconds after hearing moaning]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you hear that?
[Sandy struggles out of snow pile] [cuts to later, with Sandy also on the sleigh]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Sandy?
Sandy: [shivering] Th-th-th-th-th-thanks, guys.
SpongeBob: No problem, right, Gare?
Gary: [angry] Meow... [continues to pull] Errrgg!
[cuts to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Sniff out the money, little guys! Come on! Marsh! [worms' stomachs growl, and get angry at Mr. Krabs] Wai-wait a minute. I was gonna feed ya! Honest! [worms get angrier]
[cuts back to SpongeBob and others, singing, except Squidward who is still frozen]
Mr. Krabs: [run up to them] Heeelp!
SpongeBob: Hi Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I just been turned into lunchmeat by me own worms! [cuts to furious worms, chasing for him]
SpongeBob: Aaaaa! Hop in, sir! We'll get you out of here!
Mr. Krabs: [quickly rushes into sleigh] Much appreciate it, boy! [sleigh takes off, worms keep chasing]
Everyone except Squidward: Faster! Faster! Faster!
Gary: Mooowww... [tries to go faster]
Everyone: Faster! Faster!
[cuts back and forth between Mr. Krabs' worms and Gary]
Everyone: Faster! [Gary runs in a dead end and stops, tired]
SpongeBob: This is a dead end! [Gary turns around to see the worms entering the dead end]
Everyone: [screaming]
Gary: [like a lion] Rooooooooarr! [after worms run away scared, Gary turns back to normal] Meow. [Everyone stares at Gary for a few seconds, then cheers]
[cheering causes snow at the only road out the dead end collapses and covers the exit]
Mr. Krabs: Great. Now we're trapped.
[cuts to everyone around a fire, made with SpongeBob's hat, but still shivering.
Mr. Krabs: Good thinkin', squirrel! This should keep us alive for at least... a few hours... oh...
Patrick: [shivers] It's-s-s... so c-c-cold!
[SpongeBob's nose with ice on it breaks off, and the ice on Patrick's eyelids shatter off. Gary get so cold he gets into his shell, and apparently he has a warm room with furniture in his shell, he sips his drink. Mr. Krabs' lips shatter off.]
SpongeBob: Hey! How about a campfire song? [Squidward thaws]
Squidward: No Singing!
Everyone: Squidward! [hugs him]
Squidward: [pushes them back] Alright, alright! Someone get me a blanket. [SpongeBob gives him a blanket, Squidward puts it on but still feels cold]
Mr. Krabs: Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?
Squidward: [looks down] Huh? This isn't mine... [foot lifts up] Waaaahhh! [runs]
[Snow Mollusk breaks through snow]
All: [screaming]
[Snow Mollusk roars]
Mr. Krabs: Not you again!
[Snow Mollusk sticks out five tongues from mouth]
Sandy: Ha! Slimey snow vermin! You missed!
Mr. Krabs: That's weren't the attack.
Sandy: Huh?
[Snow Mollusk pulls back tongues with snow on them]
Mr. Krabs: Hit the deck! [Snow Mollusk starts shooting snowballs out of mouth; Mr. Krabs screams and hides behind a pile of snow, blocking the snowballs, Snow Mollusk aims for Gary]
SpongeBob: Gary! [shields Gary with himself, the snowballs go into SpongeBob's holes, and they come out from the side holes. SpongeBob stands up and runs away with Gary. The Snow Mollusk aims for Squidward]
Squidward: [running and screams; jumps into water] Oh no... not again... [floats up in a block of ice again, but with a disappointed face]
Mr. Krabs: She's reloading! Now's our chance to scram. [everyone sneaks away, Sandy brings the sleigh]
SpongeBob: What is that formidable creature?
Mr. Krabs: That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk.
SpongeBob: [shocked]I thought that was just a myth.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I assure you, she's no myth! She's as real as Santy Claus. Twas back when I was young sea captain, [flashback to when Mr. Krabs was a captain] sailing in the Atlantic sea. When the behemith and i first tangled. [Snow Mollusk pops out of sea, young Mr. Krabs gasps, and Snow Mollusk picks up the ship]
SpongeBob: Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled back those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!
Mr. Krabs: Nope, that didn't work. [flashback continues] She gulped me and me crew down in one swift swallow. [Snow Mollusk swallows all people on ship including Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Oh my! Well, at least you bravely escaped to tell the tale.
Mr. Krabs: Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course. [flashback to people in Snow Mollusk's stomach, a bubble floats up and pops, then a flushing sound is heard]
SpongeBob: Hm?[realizing what this really means] Oh! Ew.
Sandy: I'd hate to break up story time, but I'd like to NOT GET EATEN today! [Snow Mollusk's roaring is heard, and everyone gets on sleigh, Snow Mollusk finds them, they leave]
SpongeBob: Gary! Step on it! [Snow Mollusk follows] Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys? [cuts to back of sleigh, and one of the seats are empty with a "Squidward" sign in its place] We forgot Squidward! [sleigh takes a U-turn, and goes between the Snow Mollusk's tentacles] Left, Gary! Left! There he is!
[cuts to Squidward, frozen]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I need a Gooey Worm!
Patrick: Oh, be gentle, it's my last one! [hands SpongeBob a red Gooey Worm]
SpongeBob: Hold on tight! [gives Patrick one end of the Gooey Worm and glides down holding the other one]
Gary: Meow. [as SpongeBob is saving Squidward, the Snow Mollusk finds him]
Patrick: SpongeBob! Come on! [cuts to SpongeBob on Squidward, with Gooey Worm tied on ice block] Let's get outta here! [pulls SpongeBob up, and Snow Mollusk lands on the water. When they are leaving, SpongeBob throws away the Gooey Worm, and falls into Snow Mollusk's mouth when she's getting up, she likes it]
Sandy: Woo, wee! That was a close one, wasn't it, Mr. Krabs? Huh? [in Mr. Krabs' seat, there is a pile of snow with coral as a nose and eyes] Of all the horn swabbles! The banit's trying to weigh us down and make with the prize himself! [throws fake Mr. Krabs out of the sleigh]
[cuts to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Argh argh argh! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish than share me winnings with y-- [jellyfish flies into Mr. Krabs' mouth and stings him.]
[cuts back to others]
Sandy: We can't let that double crosser beat us to the loot! Full speed ahead and don't stop for nothin', Gary!
Patrick: Hey! [takes rope and stops Gary, making the sleigh fling Sandy out]
Sandy: [in snow] What's the big emergency, Patrick?
Patrick: I saw something shiny.
Sandy: [sarcastic] Oh! Well, let's just drop everything, then!
SpongeBob: Oh, wait, Sandy, I see it too! It looks like... Karen.
SpongeBob: [helps Karen up] Karen?
[Karen's screen shows a spinning hourglass]
Sandy: I say she's in swift need of a reboot! Heee ya! [kicks Karen with her boot, shattering the ice on her]
[Karen's screen shows a picture of a computer wife with words "Computer WIFE [progress bar] Loading..." beside it, and soon starts up.]
SpongeBob: [hears someone saying "you can't stand a chance, Krabs"] Huh? [sees fake Plankton and picks it up] Plankton? [fake Plankton says "don't tell Krabs"] Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him.
Patrick: [grabs fake Plankton] Well we gotta bust him out but quick! I'm gonna sit on him! [puts fake Plankton on a rock, preparing to sit on it]
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! He's very--[Patrick sits on fake Plankton]...fragile. [Patrick gets up, showing bits of metal with wires, a speaker, and an eye, broken, it says "Krabs zzz... stand zzz..."]
Sandy: A simulacrum!
SpongeBob: [covers Gary's "ears"] Sandy please! Language!
Sandy: Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!
Karen: That's right. My selfish husband remains in warm, sunny Bikini Bottom, while I freeze my solder off in this bitter tundra. In fact, [cuts to Plankton with fake Plankton and Karen in his lab] this whole race was a plot devised by Plankton. [cuts to Plankton sneaking away before the race] With the entire town distracted, he's free to pursue the Krabby Patty formula undetected.
SpongeBob: Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!
Sandy: And exactly how do you propose we find him?
Karen: I saw Mr. Krabs pass by [screen shows Mr. Krabs running] just before my system failed, heading southwest.
SpongeBob: Well, what are we waiting for? [picks Karen, Sandy, Patrick up and throws them into the sleigh, and gets in himself] You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Mush! Mush!
[cuts to Plankton]
Plankton: [sprays safe with flamethrower] Hehehehe! [touches handle, which is glowing red due to extreme heat] Yeuch! [blows hand] So the safe isn't vulnerable to flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more destructive! [accidentally takes out teddy bear, then puts it back] Ahem! I meant destructive! [takes out a stick of dynamite]
[cuts to SpongeBob and others, going up a steep hill]
Gary: [tired] Mooowww, meow meow meow moooww...
SpongeBob: Attaboy, Gary!
[sleigh gets to the tip of the hill, Gary sees a huge ramp below, screeches and gets in the sleigh.]
All: Ahhhh!
[sleigh goes down the ramp, flies into the air, turns a circle, bounces on three hill tops, and back on the road]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Ahh, whew.
Sandy: Cliff! [cliff ahead]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [both scream]
Sandy: Hold on, SpongeBob! [picks up SpongeBob and throws him on another hill's tip, the sleigh goes in a circle with SpongeBob as the turning point, but Squidward, still frozen, flys off in the progress]
SpongeBob: [with bruises on face, missing teeth and extra long legs and arms] We made it! Hooray! Right, Squidward? [cuts to Squidward falling down]
Sandy: Gasp! Oh, my gosh! Patrick! Lean to the other side! [Patrick turns, and the sleigh goes down following Squidward] Excuse me, ma'am.
Karen: What?
[Sandy pulls off Karen's monitor, stands on SpongeBob, and uses the base's pole and sticks it into the block of ice Squidward is in, and pulls him in]
Sandy: Gotcha!
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, have you given any thoughts on how we're gonna--[sleigh crashes to the ground, making everyone flat]...land? [Snow Mollusk spots them]
[cuts to Krusty Krab's safe with sticks of dynamite wrapped around it]
Plankton: [with a shield] Fire in the hole! [dynamite explodes, and safe is completely fine] Rats.
[cuts back to SpongeBob and others]
Sandy: Alright, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab! [closes one eye]
Patrick: [with lots of ice on eyes] I can't feel my looking holes!
SpongeBob: The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach. [stomach implodes]
Sandy: You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through all my provisions. [holds up empty nut bag] I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about anything! [eyes get bloodshot and drools, then thinks SpongeBob is cooked and on a stick] Mmmm... sponge kabob... [shakes head] Hey Patrick, you got any more of them Gooey Worms on you?
Patrick: I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least, [takes out bag of Jelly Beans] I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over. [eats a Jelly Bean] Hey! Is this taxi even moving?! [Gary shivering] Come on, Gary! [Gary falls]
SpongeBob: Gasp! Gary! [Gary's slime is frozen] Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard on you, didn't we? Sorry buddy, I won't make you tow another inch. [puts Gary in sleigh]
Patrick: Great, now we're stuck.
SpongeBob: No, we're not! [pulls ropes, and his arms shatter] Hello, what's this? [cuts to a small anchor] Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body.
Sandy: We must be heading in the right direction!
[cuts to Krusty Krab]
Plankton: [riding a small plane] [laughing] Secret formula, you are mine! [ejects himself out of plane]
[The plane hits the safe, but the safe is okay]
Plankton: Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one. [landing] That does it! Listen up safe, I will spill your contents, even if I have to tear you apart. [rips a piece of the safe] Bit by bit! [rips the piece he just rips] Molecule by molecule! [rips a molecule] Atom by atom!! [rips an atom, causing it to glow] Uh-oh.
[the atoms explode, obliterating the Krusty Krab and the safe]
Plankton: Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa! [takes the bottle containing the secret formula]
[cuts to SpongeBob and his friends] [SpongeBob is still dragging the sleigh, then suddenly hits something]
Patrick: [wakes up] Hey, i'm trying to sleep.
SpongeBob: [realizes that he hits Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Sandy: He ain't looking so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob?[realizes SpongeBob is frozen] He froze up too. [realizes that the others also frozen. Makes a fire form the sleigh to thaw them out]
Squidward: Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh!? Are you aware that that was our only mode of transportation?
Sandy: And are you aware I just saved your life?
Mr. Krabs: The race! The million clams! [gasps] I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings. [rattles Squidward]
Karen: Oh cool down there are no winnings, you've been duped!
Mr. Krabs: Duped? You don't mean by...
Karen: Now you're putting it together!
Mr. Krabs: My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!
Squidward:  We might actually have a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.
Mr. Krabs: We're doomed. [cries]
SpongeBob:  No we're not Mr. Krabs. [turns himself into sleigh] Your chariot awaits!
Mr. Krabs: No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace.
Sandy: Just leave that to the scientist of the group!
Patrick:  Oh geez. Why do I have to do everything?
Sandy: [Sandy creates a modified sleigh. Patrick is spinning from Karen's monitor as Squidward blows his clarinet onto the circuits]
Patrick: Hahahaha!
Sandy: She's all fired up!
SpongeBob: Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?
Mr. Krabs: Lookin' clear so far.
SpongeBob: Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!
French Narrator: One frozen wasteland later.
SpongeBob: Hooray! We made it.
Mr. Krabs: Okay... then where's my restaurant?
SpongeBob: Perhaps over there.. [points to smoldering place]
Mr. Krabs: And where's my formula? [runs over to safe]
Sandy: [points to Chum Bucket] Perhaps over there.
Mr. Krabs: The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?! [reading Chum Bucket sign]
SpongeBob: We're too late!
Mr. Krabs: We'll see about that boy-o!
Harold: [Mr. Krabs walks past line] Whoa whoa whoa whoa, you can't cut in line. We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!
Mr. Krabs: This will only take a minute. [smashes door]
Plankton:  Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open. [tries to open cork from the formula bottle]
Mr. Krabs: Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!
Plankton: Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?
Mr. Krabs: I guess I didn't want to miss the big unveiling of my sandwich.
Plankton:  Well, it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!
Patrick: Oh, that's easy! [lifts it out of the bottle.]
All of them: Patrick!
Plankton: Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy. [beings to run away]
Sandy:  That may be true, Plankton, but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides.
Plankton:&#160;: Uh... well, I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!
Karen: [sarcastically] You've gotta help me... My monitor nearly froze up for good on your little race to oblivion!
Plankton: Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon! [Karen zaps Plankton]
Plankton: Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Then hand over my formula.
Plankton: Okay, Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first. [He pulls out a pen and clicks it. It turns into a propeller.] Oop! Here I go! Hahahaha! Out smarted you again, aye, fools? [laughs and flies away into a pipe]
Mr. Krabs: You get back here, Plankton!
Squidward:  Here we go again...
Plankton: [exits through a vent outside the Chum Bucket, with everyone in close pursuit]
Mr. Krabs: Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!
Plankton: I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh! You're so close. [Plankton runs up some stair, and hops on top of something. The others follow him.] So long, suckers!
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Everyone: [gasps when they realize they’re inside a cage]
Plankton: Hehehe!
Mr. Krabs: We're trapped!
Plankton: That's right, Krabs, and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you.
Mr. Krabs: He's going to turn us into fried snacks!
Patrick: Got any dipping sauce?
Plankton: A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?
Abominable Snow Mollusk:  [makes loud noise, and grabs the cage] Nom nom!
SpongeBob: Nom nom?
Abominable Snow Mollusk: Nom nom! [rips the cage open, making everyone in it fall to the ground. She then snatches Patrick] Nom nom!
SpongeBob: W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me, i'm packed with nutrients!
Sandy: No, eat me!
Mr. Krabs: Don't eat me, eat Squidward!
Squidward: Wait, what?!
Abominable Snow Mollusk:  [reaches and takes jellybeans from Patrick’s pocket] Nom nom! [hugs Patrick]
SpongeBob: She loves your jellybeans, Patrick!
Plankton: I better go while the going's good.
Abominable Snow Mollusk:  [sees Plankton] Jellybean!
Plankton: I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now! [The Abominable Mollusk grabs him with her tongue; Plankton screams as she swallows him and Plankton releases the formula. It lands onto Mr. Krabs' claw and he puts it in his shirt.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?
Mr. Krabs: He'll just have to wait for nature to take its course. [laughs]
Plankton: [The Abominable Snow mollusk belches and inside her stomach shows Plankton sitting on a jellybean.] Well, I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration. [a flushing noise is then heard in the background, concluding the episode]


[episode opens to the Krusty Krab and we see Squidward reading a magazine that says Everybody Ablomp Now. He then looks from the magazine and see a bunch of fish on the tables staring at him. Squidward twitches his eyebrows in a suspicious way. One of the customers slowly closes his eyes and opened it back. Squidward jumps by this and another customer falls over and licks the floor. Everyone appears like they're about to have seizures]
Squidward: [whispers with clenched teeth] SpongeBob, why aren't those orders up yet? [Cut to the scene where we see two fishes with forks and knives and they're moaning like zombies. Squidward is stunned by this. Scene cuts to the kitchen. He pokes his head through the window]. SpongeBob, the collective blood sugar around here is dangerously low. [looks down on the grill to see some cards on it] Why are you grilling index cards? [close up to the index cards that talks about boating school]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted. [holding up an index card] I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow.
Squidward: You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. Now get those orders ready!
SpongeBob: Okay! Okay! [takes off his hat and shoves out seven patties from inside it] Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway? You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. It's really no different to what I do everyday.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob coming out of the kitchen with a Krabby Patty and gets shocked. We see a bunch of fish looking like zombies]
SpongeBob: No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them... [Cut to the scene where we see the customers moaning and the background changes to swirls] ...front of them looking... [SpongeBob backs away slowly to the kitchen] ...at me [closes the kitchen door. He peaks through the window and sees the customers] ...with their eyes! [He shrieks and ducks] Squidward is right! Public speaking is frightening!
Squidward: [grabs the Krabby Patty from SpongeBob] Must I do everything myself? [looks to his left] Huh? Stay back! You'll get your patty when it's your turn. [Squidward gets pulled back, all customers begin to physically fight for the Krabby Patty, results Squidward getting beaten up. SpongeBob stretches his legs up and peaks over at the window. He looks at the fight and ducks as a barrel crashes in his direction. SpongeBob pulls back steadily]
SpongeBob: I never knew an audience can get so physical. [Squidward screams and is thrown to the back and is continuously mauled by the zombified customers] This changes everything. [He slowly creeps away as Squidward still gets beaten up.. Scene bubbles over to Patrick's Rock and Patrick goes over to it and opens it. We see SpongeBob on the rock]
Patrick: Oh, sorry, wrong rock. [Patrick turns to leave but SpongeBob stretches his arms to grab Patrick and takes him under the rock.. Scene cuts to the inside of Patrick's home where we see that SpongeBob made it look exactly like the inside of Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes.
Patrick: Okay. [starts pulling at his eyes] Uhhh...
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, you can keep them. I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here. [referring to the little platform he made out of sand] Just pretend you're a student at his desk.
Patrick: Okay. [goes over to one of the desks made of sand and sits on it]
SpongeBob: [Gets on the little platform and holds up an index card]
Patrick: H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class. [He moves the sand desk a little farther, stops, then moves up a little]
SpongeBob: Okay, here goes. [reads] Boating safety is...
Patrick: SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass?
SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick. Just sit tight and let me practice.
Patrick: Fine.
SpongeBob: [clears throat] Boating safe...
Patrick: Boring! Next!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here. Just focus on me, huh?
Patrick: All right, all right. [looks closely toward SpongeBob. Cut to a close-up of Patrick's face and he blinks his eyes]
SpongeBob: So, without further ado... [He sees that Patrick has fallen asleep] Patrick? [taps Patrick's forehead] Patrick, wake up. [Patrick slowly wakes up] What happened, Patrick?
Patrick: Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect?
Patrick: Yes! And you should be prepared for worse.
SpongeBob: Worse?
Patrick: You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. You gotta be ready. Now try again.
SpongeBob: Okay. [stands on the small platform] Boating safety... [A pillow is thrown at his face] Boating safe... [More pillows are thrown at SpongeBob and we see that Patrick is the one that's throwing the pillows-fed up with his oral speaking, wants him to either stop or present more better and interesting]
Patrick: That's it! [grunts] Fight through! [SpongeBob is buried in a pile of pillows, but he rises up from the pile panting]
SpongeBob: Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!
Patrick: Says you! Speech!
SpongeBob: Boating safe...
[Patrick walks up to him dressed up like Mrs. Puff]
Patrick: [imitating Mrs. Puff] SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom.
SpongeBob: Uh, you sorta add a hand in that, too, Patrick.
Patrick: [imitating Mrs. Puff] Young man, how dare you?! [He writes into a small notebook, tears a paper out, and hands it to SpongeBob, which is a detention slip]
SpongeBob: What, a detention slip?
Patrick: [imitating Mrs. Puff] I'm not hearing your oral report.
SpongeBob: Okay. [reads] Boating safe... [A treadmill is place under him and he's running on it]
Patrick: Try again.
SpongeBob: [panting] Boating safety... [Patrick bangs on cymbals causing SpongeBob to lose his balance and hang on the handles]
Patrick: Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do?
SpongeBob: Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working. [As he is saying this his body starts to shred into a pile of yellow dust with his arms on top of it due to his body being on the treadmill]
Patrick: [shouts] Speech! [SpongeBob turns to normal and yells] Speech! Speech! Speech! [SpongeBob gets nervous] Speech! Speech! Speech! [SpongeBob shivers. Now Patrick's eyes are talking] Speech! Speech! Speech! [Now SpongeBob is more nervous] Speech! Speech! Spee -
SpongeBob: Patrick, stop! Somehow your help just isn't helping. I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything. [shudders]
Patrick: Yeah, you do look pretty terrible.
SpongeBob: Well, if I don't do my report, then I don't pass. And if I don't pass, then I don't get my boating license! [starts crying]
Patrick: Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws. [holds up his hands that look exactly like a squirrel's] Maybe she can make you a fake one.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers!
Patrick: Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya. [SpongeBob looks surprised at what Patrick says. Scene bubbles over to Sandy who is examining SpongeBob with her magnifying glass]
Sandy: Hmm... White knuckles, leaky pores, and stomach in knots. Y-y-yep. He does look pretty bad. SpongeBob, you're afflicted with severe oral report-itis. You know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode. Ker-pow!
SpongeBob: [shudders]
Sandy: It has been scientifically proven that [pulls a paper down with a person on it] 85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear.
[SpongeBob's hand take the clothes off the person and he covers his underwear. He tears the page to cover his underwear]
Sandy: Everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous! Which is why I invented these. [shows an underwear with goggles stuck to it] Goggles that let you see people in your undies. Or, I could just make you a fake boating license.
SpongeBob: That's still illegal. Give me the goggles! [puts on the goggles but nothing's happening] It's not working.
Sandy: Well, of course it isn't, silly! I'm only wearing my undies. See if it works on Patrick.
SpongeBob: [turns to Patrick. He jumps at this] Eh! Ooh, they work.
[Scene bubbles over to Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
Billy: ...and they were never heard from again.
Mrs. Puff: Thank you, Billy. That was an excellent report. Next we have-- [crosses off Billy, then sees SpongeBob] --SpongeBob SquarePants. Ugh.
Patrick: [zooms over to SpongeBob] Go on, buddy.
SpongeBob: [gives Patrick a thumbs up. He gets out of his seat and goes to the front of the room. He clears his throat and then freezes. Cut to the other side of the class. Cut to SpongeBob. He gulps]
Mrs. Puff: Well, SpongeBob? Do you have your oral report ready?
SpongeBob: [in a small voice] Huh...?
Mrs. Puff: The assignment I gave you. The one where you talk in front of the class.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! Of course I'm ready! [starts sweating] I can do it. [Shubie checks her watch] Um... [Scene goes across the room. In another scene, the background is yellow. It also shows angry people and Patrick about to throw a pillow at him] Oh, no. Oh, no!
Mrs. Puff: What are you doing?!
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this?
Mrs. Puff: No. Only if you want to pass this class!
SpongeBob: Okay. [walks to the front of the room] Uh, my report...is on... [his pinky starts to vibrate. He holds it] Heh! Must be last-minute jitters! [starts to vibrate too. He goes all around the front of the room and stops where he was before] Patrick, where are those goggles?
Patrick: Right here. Let me polish them up for ya. [rubs his arm on the lens and it breaks] Here ya go.
SpongeBob: Thanks! [puts them on]
Billy: Hurry up! [in his underwear]
SpongeBob: [gasps; sees other people are in their underwear, too] Ha, ha, it's working! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ...
Mrs. Puff: What's all this laughing about? [is wearing a bra and underwear] Well, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [laughs] "Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the ocean because -- [his broken lens start to function weird. Billy's underwear now has a scary face on it]
Scary Face: Well, don't just stand there! Get on with it!
SpongeBob: [screams as he sees the other underwear with scary faces on them] They're all staring! [throws the hat on the floor and runs out the door]
Patrick: Hey, where are you going? You forgot your goggles! SpongeBob, wait! [SpongeBob drives a boat] SpongeBob!
Mrs. Puff: You can't take my boat! SpongeBob!
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob!
Mrs. Puff: Get back here with my boat!
Police Officer: I don't know, slow day at the office, huh?
Police Officer #2: You said it, partner! My baton's itching for the noggin of a lawbreaker.
SpongeBob: [screams as he runs a stop sign]
Police Officer: Okay, forget what I just said. [Police Officer #1 and #2 chase after him]
Police Officer: Sponge, pull over!
SpongeBob: I don't know how!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob breaks through three houses, smashes into the next one and goes flying and lands on his head]
Police Officer: All right, kid, what was that all about?
Police Officer #2: Don't you know anything about boating safety?
SpongeBob: [he looks surprised] Boating safety? Well, yes, Officer. I do. [he gets back on his feet] Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean. Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook. When the meaning of all important signs... ...pay attention to all surroundings... ...when wet means no parking... ...it already figures... ...always blah blah blah... ...with all shades of curve... ...remember... ...a motor vehicle is 20,000 pounds of blah blah--
Police Officer #2: Gee, kid. [wipes a tear from his eye] That was beautiful.
Police Officer: Yeah. I never even knew some of those things myself.
Mrs. Puff: Aha! Finally! The long arm of the laws caught up with you! I guess I won't be seeing you in my driver's education class for the next 5 to 10 years! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Police Officer: Wait, wait, Miss Chuckles, did you say you were his boating instructor?
Mrs. Puff:  [getting nervous] Yes. Why?
Police Officer: Under penal code 26-1 quote, "The boating instructor is responsible--"
SpongeBob: --"for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care".
Police Officer: Unquote. I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in, ma'am. [handcuffs Mr. Puff and puts her in the police car]
Mrs. Puff: What?! Nooo!
Patrick: Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of getting an oral talking thing.
SpongeBob: Hey, I did! Thanks, pal!
Patrick: Oh, that reminds me. [shows the hat] You forgot these. [puts them on] Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work! Heh! [the scary face appears]
Scary Face: And, what are you lookin' at?
Patrick: [screams and runs away]


SpongeBob: [whistles musically]
Squidward: SpongeBob, what is that horrible racket coming from back here?
SpongeBob: Just a little grill-side harmony. Everyone knows that cooking and music go together like... eating and listening.
Squidward: You wouldn't know what real music is if it came up and hit you in the face.
SpongeBob: Hey, that happened to Patrick once. He must've been listening to hard rock. [laughs] He had a lump on his head—
Squidward:  I don't care! If you want to hear what real music sounds like, then listen to this. [inhales, plays clarinet off-key, customers jeering negative comments as they run out of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs takes the clarinet] Hey, give it back. I was just reaching my coda.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, well your coda is affecting me quota. The shrill piercing racket of your fish flute is frightening away me money.
Squidward: Fish flute?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know. That's what they used to call it back in the—
Squidward: None of you simpletons would recognize real musical talent if it came up and kicked you in the face!
SpongeBob: Hey, that happened to Patrick once, too! He—
Squidward: None of you know a great musician when you hear him! Not a single one of you! Not even—even—oh, there's nobody there.
Plankton: He's still doing it, Karen. He's— Karen?
Karen: Who's doing what, now?
Plankton: The skinny one. He's been ranting and raving in front of the Krusty Krab for the past half-hour, waving his arms and jumping around like an animal. Oh, he stopped now. He's just broken down on the ground, crying. Karen, Karen, for the first time, it's hit me!
Karen: What, the door on your way out?
Plankton: No, computer-brain. The skinny one may have been the gateway to the secret formula all along. As a veteran employee, he must know the secret formula, too.
Karen: [sighs] I warn you against it.
Plankton: Too late! [laughs evilly, whistles casually, clears throat]
Squidward: Who said that?
Plankton: Down here! I am just an innocent passerby who felt the need to stop and tell you what a magnificent garden you have.
Squidward: Oh, really?
Plankton: Yes.
Squidward: Well, let me tell you something, mister. I know exactly who you are and why you're here.
Plankton: You do?
Squidward: You will not get me to eat at the Chum Bucket, no matter how big the discount is.
Plankton: Well, that's not exactly why I—
Squidward: Shameless. You again?
Plankton: I hope you don't mind me painting on your property, but the light here, it's simply transcendent this time of day.
Squidward: [sighs] Why, yes, it is, isn't it?
Plankton: Yes, it—not buying that one either, huh?
Squidward: Nope. [Plankton knocks on door]
Plankton: Hey, buddy! [door slams] Squidward! [door slams] Free cleaning service? [door slams] Census taker. [door slams] Good day, kind sir. Would you like to buy some Gil Scout cookies? [door slams] Ow! [tape rips]
Karen: Plankton, what are you doing?
Plankton: There's nothing a little duct tape and surgical tubing can't accomplish. [grunts] Ow! I knew I should've used pipe cleaners. Hello, I'm your long-lost relative. Can I have the secret formula? [Squidward kicks Plankton, door slams]
Plankton: Well, that's a fine way to treat a family member.
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton. Nice dress.
Plankton: Out of my way, SpongeBrain.
SpongeBob: I overheard you and Squidward playing doorslam and I wanted to see if I could get in to the next round. [Plankton cries] Don't cry, Plankton. Doorslam is easy to play. Hard to master.
Plankton: None of my tactics are making any impression on him whatsoever.
SpongeBob: Well, let's see. If you really want to impress Squidward, try talking to him about music.
Plankton: Music?
SpongeBob: Yeah, especially his favorite kind of music, his own.
Plankton: Oh, is that right?
Squidward: [sings to himself, grumbles] Not again.
Plankton: Wait, don't irrigate me. I've come to hear your music. It soothes the place my soul would occupy if I had one.
Squidward: Are you sure you got the right squid?
Plankton: I've never been sure of anything, but I am sure of this: play for me. Fill my ear sockets with the strains of your sweet, sweet magic. [eyelashes squish]
Squidward: Finally, someone actually appreciates my brilliance. I will play for you, my tiny cyclops. I will play such that Neptune himself will hear me upon his very throne... or whatever chair he's sitting on.
Plankton: Uh-oh. I mean, goodie.
Squidward: [inhales, plays his clarinet off-key, Plankton strains and growls]
Plankton: Sweet mother of Aphrodite! Please make it end!
Squidward: Huh, huh? How are you enjoying the music so far?
Plankton: It's delightful! [Squidward plays his clarinet off-key again, earplugs pop in Plankton's ears] Bravo! [whoops, whistles, claps] Encore, encore! Yes, yes, bravo, bravo! Whoo-hoo!
Squidward: [sighs] My very own fan. [clarinet plays off-key]
Gus: Did you hear that?
Nazz-Mimi: How could I not? [beachgoers yell]
Plankton: Bravo!
Lifeguard: No, no! Make it stop! [splashes into goo, the crowd jeers and pelts Squidward and Plankton with fruit]
Plankton: Encore, encore, encore!
Squidward: I'm so glad you're enjoying the performance.
Plankton: Enjoying it? Why, I'm enjoying it so much, it's making me want to... it's making me want to...
Squidward: Want to... sing?
Plankton: That's the word I was looking for!
Squidward: A-one, a-two, a-one, a-two, a-three, a-four. [jazzy music begins]
Plankton: ♪Skinny arms a flappin' long nose looks real swell. Shiny head is bulging he plays really well. On the fact that he's a genius you can surely bet. This strange-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet.♪ [Squidward plays riffs]♪To hear his music playing is like, uh, music to my ears. His delightful melodies reduce grown men to tears. If you haven't heard this mollusk play you ain't hear nothing yet. This funny-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet.♪ [Squidward plays riffs, fireworks explode]♪No one does it better. He's the best there is. When you ask him how he does it he says...♪
Squidward: It's all in the wrist. [plays off-key tune]
Plankton: Hooray!
Squidward: Thank you, thank you.
Plankton: Say, uh, musical genius?
Squidward: Yes?
Plankton: When you're not sharing your songs of joy and splendor, one might find you working a shift at the Krusty Krab, correct?
Squidward: It is an unfortunate truth.
Plankton: And you've been working there for a pretty long time, haven't you?
Squidward: That's an understatement.
Plankton: Well, I... I was just wondering, O incredibly musical one, what do they put in one of those Krabby Patties, anyway... secret-wise?
Squidward: Oh, I don't work the grill; I work the register. [plays clarinet]
Plankton: But... surely, you've been near the grill. You must've seen something.
Squidward: Nope. Haven't seen a thing. [continues playing]
Plankton: You work in the same place for 20 years and you've never noticed ingredients of the sole item on your menu? Cut the comedy, octopus! I want that formula and I want it now!
Squidward: Oh, don't you see, Sheldon? Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician.
Plankton: What?
Squidward: It's been your constant encouragement that has helped me progress to new musical heights. I'm hitting notes I never even knew existed. [inhales, plays clarinet off-key, windows shatter]
Mrs. Puff: We have— [glass shattering]
Sandy: Mayday! Mayday!
Squidward: In fact, thanks to you, I'm going to quit my job at the Krusty Krab and become a full-time musician.
Plankton: But then I'll never get my hands on that secret formula. [growls, ear plugs pop] Uh-oh. My professional-grade earplugs! No! [earplugs sproing, Squidward begins to inhale, Plankton goes after the earplugs] Come back, I need you! [clarinet plays off-key; Plankton screams and takes the clarinet] Stop playing this infernal pipe! You're killing me!
Squidward: Hey! [panting] Come back!
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. I heard you and Plankton out here playing "doorslam" and I was wondering if I could—Squidward: Plankton stole my clarinet and I have to get it back!
SpongeBob: Whoo! I wanna play!
Plankton: [pants] Aha! Okay, fish-flute, time to play a little avant-garde. Guardrail, that is. [laughs, he slides down a staircase with the clarinet and keeps running, SpongeBob and Squidward fall down and start to grunt and groan]
SpongeBob: Ouch, Squidward, this game is fun!
Plankton: You'll never catch me, you hear! Never!
Police fish #1: We've got you surrounded.
Plankton: You do? Oh.
Police fish #1: We've received hundreds of reports of an excruciating musical disturbance and you're the only one holding an instrument.
Plankton: Wait a minute, I've never seen this instrument before in my life.
SpongeBob: He's right, officer. Plankton doesn't even play clar— [mumbles as Mr. Krabs covers his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: There, there, laddie. Just let the legal system run its course.
Police officer #1: Watch your head. [puts Plankton in police car]
Plankton: No, wait! Please! Karen, help!
Police officer #1: Oh, you won't be needing this where you're going. [police siren wails, then the police car runs over the clarinet destroying it]
SpongeBob: Boy, that was a close one, huh, Squidward? He almost got your clarinet. [clarinet snaps]
Squidward: Once again, I hate people.


[The episode starts with the Krusty Krab at nighttime. The scene cuts to the interior, where we see Squidward sleeping at the counter with a magazine on his face, then an alarm clock rings, Squidward wakes up and stops it. The scene then cuts to SpongeBob about to flip a Krabby Patty and then Squidward pokes his head through the window.]
Squidward: It's quitting time, SpongeBob. Go home. [SpongeBob continues to flip the patty] Quitting time! [SpongeBob sniffs the patty, Squidward takes out a megaphone and shouts in it] Go home! [SpongeBob continues to ignore Squidward and flips the patty, he then looks at his watch]
SpongeBob: Oh my. It's time to go home. Squidward, what are you still doing here?
[Squidward gets frustrated and screams, running out of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [picking up the patty] What am I gonna do with you? I can't throw you away. [snaps his finger, laughs, and puts the patty inside his wallet, then a smelly odor flies in and SpongeBob sniffs it] Bleh! [the scene cuts to the garbage can where we can see the smelly odor is coming from] But I do have to throw away the trash.
[the scene cuts to the back of the Krusty Krab, the door opens and a big smelly smoke comes out followed by SpongeBob who is wearing a gas mask while holding the trash can, he walks over to the dumpster and dumps all the trash into it, then a book covered with trash comes up from the dumpster]
SpongeBob: [takes off his gas mask and picks up a book] What's this? Someone threw away a book. You shouldn't throw away books. [suddenly a big green slimy monster emerges from the dumpster. SpongeBob screams at the sight of it. He then throws the books at it, causing it to fall over. The slime dissolves to reveal that it was actually Sandy] Ooh, Sandy, you're a trash monster?
Sandy: Heck no. I was breaking a record for rooting around in a trash bin. It's all right here in The Guinness O' Ripley Enormous Book Of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records. [turns page] Look-e here, SpongeBob. Staring Record. 5 days. Most fries up nose. Holding your breath.
SpongeBob: Wow!
Sandy: Yes siree! I swear by the power of Texas, I'm gonna break all the records in this here book!
[the scene cuts to the treedome]
Sandy: What's the next challenge?
SpongeBob: Let's see. Ooh. World's longest tongue.
Sandy: Well, that's easy. [scene cuts to Sandy's tongue, SpongeBob is pulling Sandy's tongue] 106, 107...
SpongeBob: Hold tight, Sandy.
Sandy: ...108, 109, 110!
SpongeBob: That's it, Sandy! You did it!
Sandy: Yeehaw! [Sandy crashes into SpongeBob]
[the scene cuts to SpongeBob reading The Guinness O' Ripley Enormous Book of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records]
SpongeBob: Let's see... Yikes! Sweet mother of Pearl!
Sandy: Is it dangerous?
SpongeBob: Yeah, you could say that. You have to eat as much chum as you can.
Sandy: Chum, huh? That's not too bad.
SpongeBob: Raw!
Sandy: [sputters] Raw?!
[the scene cuts to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: You want what?
SpongeBob: One order of chum, please.
Sandy: Raw.
Plankton: Look, I know I'm an evil heartless mastermind, but no one can ingest raw chum and survive!
SpongeBob: Oh yeah? Well, Charlie Mackeral, the current record holder did.
Plankton: Really?
SpongeBob: For 30 seconds.
Plankton: Well, it's your funeral.
[the scene cuts back at the treedome, SpongeBob is in a toxic-proof suit. He grabs a spoon of chum and walks to Sandy who is cuffed]
SpongeBob: Ok, Sandy, eat up.
Sandy: Uh, SpongeBob, I changed my mummh... [SpongeBob shoves the chum in Sandy's mouth. Sandy screams breaking free] Must! Make! World! Record!
SpongeBob: Sandy, you did it! You survived! [chicken clucks, SpongeBob sees Sandy lying on the floor] Uh, oh. Hold on, Sandy! [takes off helmet] I know just what you need! [SpongeBob gasps and reaches into his wallet to grab a Krabby Patty] A Krabby Patty! [SpongeBob puts the Krabby Patty in her mouth and helps her chew and she rises up like as a rooster crows, Sandy coughs and gasps]
Sandy: I did it! I'm alive! I can't wait to show them experts the pictures of my record breaking feats.
SpongeBob: Oh no! I forgot my camera!
Sandy: What?! SpongeBob! I need photographic proof of my amazing deeds!
SpongeBob: I'll go get the camera.
Sandy: Well, hurry up! I got record breaking to do!
[cuts to later on]
SpongeBob: Oh my. [sees robots]
Sandy: Got your camera?
SpongeBob: You bet ya! [camera gets shown]
Sandy: Great! Take a picture of me chucking this last woodchuck to break the woodchuck chuckin' world record. Ready Cousin Earl?
Cousin Earl: Let er' rip darlin'! [Sandy chucks Cousin Earl and SpongeBob takes a picture]
Record Robot: 100 woodchucks chucked. Record broken!
Sandy: Thanks for all your help, cousins! [cousins cheer] See you all next Christmas! Bye! [the woodchucks were sucked and spirited up]
SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy! What is all this?
Sandy: I've decided to go about this scientifically. I feel with careful planning an precise dedication of appropriate tasks, I can manage the successful completion of the maximum number of records broken in the least amount of time! Book! Picture!
SpongeBob: [hands the picture] Here you go.
Sandy: Thank you. [places the picture. She giggles] So, what's next? Oh yeah, longest tooth. So how's the calcium fusion going?
Robot: It is ready, Ms. Cheeks.
Sandy: Outstanding! Here, hold this. [robot holds the book as Sandy administers the shot and the tooth grows. It continues to grow until she hits her head on the ceiling of the treedome] How'd I do?
Record Robot: Please hold this end. [SpongeBob holds the end of the ruler as the robot stretches high] 35 feet. Record broken! [SpongeBob flies up to the ceiling, crashes making him fit in his helmet]
SpongeBob: Ouch!
Record Robot: Take a picture.
SpongeBob: Say "cheese"!
Sandy: Cheese! [Sandy saws a giant part of the tooth off of her top tooth and slides down] Picture!
SpongeBob: Here you go.
Sandy: Thank you. Next, spiciest chili gargle. [Sandy gargles on chili as SpongeBob takes a picture]
SpongeBob: Got it! You OK? [Sandy breathes fire, SpongeBob sniffs] Do you smell soup?
Sandy: What's next?
Record Robot: Largest rubber band ball. [SpongeBob takes a picture, as Sandy lets go of the rubber band ball, SpongeBob gets crushed]
Sandy: Woohoo! What's next?
Record Robot: Most cobras milked. [Sandy milks cobras]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Say "cheese"!
Sandy: Cheese! [SpongeBob takes a picture]
SpongeBob: [nervous laugh] Nice snakes. [gets squeezed]
Sandy: Next!
Record Robot: Most walnuts in mouth. [Sandy gets a lot of walnuts in her mouth]
Sandy: Just! One! More! Oh no! [spits out walnuts at SpongeBob] Next!
Record Robot: Most chainsaws juggled.
Sandy: Ok, shoot!
SpongeBob: [takes a picture] Got it! So uh how do you stop?
Sandy: What?
SpongeBob: I said "How do you stop?"
Sandy: What?
SpongeBob: How do you stop?
Sandy: Why that's easy I just stop and run like heck! [SpongeBob and Sandy run] Not that way! [Sandy walks over to SpongeBob who is cut apart from the chain saws] Come on, SpongeBob! Pull yourself together! We still got a ton of records to break! Oh yeah! You're gonna love this one!
SpongeBob: [putting himself together] I don't know, Sandy. It is getting kinda dangerous.
Sandy: Come on, you don't need your helmet. This one's outside! Follow me.
SpongeBob: Oh my.
Sandy: There it is, the world's largest house of cards!
SpongeBob: That's amazing! Get in front so I can take a picture.
Sandy: Nah, let's get a shot from the top!
Patrick: What the...? Oh hey, it's Solitaire! I love this game! I take a touchdown! [Patrick ruins the world's largest house cards as SpongeBob and Sandy scream when they fall from the top]
Sandy: What's next?
SpongeBob: Um, I think I smell Gary's sandbox better go clean it. Now! [the scene cuts at SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob goes to clean Gary's litter box] I think you broke a record today, Gary. World's Stinkiest Litter box! Eww! [SpongeBob almost vomited] I'm worried about Sandy. She's got record-breaking fever!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right. She does need my help. I must stop this madness! It's all that book's fault! The book is evil! The book must be destroyed!
[SpongeBob walks into the treedome and kills the robot to disguise]
SpongeBob: [robot voice] Why don't you take 5? I will hold the book.
Robot: Thank Neptune's gears. My wheels are killing me.
[SpongeBob put the book in his disguise but Sandy doesn't recognize him]
Sandy: Hey! Where do you think you're going? Get back in line. I need every available robot for this one. Most Robots built and destroyed in a day.
Record Robot: 656, 657... Oh, the artificial humanity.
Robot: [SpongeBob tries sneaking out of the line] Oh no you don't! We're all in this together! [SpongeBob screams] [SpongeBob and robot get crushed together and are sent though a carver belt]
Record Robot: 679. Record broken!
Sandy: OK shut her down!
Robot: Oh my!
Sandy: What's wrong with you?
Robot: My stomach feels funny.
Sandy: Well, let's have a look. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh hey, Sandy. [robot groans]
Sandy: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: I came to save you from, from this book. I'm going to destroy it before someone gets killed! I don't wanna lose you, Sandy! [sobs] I don't wanna lose you!
Sandy: Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob. I'm done with that book! I've beat every record in here. In fact, I've been finding the author who verified my evidence.
Author: Thank you. [looking through the book] Yes... Oh my... well then... I'm afraid you've broken no records.
SpongeBob and Sandy: Huh?
Author: This book is 30 years old. These records were broken ages ago. You however have sent a brand new record: Most injuries sustained while helping a friend.
Sandy: Good for you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [cracks] Um, hurray!
Author: Say "cheese"! [takes a picture as the episode ends]


[the episode starts at SpongeBob's House]
SpongeBob: [hands Gary a bowl of food. Gary takes a bite of the food and SpongeBob puts on his Krusty Krab hat. He then opens the door and sees Patrick, whimpering, and he jumps onto SpongeBob's couch] What's the matter, buddy? You seem so sad.
Patrick: [angrily] Oh yeah, well uh, you know what's sad? This. [points to and touches SpongeBob's hat]
SpongeBob: My hat is sad?
Patrick: No! You have a special hat, which means you get to go to your special-happy-worky place. While I just stay... [turns around and whimpers some more] bored all day. I want a special-happy-worky place, too! [cries]
SpongeBob: First thing's first, Patrick. What do you like to do?
Patrick: Uhhh... [drools; zooms into Patrick's head and shows an oval image of an tidal wave with a large breeze passing by blowing sand] Sand.
SpongeBob: Oof! [SpongeBob turns around and slaps his head] Ooh, I gotta run. I have patties to flip, [runs to the door] but I sure hope you figure your problem out. Think about it. [closes the door]
Patrick: Think about it. Think, Patrick, think. Hmmmmm... hmmpphh! [Patrick's head swells up like a balloon and pops.] Thinking is painful. [swings his deflated head over to look like a ponytail] Break time. [Walks over to SpongeBob's chair, sits down, picks up the remote and turns on the TV. TV shows commercial of Nicholas Withers on a small boat with three other fish in the background laying down and relaxing]
Nicholas Whithers: Are you irritable? Listless? Jobless? Have you ever asked yourself: "I'm a loser. What am I doing with my life?" Well, look no further. I have an answer that has helped millions- [Patrick changes channel. TV shows commercial of dolphins swimming and frolicking]
Announcer: Be all you can possibly be. [dolphin noise] Join the Marine Dolphins. [dolphin noise followed by Patrick changing the channel. TV then shows Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cornered by Man Ray with a raygun in his hand]
Man Ray: Muhahahahahahahaha! [Display case falls on Man Ray] Huh? [action card shows: “Clang!”] The inescapable display case! [Bangs on the case] Noooooooooo!
Barnacle Boy: [shakes Mermaid Man's hand] All in a day's work, ehh, Mermaid Man? [both superheroes face the screen]
Mermaid Man: Remember: It's up to you [points up with hand] to reveal the true face of crime. Sign up to be part of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Junior Crime Fighters. [Patrick turns off TV]
Patrick: [gets out of chair.] I gotta figure out what to do in my life. [Patrick steps on Mermaid Man doll that says: "Fight evilllllllll!". Patrick then picks up the toy] Awww, I wish I was a superhero. [Patrick's eyes burst in, then back out] I know what I want to do with my life! To the changing room! [rushes to the changing room followed by a real sea star spinning towards then away from the screen] [scene transition cuts to Patrick pulling out his underwear and putting it on over his pants. Patrick then attempts to put a belt with a buckle with a star on it on, but is hard to put on because of his fat body. He then succeeds and clips the buckle in place] Ahhhhh. [His body fat then bursts in between his belly and his pectorals. He grabs a giant ice cream cone from SpongeBob's fridge, suddenly, with two blue gloves on his hands, and eats the ice cream and a portion of the cone. With ice cream on his mouth, he then slips the cone on his head and bulges his eyes through it. He grabs a jar of seanut butter and writes a backwards P on his chest with seanut butter on his tongue] At last I have found my calling. I am Patrick-Man: defender of Bikini Bottom! [Runs out the front door, then trips on a rock. He gets up and continues running]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what's with all the dilly-dallyin'? We got customer's money  to take!
Squidward: Where? [The Krusty Krab is empty]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Where is everybody?
[The doors open and Patrick appears at the doorway]
Patrick: Fear not, Patrick-Man is here.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick! I knew our number one customer wouldn't let us down. [Patrick comes towards Mr. Krabs to cover his mouth and begins shushing him]
Patrick: It's Patrick-Man, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick-Man? What kind of ridiculous name is that?
Squidward: Oh, forget the name. Look at the ridiculous outfit. What is that? A pair of briefs?
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs start laughing as Patrick looks down at his underwear. Then SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Ooh! Blaring employee laughter in the common area? [SpongeBob joins in the laughter with Squidward and Mr. Krabs] Hey, Patrick, what's with the fancy duds?
Patrick: Must I explain everything? I found what I want to do with my life! I am Patrick-Man!
SpongeBob: [gasps in amazement] That is so exciting! I can't wait to tell Gary, my parents, grandpar- [Before he can finish, Patrick quickly covers his mouth]
Patrick: Shush, SpongeBob! My identity must be kept secret! My work here is done. Patrick-Man is off! The city needs my help! [He runs off, but then comes back and holds up a dollar] Oh, I almost forgot, can I get a Krabby Patty?
[bubble transition to high school. We then see three fish coming in the locker room looking at their exams.]
Fish 1: Hey, howdya do on your final?
Fish 2: [showing his paper] I aced it.
Fish 1: [showing his paper] Me, too.
[Two fish laugh while Patrick spies on them from behind a corner]
Fish 2: Looks like all the studying paid off.
Fish teenagers: High five! [They raise their hands to a high five. Patrick gasps at this and runs in between the two teenagers. They hit their hands between the sides of Patrick's head]
Fish 2: Whoa, you okay. man?
Patrick: Just remember this: Violence solves nothing!
Fish 2: Violence? But we were just giving high fiv--.
Patrick: No time for silly-talk, citizen. Patrick-Man is needed elsewhere! [He runs off leaving the two fish teenagers to look at each other in confusion]
[bubble transition to a street corner. Mr. Krabs and Mabel are standing in front of a street]
Mr. Krabs: Please, ma'am, allow me. [Mr. Krabs grabs Mabel's bag that is in-between them]
Mabel: Huh? [Turns her neck, but uses her hands instead] Why, thank you, young man. [Street sign switches from "don't walk" to "amble"]
Mr. Krabs: Hehehehe, not a problem, ma'am. It's the least I can doooooo! [Mr. Krabs spots a dollar on the street. The dollar is carried away by the wind] Sorry, lady, you're on your own. [Street sign switches from “amble” to “scamper”]
Mabel: Oh, dear. [Sign goes from scamper back to don't walk] [Cars trap Mabel] Oh, dear!
[The dollar that was blown away is placed on the sidewalk. Mr. Krabs skids up to claim it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sweet dollar. Oh, just look at you. So clean. So crisp. Now come to Krabsy. [Mr. Krabs tries to seize the dollar, but is hand chopped by Patrick-Man.]
Patrick: Halt! Patrick-Man is on to you! Thief! Stealing is bad! Bad!
Mr. Krabs: But I found that dollar!
Patrick: Nah, enough! This dollar shall stay on the sidewalk, where it belongs. [Places dollar back on sidewalk] With Neptune's swiftness, away! [Attempts to fly, but is pushed down by gravity. He then walks with his face on the floor]
Mabel: [walks up to the sidewalk] Hey, a dollar! [Picks up the dollar and gasps. She proceeds to put the dollar in her shirt] This must be my lucky day.
[Scene fades to Flipper's Donuts and shifts over to Patrick eating a donut in the garbage container at the back. A distant call for help is heard]
Patrick: Sounds like another job for Patrick-Man! [Licks the doughnut glaze off his mouth] I'll finish you off later, day-old donuts. Right now, I must move rapidly and act heroically! [Patrick walks to the source of the call at Mrs. Puff's Boating School] What's this? [Mrs. Puff is shown trying to open the door of a boat with her student, Nat, trapped inside] Don't move, and freeze!
Mrs. Puff: Huh? [Patrick-Man throws a net around Mrs. Puff.]
Patrick: Let's see you try to bust outta that, boat thief!
Mrs. Puff: Boat thief? Heavens, no! My poor student is trapped inside this boat! The doors are jammed!
Patrick: Jammed doors, huh? [Writes a note and attaches it on Mrs. Puff] A likely story. With Neptune's swiftness, [Patrick-Man yet again attempts to fly, but is again pushed down by gravity] away! [He walks away with his body down again. A police van shows up shortly after]
Mrs. Puff: Ah, merciful Neptune! The authorities are here. You'll be out of there in no time.
Officer John Slugfish: Well, what do we have here? [Plucks note off and reads it. The note says: "Kops!! this iz Bote Theef -Patrick-Man"] Looks like Patrick-Man caught another one! [With Police Officer 2 next to him, they both take off their hats] What would we do without superheroes? [Mrs. Puff is thrown into the van]
Mrs. Puff: But, I didn't do anything!
Officer John Slugfish: Grand Theft Vessel is a felony. You remember what a felony is, don't you, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: Felony?! Yes, I...! Oh, ugh. Patrick-Man... [Police Van drives away]
Nat: Help?
[bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Order up! Another Krabby Patty for the gentleman.
Harold Reginald: Thank you. Let's hope Patrick-Man doesn't confiscate this one.
Tina: Yeah! He drank my shake, too! Said it was part of an evil plot.
SpongeBob: Eh, sorry, ma'am. I'll get you another. Patrick has taken things too far. [Patrick is on his body on the kitchen floor]
Patrick: Hey, that's Patrick-Man to you. [Patrick gets up, revealing several wood pieces and burns on his body from sliding on the floor]
SpongeBob: What're you doing out there?
Patrick: Something a non-hero civilian would never understand. [Plucks a wood spike out of his body and screams in pain] I'm about to unmask one of Bikini Bottom's biggest foes! Right here in the Krusty Krab. And I've intercepted his evil schemes! [Shows SpongeBob a card order of a recipe for coral bits]
SpongeBob: You've intercepted a recipe for toasted coral bits. Don't you think you're going a little overboard with this Patrick-Man thing?
Patrick: Overboaaard?! You call this overboard?! Away with Neptune's [Tries to jump through order window, but gets stuck] Swiftness! [Tries to pull himself through, but his fat body is wedged tight in the window] Villains and criminals, beware! [Keeps trying to pull himself free from the window] Patrick-Man is here! [Patrick pops out of the window, launches into Squidward and is sent flying past Mabel sitting at a table]
Mabel: Good gracious. [Turns neck again with hands]
Patrick: And he always finds out who hides under the mask! [Goes up to blue Fred and attempts to rip his face off]
Fred: Hey, man, I'd like to hold onto my face, thank you!
Patrick: Oh, right. [Walks up to two fish, male and female, and tries to rip their faces off] Gotcha!
Male Fish: Yeouch! Let's get out of here and never come back. [Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office and suddenly gets a super-stretched neck]
Mr. Krabs: Whaaaaaaaat?[Patrick tries to rip another fish's face off] Alright, that does it!
Patrick: Admit it, masked marauder!
Mr. Krabs: Enough! [Pulls Patrick and carries him away] We've all had our fill of Patrick-Man!
Patrick: But I was about to unmask a supervillain!
Mr. Krabs: Sure you were. [Patrick grabs Mabel's head] What the barnacles are you doing?
Patrick: Protecting Bikini Bottom from a scoundrel!
Mabel: Ohh, dear!
SpongeBob: Let her go, Patrick!
Patrick: No way! [Patrick rips off Mabel's head, which is actually a mask. SpongeBob gasps. The Dirty Bubble emerges from the clothes of Mabel and laughs maniacally] Hey! Where'd he come from?
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Dirty Bubble?!
Patrick: The Dirty Bubble? I wanted to unmask Man Ray.
Dirty Bubble: Fools, you blew my cover! Now taste my wrath!
SpongeBob: What now, Patrick?
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're looking at a superhero. So naturally, I will rely on my superpowers, [Picks up a barrel] and throw some stuff! [Patrick throws the barrel and hits Squidward]
Dirty Bubble: [laughs] I wouldn't call that a total miss. [Patrick has a table in his hand]
Patrick: Take this, beast! [Throws table, along with another barrel, but both miss. The table hits the cashier boat and the barrel hits the glass wall of the Krusty Krab and shatters it. Patrick grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Wha, no, Patrick! [Patrick throws him]
Dirty Bubble: Haha, yummy sponge.
Mr. Krabs: You've disabled my employees and trashed me restaurant?! Think you might go for the Bubble now?
Patrick: I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch! [Stench from Patrick's armpit forms a pit and flies toward the Dirty Bubble. The Dirty Bubble swallows it and it hits SpongeBob]
Dirty Bubble: Ha! Let's try that again, but this time, I attack! [Dirty Bubble is flying towards Patrick. Patrick gets scared. He looks down and sees an dirty Krabby Patty and picks it up]
Patrick: Lunch! [Patrick's ice cream cone point pops the charging Dirty Bubble, defeating him. The fish hiding behind the tables cheer in approval and Patrick eats the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Way to go, buddy! You're a hero! Uh, may I have your autograph?
Patrick: Why, of course, young man. That's, uh, SpongeBob with two 7s, right?
SpongeBob: What's your next exciting adventure, Patrick-Man?
Patrick: Actually, [takes off the cone on his head] it's Patrick to you. [Eats cone] I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work.
Mr. Krabs: Not so fast! I think I need you to use your superpowers one last time. [Hands Patrick a broom and a dust pan. Scene zooms out and shows the Krusty Krab with broken furniture everywhere]
Patrick: What's this?


[The episode starts with Squidward listening to the radio.]
Narrator: [shown in Squidward’s bathroom] Feel droplets gently cascade over your body.
Squidward: [in the bathtub] Oh yeah...
Narrator: Visualize yourself in a private grotto. [Squidward visualizes himself in a resort-like tub] Focus your perceptions on the native fauna, and the soothing nature of their rustic calls. [a scallop laughs like Patrick]
Squidward: Huh?
Narrator: You are one with nature.
Squidward: Ahh... [scallops laugh like SpongeBob and Patrick, Squidward's fantasy sequence ends] What the—!? [SpongeBob and Patrick giggle, Squidward goes to the window] Barnacles!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with baby toys]
Patrick: How do you like that, baby?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, yeah. Well, what do ya think about this, baby? [SpongeBob and Patrick laughs]
Squidward: Question. Are you two acting even more infantile than usual this morning?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. ‘Cause I found a box of my old baby toys in the attic, and we're playing with them. [Squidward pulls down blinds] Hey! My old teddy walrus! This stuff really takes  me back. [hugs teddy walrus]
Patrick: [sucks on pacifier] Yeah. it makes me feel baby-ish. Oh, Look at me I'm a baby. [sucks on thumb]
SpongeBob: [giggles] Babies don't talk like that, Patrick. They talk like... [SpongeBob and Patrick start talking baby talk. SpongeBob plays xylophone. Patrick plays with ring toss. SpongeBob plays with mallet and whistle. Patrick still plays with ring toss. SpongeBob and Patrick are both playing with baby toys. Squidward gets angry and walks out of his house naked]
Squidward: Just as the essential oils were kicking in. [SpongeBob and Patrick play on a scooter] Hey! I'd appreciate some quiet! [SpongeBob and Patrick scoot away] How dare you scoot away from me, I'm scolding here! [SpongeBob and Patrick play with a Jack-in-the-Box] Would you two for once, act your age?! [Head from Jack-in-the-Box pops out; SpongeBob and Patrick cry] Fine! Act like infants your whole life! See if I care. I'm returning to my grown up lifestyle. So keep it down! [slips on a toy boatmobile, gets his head stuck in a scooter and crashes into his mailbox]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! [Squidward's head swells up]
Patrick: Hey, he's mumblin' and droolin' like a little baby.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know, Patrick. He isn't looking so good. He should probably see a doctor. Come on, let's take him to the hospital.
Patrick: Hang in there, buddy. We'll have you fixed up in no time. [SpongeBob and Patrick carry Squidward to the hospital]
Purple Doctorfish: Hmmm?
SpongeBob: So what's the prognosis, doctor?
Purple Doctorfish: Your friend has a condition known by the medical term of Head-go-boom-boom-itis. Not to worry, though, he should recover over normally over time, but he mustn't receive any more blows to the head or he may remain this way permanently. Just care for him as if he were your very own bouncy baby boy and he'll be fine. [cuts to SpongeBob's house]
Patrick: Hey, little Squidward. Ready to have some fun? Woop-ee-doo! [throws Squidward up to ceiling]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squiddy! Din din is ready. Where is our little miracle? [shows Squidward stuck in ceiling] Patrick, how could you! [climbs up Patrick and pulls Squidward out of ceiling] There, there! My little darling. We're supposed to protect his head, remember? [crashes top of high chair to Squidward's face] Okay, Squiddy! I made your favorite. Krill tartare with an algae vinaigrette. [puts food on Squidward's high chair] Here it comes, open wide! [Squidward rejects food] Come on, little buddy, you got eat healthy so you can grow up to be big and cranky. Just watch the airplane land in the hangar. [imitates airplane engine and sticks the spoon in Squidward's mouth] See, Patrick, sometimes you have to out-think the baby. [Squidward spits food at SpongeBob and throws plate] You know, Patrick, maybe we...
Patrick: [licks food off SpongeBob] Ahh, thanks for sharing, baby
SpongeBob: Okay. Time to lighten things up. Do you like games, Squiddy?
Patrick: Games? Games is our middle name!
[SpongeBob and Patrick play Kelpy Cake. Squidward claps]
SpongeBob: You like that, Squiddy?
Patrick: He does. [SpongeBob and Patrick try to get Squidward to play Kelpy Cake. Squidward slaps SpongeBob and Patrick and throws them up]
SpongeBob: Ohh, this game's kinda dangerous. [Squidward crawls out door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squiddy! [a truck goes towards Squidward and truck driver falls asleep] Squiddy. No!
Patrick: Don't worry. I got this. [lifts a pavement and truck flies away. He then sets down the pavement, and a fanfare plays]
SpongeBob: Hooray! [sees road landed on Squiddy’s head, gasps] Squidward! [Patrick lifts up the pavement] Squiddy, are you okay? [grabs Squidward. Patrick sets down the pavement] We need to do a better job of protecting him. [the truck crashes into Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick put Squidward in a cage, and he cries]
SpongeBob: There, there now, no need to cry. [puts Squidward out of cage and tries to calm him down]
Patrick: Don't worry, he'll be settled down in couple of minutes. [He watches TV while SpongeBob carries Squidward, crying, SpongeBob goes to bed while he holds Squidward crying, SpongeBob takes a bath while Patrick holds him, then vice versa, SpongeBob holds him crying while Patrick puts on earplugs, then noise-canceling headphones. They eat while Squidward cries, Squidward eats and spits food out on them while crying, both of them are tired while Squidward is crying.]
Narrator: 72 hours later.
Mr. Krabs: It's one minute till opening. Where the barnacles are me employerees? I don't pay them to be late. [SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward appear, lightning flashes]
Patrick: Taking care of a baby sure is hard.
SpongeBob: You said it! I'm exhausted! Hey, Patrick. I have to go to work. Would you mind holding Squidw.... [Patrick falls asleep] I guess it's just you and me, little fella.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, Squidward, enough duff-dragging! Get to your stations, pronto!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Squidward is in no condition to perform his Krusty duties. [turns around to show Mr. Krabs that Squidward is a baby. Squidward makes baby noises] The poor guy has the mind of an infant.
Mr. Krabs: I don't care if he has seaweed-for-brains. He needs to be behind that register. We've got customers out there just begging to hand me their money. [shows customers outside begging to come in with their money]
SpongeBob: But...
Mr. Krabs: No buts! Get to work, you two!
SpongeBob: [slams into the table and Squidward flies into his work station] All settled into your work station, I see. Maybe you're ready for your Krusty duties after all! Now let's make it official! [hands Squidward a hat, which he rejects] Oh, how silly of me! [grabs a high chair and picks up Squidward] Squiddy needs a high chair! [puts the high chair near the register and puts Squidward in it. Squidward bangs his head on the cash register] And duct tape! [duct-tapes Squidward to the chair and puts his hat on] Oh, Squiddy! I'm so proud of you! Just yesterday, you were drooling all over me! And look at you now, working and sitting in a big boy seat! [SpongeBob's eyes get full of tears]
Mr. Krabs: All right! That's enough, you two. Time to serve some customers! [customers race in to order]
SpongeBob: Remember, buddy! I'll be right behind you!
Billy: Can I get a Krabby Patty and a large kelp shake, please? [Squidward makes baby noises and hits his head with a rattle] Okay, how much do I owe ya? [Squidward drools, laughs and sucks on Billy's hand]
SpongeBob: [peeks his head out the kitchen window] Squidward! That's not for eating! [takes a napkin and polishes Billy's hand] There we are. Good as neww-! [Squidward sucks on Billy's head] That's not for eating either! [takes Squidward off Billy's head] Sorry, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Hop to it, boys. We haven't even taken our first order!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs. [hands Squidward a pencil and pad of paper] You know what to do. [Squidward grabs the pencil and paper and laughs, throwing the papers into the kitchen] Thanks, Squiddy. I can also count on, huh... [notices that Squidward doodled on the pieces of paper] Will this be for here or to go? [peeks out the kitchen window, where Squidward is laughing and tossing the papers around] We have to work on your penmanship, Squiddy. [Squidward laughs and doodles on Nat's face]
Nat: My face! My face! Also my leg, but mostly my face!
Pilar: Hey! Are you going to take an order or what? [Squidward opens the register, hits his head and cries]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Yelling at a poor, defenseless baby! You oughta be ashamed!
Pilar: Listen, man! I'm done playing these baby games! [notices the stench of Squidward's rotten diaper] Oh, my Neptune! [Squidward continues to cry and notices his stinky diaper]
Customers: What is that? What is it?
Mr. Krabs: What in blazes is going on around he...... Whoa! Mr. Squidward! [Squidward bangs his head] Where are your manners?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, watch his head!
Mr. Krabs: Watch his head? Why don't you watch his diaper? [SpongeBob notices Squidward's stinky diaper] And get it changed!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! Yes, sir! [goes to a table to change the diaper, where customers are eating] Oh.
Fred: We're eating here!
SpongeBob: Sorry! [tries to change Squidward on the floor]
Customer: Hey, I'm trying to walk here!
SpongeBob: Sorry! [tries to change Squidward near the condiments]
Suzy Fish: [notices the dirty diaper and is disgusted] Hey, I was gonna get ketchup there!
SpongeBob: Sorry! [takes Squidward to the cash register to change him] Okay, Squiddy! Hold still! And, oh, boy!
Mr. Krabs: Are you out of your ever-living mind?! We can't change that baby out here in front of the customers! Take him in back where the food is prepared. [customers get disgusted and leave] Oh, that's it! Get that poopy baby out of me restaurant!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if my poopy baby isn't welcome here, then I'm not staying either! [slips on Squidward's baby rattle and ends up in the kitchen, where he bangs Squidward's head on the frying pans and ice machine. Ice ends up on Squidward's head. SpongeBob gasps] Squidward! [Squidward turns back to normal]
Squidward: What the? Where am I? What's going on?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you're back to your normal grown-up self.
Squidward: Of course I'm grown-up! Why wouldn't I be? [notices he's wearing a diaper] Am I wearing a diaper?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Squidward: Is it full? [looks inside diaper and screams]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I was gonna change it, but I got in the wra... [Squidward puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth]
Squidward: Stop! Not another word about this. Ever!
SpongeBob: Kids, they grow up so fast.


Squidward: [At register] Ah, yes, just how I like it... nice and empty. [looks around at the empty restaurant]
Old Man Walker: [Sitting at a table] Hey, I'm still here. [Waves]
Squidward: Oh, yes, sirree—nice and empty. [Looks around then sits down at the register. Presses a button revealing a slot with a pillow. Pulls down a picture of an island and turns on a fan. Drinks a drink and is relaxed]
Jimmy: Do you work here? [looking over register]
Squidward: [Spits his drink. Sighs] Welcome to the Krusty-- Wha-What the! [Sees the large line of people and gasps] Well, there goes my nap. Multiple orders up! Sponge... Bob! SpongeBob! Where are you?! You need to get out here and make those Krabby Patties. [Looking for SpongeBob in the kitchen. SpongeBob starts laughing from inside a barrel. Squidward looks through the barrel hole. SpongeBob is writing in a book. Squidward grumbles and sticks a megaphone into the hole] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes out of the megaphone like liquid] Get it together, SpongeBob. The dining room is full of ravenous customers. [Customers making monkey noises, chewing on things, and swinging from ropes]
SpongeBob: [In liquid form, goes to the storage freezer and comes back out with a stack of patties] I got it. [Spins like a tornado throwing the patties onto the grill. Presses button on spatula twice that makes it fold out to have triple length. Flips three patties and whistles]
Squidward: Hmm, what was that imbecile doing in there? [Looking at the barrel. Pulls out book] An old book?
SpongeBob: [Looks back scared] Nothing.
[Takes book from Squidward and places it between the fryers]
Squidward: What's going on here?
[SpongeBob gets all the patties into a stack and puts ingredients inside of himself. Jumps out to the dining area where he jumps onto the ceiling and shoots out Krabby Patties to the customers]
Customers: Thank you! [Waving at SpongeBob. They take bites and give thumbs up to each other. SpongeBob continues to shoot out Krabby Patties. Customers clap once again]
Old Man Walker: Excuse me. I wanted pickles on mine. [SpongeBob taps his head twice, shooting pickles onto Krabby Patty]
[Squidward looks out from the kitchen to the main area of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Hmmm. [Picks up book from between the fryers] If SpongeBrain is keeping the book away from me, then I have no choice but to read it. [SpongeBob walks into kitchen]
SpongeBob: I'll take that, thank you. [Takes book]
[SpongeBob is sitting on top of a barrel writing in the diary]
Squidward: [Looking through the kitchen window with his nose hanging over] There he goes again, scribbling away in that little book. [Turns back around] I must admit, my curiosity is peaked... I guess I'm "peaked" to "peek" at that book. [Laughs as a rimshot is heard. Sighs] Oh, puns. [Wipes away tears from laughing]
Old Man Walker: [Sitting at a table] Ha.
Squidward: [Holding brown bag] Hey, SpongeBob, you need to make a delivery.
SpongeBob: [Closes diary, sets it down, and turns towards Squidward] Okie-dokie!
Squidward: The address is on the bag.
SpongeBob: I got it. [Walks out of kitchen]
Squidward: [Whistles and walks to the diary. Picks up the diary and gasps] It's a diary! Oh-ho-ho. This is gonna be good. Huh? Drat, it's locked. [Tries to pry lock open] Hmm. I need a hairpin. [Mr. Krabs is in his office writing on paper. Squidward reaches behind him and pulls out a hairpin. Mr. Krabs' hair puffs out into an afro. Squidward unlocks the lock with the pin, opens the diary, watching it glow and a heavenly choir singing] And now... the diary of a moron. [Reading diary]
SpongeBob: "Dear diary, what an amazing day I've..." [Fades into SpongeBob narrating he story] ...day I've had. [Phone ringing] This morning I was greeted by my nearest and dearest neighbor, Squidward. [Answers phone] He had some very important news he was just bursting to share. [Phone growls at SpongeBob. Walks to Squidward's house] He had decided that today would be the perfect day to deliver his profound opinions on how to properly raise and care for a household pet. [Knocks on the door. Squidward answers and holds Gary angrily. Gary is chewing. Squidward shoves Gary to SpongeBob] Specifically, what not to feed them. [Squidward holds up a record album that reads "Sole Jazz" and throws it at SpongeBob] The list was very thorough. [Squidward holds up a torn shirt on hanger, then a picture of his mother with a bite taken out of it] Needless to say, this is all very enlightening. [Squidward throws picture on ground and jumps on it] It warms my heart to know that Squidward thinks we're close enough to use the harshest words in his critique-- [Squidward yelling in SpongeBob's face] Horrible words that should never be used around strangers, who may now know how well-intentioned those words are. [Squidward points and pokes SpongeBob angrily] Knowing I have a tendency to dawdle, Gary cut our conversation short. [Gary bites Squidward's hand. Squidward punts SpongeBob] And I was hurried along to work, where I arrived only a hour and a half early for what may be my favorite day of the year, [SpongeBob lands at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs unlocks the front door] cleaning day! [SpongeBob mopping, Mr. Krabs reading the paper] Together, Mr. Krabs and I scrubbed every inch of the Krusty Krab, [SpongeBob scrubbing floor] and finally, with a little elbow grease, we were able to get into even the tightest spots. [Mr. Krabs using SpongeBob as chimney sweep] Ah yes, cleaning day. [Narration ends]
Squidward: Great Neptune, I had no idea. The depth of his delusion is awe inspiring.
SpongeBob: [Knocks on door] Well, I don't know. Something about this delivery address doesn't seem right. [SpongeBob is at a dumpster. Gasps] Wait a minute. Squidward! He must have been the victim of a prank phone call. Poor Squidward. He can be so gullible. [SpongeBob sets the delivery in the dumpster]
Patrick: [Comes up from inside the dumpster] Oh, boy! [Looks in bag] A ketchup packet! That'll go great on this old diaper. [Holds up ketchup and diaper]
SpongeBob: [Back at the Krusty Krab. Chuckles] Oh, Squidward! You are gonna laugh when you hear what I've... been. [Squidward crouches down to hide] Squidward? Where are you? Could have sworn I just saw him.
Squidward: [nervously sweating] SpongeBob, uh, one of the customers dropped his watch in a toilet, and I need you to fish it out. [Holds up plunger and hanger]
SpongeBob: [Takes hanger and plunger] Duty calls.
[Squidward takes diary out from inside his hat. Opens it, turns the page, and laughs. His laugh turns into a cough as he sees a large customer at the register]
Customer #2: You laughing at me?
Squidward: What? Oh, no. No, no, no. I was just reading what SpongeBob wrote in his diary. It's hilarious.
Customer #2: Reading somebody else's diary—that's terrible! Tell me more!
Squidward: It says here, when SpongeBob sees plaid, he has the uncontrollable urge to cluck like a chicken. [Both laugh]
Mr. Krabs: [Now at the register] Did somebody say plaid? Why I'm a plaid enthusiast. [Wearing kilt] I just got me new kilt today.
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob. Can you come here, please?
SpongeBob: [Walks out of the restroom with  a tire, umbrella, guitar, anchor, and Old Man Walker] I couldn't find that watch anywhere. All I found was this stuff--
Old Man Walker: I fell in.
SpongeBob: And that guy.
Squidward: What do you think of Mr. Krabs' new plaid kilt?
SpongeBob: P-p-p-p-plaid? [SpongeBob's face doubles with 2 mouths. He throws everything out of his hands]
Old Man Walker: Hey! [SpongeBob starts clucking like a chicken and crows like a rooster]
Mr. Krabs: Well, you don't have to be nasty about it!
[Squidward and Customer #2 laugh. SpongeBob is still clucking]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob slaps himself] Avert your eyes, SquarePants. [Covers eyes] I have to take my break! [Runs through the kitchen out the back. Pulls out bubble soap and blows bubbles. Sighs]
Squidward: [Reading to customers] Listen to this — SpongeBob has named his spatula "Fifi."
[Customers all laugh]
Henry-Bart: He named his spatula "Fifi."
Nat: He named his spatula "Fifi." [Telling customers behind him. Customers laugh] What kind of name is Fifi?
Patrick: [Laughing loudly] Who ever heard of naming a spatula Fifi? It's a girl's name! Right, Frank? [Holds up his own spatula]
SpongeBob: [Walks out of the kitchen holding spatula] I'm back from my break. Any orders, Squidward?
Patrick: Yeah, cook me up a Krabby Patty... with good old Fifi.
SpongeBob: [Gasps] Oh, sure thing. [Runs to kitchen] Fifi, how did Patrick know your name? Have you been talking?
Squidward: Oh, oh, this is the best one yet. Get this: "If I hear the Bikini Bottom Municipal Anthem, I can't help but take off all my clothes and dance around in my underwear!" [Everyone laughs] Quiet, quiet, quiet. Watch this. [Pulls out radio and plays the anthem] [SpongeBob calmly throws spatula and takes off clothes wearing only his underwear. He dances around. Everyone laughs and the music stops. SpongeBob looks over at Squidward]
SpongeBob: My... Diary! Squidward! How could you?! [Cries and runs into the dining area with everyone laughing at him. Runs into Mr. Krabs, clucks like a chicken again, continues crying, and runs out the door]
Nat: That was that little dude's diary? [Door slams]
Customers: [Overlapping murmuring] That is not okay. That was uncool.
Mr. Krabs: That's low, Squidward... even for you. You'd better apologize.
Squidward: [Scoffs] He'll get over it.
[SpongeBob is crying outside of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is scatting and humming. He pulls out an umbrella as he walks by SpongeBob crying]
Newspaper Boy: Extra, extra, read all about it! Jerk reads the diary, local fry cook devastated. [Holding up newspaper]
Squidward: Oh, boy, let me see one of those papers. Uh-huh, mm-hm. [Cover of paper shows a sad photo of SpongeBob. Squidward laughs and tosses the paper on the ground. Citizens stare at him] Taxi! [Waving, a taxi car with the model of the boat screeches its tires, approaching him]
Driver: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it, pal. You're that diary reader.
Squidward: Yes, I am. [Driving away in an angry attitude after hearing tires squeal, Squidward coughs in the exhaust. Then he continues walking]
Abigail-Marge: Diary thief!
Sandals: Jerk!
John: Secret stealer!
Sadie: Billy, stay away from that mean, old diary reader.
Squidward: Morons. [At his front door]
Quincy: Squidward Tentacles, by reading another person's diary, you have violated the terms of your loan. [Holds up loan papers] We are repossessing your house.
Squidward: [coughs] What?
Quincy: Take it away, boys! [Squidward’s house is lifted away with a crane. Thunder crashes and it starts to rain. Squidward puts up his umbrella and gets hit by lightning]
Squidward: Ow! [Squidward now laying on a bench with newspapers over his body. The papers blow away]
Officer Nancy: [Taps Squidward on the head with a club with her partner, Officer John] Hey, you can't sleep here, fella. [Horn honks] Wait a second, you're that diary reader! I had a diary once. My brother read it! I had a brother once! Come on, fella! We have a special place for people like you!
[Squidward is locked in a pillory]
Patrick: Diary reader! [He throws a tomato at Squidward]
Squidward: What!? You read it, too!
Patrick: Oh, sure, blame everyone but yourself. Oh, that is so you. [Throws tomato at Squidward and walks away. Squidward grunts]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. How's it going?
Squidward: SpongeBob, oh, thank goodness. You have to forgive me.
SpongeBob: What for?
Squidward: For reading your diary.
SpongeBob: Oh, that. You know, Squidward, everyone was so amused by it, I had it published. It's a best seller, and I owe it all to you. [Holds up book titled "SpongeBob's Diary"] Besides, you only read my work diary. You've never even seen my secret personal diary. [Holds up a diary titled "My Secret Personal Diary" with a unicorn, smiley face, heart, and rainbow on the cover] Now, that would have been really embarrassing.
Nat: There he is! That diary reader! [Group of fish holding tomatoes show up] Let's get him!
Crowd: Yeah! [Shouting angrily at Squidward]
SpongeBob: People, people. Stop your assault. Through my art, as an author, I have forgiven Squidward.
Nat: Oh yeah, did you know he's reading your personal diary? [Squidward laughs while holding reading the diary]
SpongeBob: Squidward! How could you?!
[SpongeBob bursts into tears, then runs away once again. After SpongeBob runs away, the crowd throws tomatoes at Squidward yelling at him]
Squidward: I don't care. This is so worth it! [Squidward laughs]


[This episode opens up with Frankie Billy taking his driving test at Mrs. Puff's Boating School.]
Frankie Billy: Once around the roundabout. [clears the roundabout] Left at the wall. [clears the brick wall] Over the Bump of Truth. [clears the bump] And finally, the flaming hoop! [clears the hoop, then crosses the finish line. He then obtains his passing grade from Mrs. Puff.] Thank you, Mrs. Puff, I am now a car daring figure and a producing member of society. [excitedly cheers] Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Mrs. Puff: [proudly] Oh, nothing brings me more joy than teaching. I can't wait to pass my next student.
SpongeBob: [enters car excitingly] Hello, Mrs. Puff. I'm all set for my driving test. [Mrs. Puff shatters to pieces on the car floor] Mrs. Puff, you okay?
Mrs. Puff: [pulls herself back together] Just start driving. [SpongeBob accidentally floors it in reverse] Turn this boat around immediately!
SpongeBob: Right away, ma’am. [SpongeBob turns the wheel but goes around in circles knocking out all the traffic cones] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I have this under control... [accidentally pulls off the wheel, crashing into the lighthouse and the wall, tying the bump in a knot, and crashing through the ramp and the flaming hoop]
[setting switches to a house where two teenage fish are watching Goin' Bananas 3 in 3D on the television]
Announcer: Next up, Goin' Bananas 3: In 3D.
Teenage Fish #1: Hey, dude, pass the 3D glasses. This is supposed to be, like, in 3D.   
Teenage Fish #2:: Oh, yeah, right! [gets the two 3-D glasses. On the TV a fancy-looking driver appears]
Driver: Here I am! I'm coming at ya like your worst nightmare! [laughs]
[SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff crash through the wall of the house, thereby wrecking the TV]
Teenage Fish #1 and #2: [chuckling] Wow!
Mrs. Puff: I think it's safe to say you have once again, failed your driving test!
SpongeBob: [teenage fish laugh] Uh, but, Mrs, Puff, I-
Mrs. Puff: No buts, SpongeBob! You fail this test over and over! I'm beginning to think you are simply... unteachable! [teenage fish laugh again] Now, get out of my sight!
[SpongeBob shakes and begins to look upset]
SpongeBob: I...I... [starts to cry] I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff!
[SpongeBob runs off crying. Mrs. Puff is growling]
Teenage Fish: Dude, this is, like, the gnarliest 3-D movie ever!
[Mrs. Puff puffs from her anger and accidentally falls over on the teenage fish. Despite being crushed, the teenage fish still laugh about it.]
[Transition to Mrs. Puff's house where she attempts to relax. For comedic effect, the photo on the wall depicts the same scene here, in a similar way to No Free Rides.]
Mrs. Puff: If only SpongeBob could pass his boating test, he'd be out of my life once and for all. Unfortunately, I keep getting reminded of the consequences if I get too angry with the little nuisance. [shows a handcuff locked on her leg. It is beeping with a red light flashing on it] I can't even leave town without violating my parole. [groans] If there was only some way that I didn't have to live in fear. [Suddenly, Mrs. Puff gets an idea] Fear! That's the answer! SpongeBob is afraid of the driving course! So it would stand to reason that if he took the driving test somewhere else besides the driving course, he would pass! [goes outside to see cars drive by her house on the road] Of course! The answer's been in front of me all along! I'll test SpongeBob on a real road and then he'll be out of my life forever! [laughs] Yeah! What could possibly go wrong?
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob's house with all of the lights turned off. SpongeBob is tired and depressed.]
[Gary appears and meows for food]
SpongeBob: Not now, Gary. Can't you see I'm wallowing in my own filth? [groans. Suddenly, his door knocks] Come back later; I'm wallowing. [door knocks again. SpongeBob decides to get up and answer it. He opens the door to surprisingly see Mrs. Puff at his door]
Mrs. Puff: Good morning, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:  [gasps and runs away]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob? SpongeBob? [SpongeBob coughs. He is inside the TV] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff. I am trying to stay out of your sight.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, that! Let's forget what I said. It's time to take a fresh approach.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I...You said...Don't you remember? I'm un- [Mrs. Puff turns the TV on "Mute"] [Note: It's believed that he said "I'm unteachable."]
Mrs. Puff: We don't have time for this, SpongeBob. We have a long day of driving ahead of us.
[Bubble transition over to the desert. Mrs. Puff is driving. SpongeBob sees two clams cawing]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, why have you taken me to this weathery moat and slightly scary landscape?
Mrs. Puff: To overcome your fears, silly.
[They pass a skeleton pointing left and it falls apart]
SpongeBob: It's not working!
Mrs. Puff: Here we are!
SpongeBob: Uh, where are we?
Mrs. Puff: This old abandoned road is the perfect venue for your driving test.
SpongeBob: Dr-iving test?!
Mrs. Puff: That's right! You're free from all the distracting obstacles on the boating course. [she stops the boat] Out here, there's nothing but the road. [gets out of the boat] Now, scooch over. [SpongeBob doesn't] Come on. Scooch over. [lifts up the seat and wiggles it until SpongeBob is behind the wheel]
SpongeBob: [buckling his seatbelt] But Mrs. Puff, what about the fact that I'm unteachable?
Mrs. Puff: Forget all about that. Out here, you can teach a hermit crab to boat.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I'm still intimidated!
Mrs. Puff: Listen. If you're nervous about boating, simply repeat the words: "Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road." Got it?
SpongeBob: O-o-okay. [takes the wheel] Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. [gulp] Uh, focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. [presses gas pedal, covers eyes] Focus on the road. [uncovers eyes] There is nothing but the road. Hey, look at me. I'm not crashing and stuff.
Mrs. Puff: Wonderful! Keep that up and I'll have no choice but to pass you! Just repeat your mantra.
SpongeBob: Focus on the road, the open unintimidating road.
[as he says this, they ride on a curved road]
Mrs. Puff: Boating within the lines. [checks said rule off her list] Well done.
SpongeBob: Focus on the road. [activates turn signal, boat turns left] There is nothing but the road.
Mrs. Puff: Finally using your turn signal, woohoo! [checks off "uses turn signals] Check.
SpongeBob: Focus on the road. [drives the boat on a circular road] There is nothing but the road.
Mrs. Puff: Roundabout navigation, check!
SpongeBob: Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road! [presses gas pedal slightly harder, speeding the boat up]
Mrs. Puff: Safe and steady acceleration, check! [checks off said rule]
SpongeBob: Focus on the road... [drives the boat up a mountain] There is nothing but the road. [drives the boat through snow on top of the mountain and drives down it back to the road]
[Mrs. Puff checks off "Vertical driving". SpongeBob continues repeating the mantra several times. He drives the boat over loopy roads and even under the road as well. He also makes the boat jump a gap, and even ducks under a garbage truck. A psychedelic moment of his driving begins: First, he drives on what looks like a mobius strip. Then he drives over a road with another SpongeBob under it. Then, he drives up a curvy road with a SpongeBob like face, which swallows the boat. The camera pans upward to a Saturn-like planet, and SpongeBob jumps out of the planet and drives along its ringlike road. The rings break and SpongeBob flies into the screen, acting like he's in a trance. The same goes with the boat driving into the screen, SpongeBob's head is at the bow. The boat drives around the inside of another SpongeBob, while at a real-life road. Finally, a skull rises, SpongeBob's mouth is in its eye sockets. Its road-tongue rolls out, and SpongeBob skates out, wearing boats as rollerskates. He jumps off, spins, and falls. Cut back to Mrs. Puff in reality]
Mrs. Puff: Check...check...and...CHECK! [pants] What is this?! [pants]
[camera zooms to the only rule not checked off on Mrs. Puff's list: "Safely dock vessel"]
Mrs. Puff: Only one more test, and it's the easiest one yet. SpongeBob, all you have to do is safely dock this vessel.
[camera widens to show SpongeBob, still repeating the mantra. He is sweating and drooling, and his eyes are hypno-like]
SpongeBob: Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. [crashes through a "road closed" sign] Focus... [snaps out] on the...road? What happened to the road!?
Mrs. Puff: Calm down, SpongeBob. Listen: all you have to do is safely stop this vessel!
SpongeBob: Uh...focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!
Mrs. Puff: Just stop the boat!
SpongeBob: Uh, focus on the - uh-uh-uh... [gasp] The road!
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, wait!
[SpongeBob sends the boat airborne; the boat lands on a plain of rocks]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBoooob!
[The boat hits a large rock; the boat lands on a road.]
SpongeBob: That was a close one Mrs. Puff. But I am back on the road and ready to focus upon it.
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob? This isn't just any road. [a truck honks two times] It's a 10-lane Intertial Seaway! [the truck honks again for 2 seconds]
SpongeBob: Shu-ven-tah-dil-in-chi-huh?!
Mrs. Puff: Stay calm, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob splats to the floor] SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! SpongeBob! Remember your mantra? 
SpongeBob: Right. "Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road" [SpongeBob gasps and the truck honks again] I can't even see the road! [SpongeBob shivers]. 
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob! Give me the wheel, SpongeBob. Oh, dear! He's completely frozen up! [Mrs. Puff rips off SpongeBob's hands and drives for him] Fiddlesticks!
[The truck honks longer and the boat passes by a police station]
Police Officer: Reckless drivers. I loathe reckless drivers. [the officer presses a button on the side of his helmet, making sunglasses (goggles) appear over his eyes, as well as a mustache between his nose and mouth, and then drives his motorcycle]
Police Officer: Pull over, you menace! [SpongeBob screams, Mrs. Puff is still driving with SpongeBob's arms]
SpongeBob: Uh, Mrs. Puff, can I have my arms back?
Police Officer: I said, stop your vessel!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Officer sir, I'm applying the brakes! [SpongeBob drives away]
Police Officer: Uh, we got us a runner.
Mrs. Puff: Pull over, SpongeBob... And make it quick. Look! [SpongeBob screams] No!
[Mrs. Puff screams in the tunnel]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, hit the brakes!
SpongeBob: Huh? Oh! Okay! [Car screams to a stop in a parking spot]
Mrs. Puff: Goodness gracious. There isn't a scratch on this vessel. SpongeBob? The test is history! You, you passed! Here's your license! [SpongeBob smiles and sheds a tear] And I'm free! Ha ha! [officer arrives]
Officer: I don't think so.
Mrs. Puff: Is there a problem, officer? [looks at her fin]
Officer: Well, you crossed the county line three miles back. You, ma'am, [puts handcuffs on Mrs. Puff] are a parole violator, which makes this test...null and void. I'll take that. [Officer rips up SpongeBob's license, Mrs. Puff gets thrown into police car]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I'll get you for this! I'll get you!


[The episode opens on a breaking news announcement on the television]
Johnny Elaine: Witnesses are flocking around the unveiling of Bikini Bottom's newest bank: The Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank.
Mayor: [cuts the ribbon] The first one hundred customers who join Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank will receive instant interest on their deposit.
[the view shifts to the Krusty Krab with Mr. Krabs spitting soda at the television screen]
Mr. Krabs: "Instant interest"?! Well, that's practically giving money away! [runs to SpongeBob] SpongeBob! You're in charge while I run down to the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank! I gotta get down there before they run out of dough! [runs very fast out of the Krusty Krab and into the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank] Money, here I co- Oo-oo-oh... [looks around at all of the customers getting their money out and starts speaking gibberish]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Thanks for banking with Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank! [takes out money] And here's your instant interest. [gives the customer money]
[Mr. Krabs continues to speak in gibberish as he watches Pilar throwing bags of into the safe]
Gus: Free moolah, just for joining?! Yes!
Mr. Krabs: I'm in money heaven! [laughs]
Officer John: [talking on a walkie-talkie] Heads up! We got a live one...
Nancy Suzy Fish: Welcome to Bank of Bikini...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, hi! I want to see all of your money!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Excuse me?
Mr. Krabs: Show me where the money lives! I'd bet you got a lot! [Nancy Suzy Fish presses a button] I'd like to see all of it! I'm a huge fan of money! [suddenly gets taken away by Nat Peterson and Officer John] Oh! H-Hey! Get your hands off... [gets kicked out of the Bank by Officer John and flies through the air] [screams and lands on the ground] Anchovies...
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs entering the Bank again but this time, wearing a mustache]
Mr. Krabs: [in a deep voice] Good day, madam! I would like to take a look at your safe, please!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Sure thing, sir... [presses the button again and Mr. Krabs is grabbed by Officer John and Nat again]
Mr. Krabs: Not again... [gets kicked out of the Bank again] [screams and crashes into a cliff] Scallops!
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs entering the Bank again disguised as a woman]
Mr. Krabs: [walks by Officer John and Nat Peterson, speaking in a feminine voice] Good day, gentlemen!
Officer John and Nat Peterson: Good day, ma'am!
Mr. Krabs: [walks up to Nancy Suzy Fish again] Hello, young missy!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Well hello, ma'am. How can we help you today?
Mr. Krabs: [in his thoughts] So far so good...
Nancy Suzy Fish: Ma'am?
Mr. Krabs: [in his thoughts] They haven't thrown me out yet...
Nancy Suzy Fish: Ma'am? [Reaches over to the button and is preparing to press it]
Mr. Krabs: [in his thoughts] It's all coming together now...
Nancy Suzy Fish: Can I help you, ma'am? A withdraw? A transfer? Anything!? Free interest!?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Oh-ho-oh yes! I'll have that please!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Okay, but you'll have to make a deposit first.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, of course! [takes out a penny] Here's me prized penny to deposit it into a new account!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Okay! I'll set it right up! [pulls out a drawer]
Mr. Krabs: [in his regular voice] Wait! [back in his feminine voice] Uh, what'cha doing? Penny doesn't want to be crammed in there with all those other coins. She wants a money condo of her own!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Okay. You want a safe deposit box then?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yes! Penny will have one of those!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Uh, this way please. [leads Mr. Krabs to a bunch other safe deposit boxes. She then is about to open one of the boxes to put his penny in]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Can i...have one moment with me penny? Alone?
Nancy Suzy Fish: [sighs] Make it quick. We're closing in five minutes. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, penny...I'm gonna miss ye...[sniffles and starts crying] It's inhuman I tell ya! Penny, penny...one last kiss goodbye. [gets into the safe deposit box and his female clothes falls to the ground. He goes back to using his regular voice.] It's just you and me now little penny! It's a wee bit cramped in here!
Nat Peterson: [walks by and notices the box open] Oh, well that looks secure...[closes the box and Mr. Krabs goes flying into the safe. Nat then locks the box] Were you people trained in a barn? [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: This can't be true! [picks up some money and starts to sniff them. He then actually sniffs off the hair on one of them] 'Tis true! I landed in money nirvan-er! [jumps up] Me wildest dreams finally come true! [laughs and lands in the pile of money. The scene changes over to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm done watering down the ketchup. Did you want me to...[looks and sees that Mr. Krabs isn't in his office] Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Would you pipe down!?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward! I can't find Mr. Krabs and he said he'd be right back! I'm getting a little concerned...
Squidward: That's nice...and...interesting...
SpongeBob: I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna go look for him! [runs out of the Krusty Krab] Hold on, Mr. Krabs! I'm coming for ya! [walks near a Bus Stop] Mr. Krabs! [walks through an open field] Mr. Krabs! [walks past the Hospital] Mr. Krabs! [walks by the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank] Mr. Krabs! [walks away and the scene changes back over to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Well, time to head home! [slides down a bunch of money] Whoo hoo! I hope to see each and every one of ya on the outside! [tries to climb up the hole and get out but the door is locked] Blimey, I'm locked in! [climbs back out the hole] I guess I'm trapped here all night! [jumps on a pile of money] With all of this moolah! So much moolah... [grabs a bill and blows on it] But no one to tell about it! Time to rustle up me some friends!
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' house]
SpongeBob: [knocks on the door until Pearl opens it] Oh, hi Pearl! Is Mr. Krabs here?
Pearl: No.
SpongeBob: Pearl, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Mr. Krabs is missing!
Pearl: [sarcastically] Oh my gosh.
SpongeBob: I know!
Pearl: Oh, my, gosh.
SpongeBob: Don't worry! I'll find him!
Pearl: [agitated] Oh my gosh! [hands SpongeBob her cell phone] Call him on his cell! [slams the door and the scene changes back over to the Bank]
Mr. Krabs: You look absolutely stunning tonight, Mrs. Greenback. Waiter! [snaps fingers] [speaks as waiter] Oui, oui, monsieur, what can I get you and zee lady tonight? [back to regular speaking] The lady would like to start with a million clams. A side of investments, and hold the taxes. I'll have the same. But with extra no taxes. [pushes the waiter out of view] Eh. Such a friendly fella. Good lookin' too. I'm almost gonna regret not leavin' him a tip. [cell phone rings] Hello?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? Are you okay?
Mr. Krabs: I'm fine boy! In fact, I'm dancing with a beautiful lady.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's nice.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, and she's made entirely out of money.
SpongeBob: What? Where are you?
Mr. Krabs: I'm locked in the bank vault, and having the time of me life. Oh, and I think I'm running out of oxygen, and it's making me lose my mind.
SpongeBob: I gotta save Mr. Krabs! [runs to Patrick's house] Patrick! Patrick, you gotta help me, buddy! I need to break into a bank! [Patrick stops drinking his water, and spits it back on SpongeBob]
Patrick: What?! SpongeBob SquarePants, we have been friends for a long time, and you've asked me to do some crazy things over the years. But breaking into a bank? [SpongeBob looks ashamed] Has to be the coolest!
Mr. Krabs: [at the bank] Ah. This is the life. [imagines a beach] Sun, sand, and surf. And of course. Mrs. Greenback by my side. What's that? Ah, don't start on me now. I'm sure this remote island has a food source! Krabs just hasn't found it yet, that's all. I'll just… eh, Heh eh-heh. So hungry.
SpongeBob: [outside the bank] Coast is clear! What's the plan, buddy?
Patrick: Okay. First we climb up the walls. [points up] Then, we slide down the chimney and eat up all the milk and cookies they left out for us!
SpongeBob: Well, I don't see a chimney. But we could try getting in through a roof vent. If only we had a way to scale this wall.
Patrick: Luckily, I brought the bank breaking kit! Uh. How about this? [holds out several shoelaces]
SpongeBob: A bunch of old shoelaces?
Patrick: It's as close as I'll ever get to having shoes.
SpongeBob: I wish we had something stronger. But this'll have to do. [throws shoelaces up, they catch a pipe, and hold. The shoelaces continue to untie, and SpongeBob jumps to catch each one]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! I got an idea! Let's use this grappling hook! [throws the grappling hook up, it catches. SpongeBob climbs up, while Patrick piggybacks. They tiptoe across the roof]
SpongeBob: This vent will surely lead us straight to Mr. Krabs!
Patrick: Let's get him! [the two jump into the vent, and bump all around the bank, then underground, and then through another building. They land on the ground in front of the bank.] Cool! Let's do that again!
SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick. We're running out of time. And more importantly, Mr. Krabs is running out of oxygen.
Mr. Krabs: [inside the imaginary island, it's on fire] Ohhh! So hungry! [stomach growls] Oh, why did I come to this uninhabit-abl-able island? Why did I do it? What! Huh, why did I say all that to Mrs. Greenback? I miss her… why isn't she? Mrs. Greenback! Where could she be? What have I done? [sees Greenback on the beach] Ah! Ms. Greenback! Oh, Ms. Greenback. [picks her up] You're okay! I was so worried. [mumbles, and rubs Greenback] I'm so sorry, you must never run away like that again. [As he rubs, all the money composing Mrs. Greenback flies away] What's this?! Ah! Little miss! What the Neptune?! [sees money dragon] A slimy money dragon! You're not sucking away me fortune without a fight! [attacks, and comes back to the real vault, shows he is attacking a a vacuum cleaner] Give me back Mrs. Greenback you beast!
SpongeBob: [outside the front doors to the bank] Patrick, you ready?
Patrick: This lock won't know what hit it! [sticks screwdriver into the lock]
SpongeBob: Ah, careful Patrick. Use finesse.
Patrick: Oh, right! [pulls out a crowbar] I'll use the finesse. [swings, and SpongeBob ducks. Closed signs switches to open, and they fall through the doors to the foot of the bank manager and night switches to day]
Bank Manager: Good morning, gentlemen. [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
Patrick: We've been rumbled! Run! Scatter! Scamper! Save yourself!
Bank Manager: What's all this about? [walks backwards to alarm button, SpongeBob pulls off ski mask.] May I help you with anything, sir?
SpongeBob: Ah. Yes, I need to make a withdrawal. I need to withdraw one Mr. Krabs!
Bank Manager: I assure you, Mr. SquarePants, we've received no such deposit. [opens vault]
Mr. Krabs: I've gotcha now, money sucker! That does it, Lizard-breath! It's you or me, now! Just you and me! [wrestles the vacuum, and breaks it. Laughs evilly] Ooh! I conquered the money dragon! Victory! Woo!
Bank Manager: Security! [security throws them out] And don't forget your… eh… deposit. [tosses penny at Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: You know, boyo. Through this whole ordeal, I've learned a little something about greed. A little something about isolation. Heh. Even a little something about love. And you know what I realized through it all?
SpongeBob: That you can't put a price on freedom?
Mr. Krabs: Barnacles no, boy! I realized that they didn't pay interest on me deposit! [shakes fist] Hey, you cheapskates! Give me me interest! [penny is thrown at Mr. Krabs] Well. What do you know? I doubled me money. [laughs as the episode ends]


[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Order up! [holds a Krabby Patty]
Squidward: [takes the Krabby Patty to customer] Here. [drops Krabby Patty with plate on table]
Baby/Plankton: [pops up from bottom of the table] Goo!
Harold: [looks up from reading newspaper and sees baby across the table] Hey, there.
Baby/Plankton: [makes spitting noise with tongue] Num, num! [takes Krabby Patty]
Harold: Aw, does baby want a Krabby Patty, hmm?
Fish #2: Awww.
SpongeBob: [holding onto Squidward] Baby's first Krabby Patty. [sniffles]
[Baby walks out the door, holding the Krabby Patty. Security camera looks at baby. Alarms go off and Mr. Krabs is alerted in his office. Mr. Krabs looks through periscope in his office.]
Mr. Krabs: [sees Plankton controlling the baby from the inside] That diabolical fiend!
Plankton: [from inside the baby suit] I can't believe this is working! It's like taking candy from a baby — with a baby.
Mr. Krabs: [from his office door] Stop right there, you thievin' infant!
[Baby stops and turns head around. It makes mechanical squeaks, looks at Mr. Krabs and rotates its head back and continues towards the door. Mr. Krabs dives for the baby while screaming and body slams it. The baby then drops the Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Yi-eeh! That's harsh.
Mr. Krabs: So you thought you could pull a fast one, eh? [holds baby up by the diaper] Now, come out of there, you little pest! [spanks the baby while grunting]
Fish #3: [gasps] What's he doing? You leave that poor baby alone! [points at Mr. Krabs and the baby]
Mr. Krabs: Okay. I guess we're gonna have to do this the hard way. [holds up his claw]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, no! Don't do it! [holds up his hand to stop Mr. Krabs]
[Mr. Krabs grunts and rips the baby in half. The head lands on the ground.]
Harold: [covers his mouth] Ooh! Oh... [faints]
Fish #3: Oh! [faints]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, calm down! It's just Plankton. [squeezes the baby's body and Plankton pops out] See?
Plankton: Uh... goo-goo?
Fish #1: How dare you! You toyed with our emotions! [pointing at Plankton and pokes him in the eye]
Plankton: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Face it, Plankton. You're never gonna win. I'll always be one step... ahead. [holds up the baby head and puts it back on the body and chuckles, then takes the baby outside with Plankton in it.] Now, why don't you go back to where you came from, you little brat? [kicks the baby out]
[3 fish who were standing outside gasp.]
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh.
Three Fish: You monster! How dare you! [yell at Mr. Krabs and beat him up with an umbrella, a purse, and a walker]
[Baby lands at the Chum Bucket and start to cry.]
Karen: Aww, diddums failed to get a Krabby Patty again? [picks up the baby and brings it inside]
Plankton: [still in the baby costume] Stop patronizing me! Why does every single plan fall apart? It's just a stupid sandwich! I tell you, it's wearing me down!
Karen: You need to stop obsessing over it. [lays baby down and changes his diaper] Relax. Get a hobby or something. [tosses dirty diaper with Plankton in it in the diaper bin]
Plankton: I hate to admit it, computer wife, but you're probably right. I need something to take my mind off that blasted secret formula for a while. [walks out of garbage bin from a door at the bottom of the can; walks over to window facing the Krusty Krab] But what?
Karen: I know. How about taking care of an inferior life-form?
Plankton: You mean a pet? That's a great idea! But how will I find a pet that fits my dynamic personality?
SpongeBob: [looking through the window] Plankton! [Plankton screams] I have the perfect solution to your problem.
Plankton: SpongeBob? How could you possibly help me?
SpongeBob: You should try the local animal shelter. That's where I found my Gary.
Plankton: Oh, yeah? Perhaps you're on to something there.
[Scene then cuts to the animal shelter.]
SpongeBob: Here it is. The Bikini Bottom Animal Shelter. [pets barking] Your perfect pet awaits. Now, if you just listen to your heart, you'll be able to pick out the right pet as soon as you see it. [barking continues]
Plankton: Hmm. Too big. [walks by worms and snails] Too sloppy.
Patrick: Duh... [sits in cage]
Plankton: [walks by Patrick] Too stupid.
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. [stops] Oh! Oh! What about this one? [looks at a sentient rock with algae growing on top]
Plankton: Are you kidding me? Algae on a rock? I want a pet, not a plant. It's no use. [pet snarls] There's nothing for me here. [pet's tongue grabs Plankton and he screams]
SpongeBob: Oh, no! Plankton!
Plankton: You know, I can't say I'm surprised.
[Barking noises are heard coming from another animal, which turns out to be an amoeba. The amoeba growls and chomps the pet holding Plankton. The pet that was holding Plankton screams and lets go.]
Plankton: [while amoeba continues to bark] Hey there, little guy. [pet barks and jumps into Plankton's arms] Looks like we have a winner!
SpongeBob: Oh, so cute! Whatcha gonna call him? He looks like a "Spot" to me.
[Pet chomps SpongeBob's finger and growls.]
Plankton: That name provokes a violent reaction. Spot it is!
[Spot licks Plankton, then barks and pants. Scene cuts to the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: Well, Spot, I'm your new owner, so shower me with love and affection. [Spot just sits quietly] Karen, it's not giving me unconditional love. I think it's defective.
Karen: You're gonna have to train him to do that.
Plankton: I train him? [sighs] I'll give it a shot. All right, Spot. Let's start with something easy. Stay. [picks up Spot and sits him down] Good boy. Now sit. [squishing noise of Spot sitting] Very good! Now roll over. [Spot barks] Excellent! Now shake. [Spot shakes his body, shaking the whole building] Wow! That's one mean shake you got there. I think we should burn off some of that extra energy. Would you like to go walkies? [holds up leash; Spot releases bubbles] I'll assume that's a yes. [put collar and leash on Spot] March! [Spot barks and begins walking as Plankton whistles; moments pass and Plankton starts getting tired and pants] Phew. We must've walked for miles. [notices he's only made it to the mailbox] I guess our legs are too short for walkies. How about a nice round of fetch? [brings back tennis ball and grunts] Fetch! [tennis ball lands on top of Spot and squishes him; Plankton screams] Oh no. What have I done? I'm a terrible pet owner! Terrible! Karen! We're gonna need another Spot! [Spot squishes himself back together and pops up from the ground, barking] Nice rebound, Spot! You know, I get squished a lot too. [sniffles and Spot licks him] I hope nobody saw that emotional outburst.
[Group of 3 fish standing near Plankton.]
Three Fish: Aww!
Plankton: Shoo!
[The three fish walk away. Scene then cuts back to the Chum Bucket, indoors.]
Plankton: Okay, Spot. Today, you'll learn how to be an attack pet to guard the Chum Bucket from intruders. Now, Spot, pretend I'm a burglar. [Plankton is seen wearing an animal costume] Attack! [Spot whimpers] You're not getting this? Come at me! Uh-oh... losing balance! [loses balance and falls over] A little help? [Spot jumps on Plankton and licks him] On second thought, what do I need a guard dog for? I can't even give chum away. What I really need is a retriever. [Plankton now showing Spot a picture of a Krabby Patty] This is your target. I want you to retrieve the Krabby Patty. Now, security is tight, so I've devised a pl-- [Spot walks away. Plankton flips to next page of plan with a picture of the Krusty Krab on it] Wait! Where are you going? You're not ready!
[Spot is seen sniffing around, then he opens the Chum Bucket door and leaves. He pops through Krusty Krab's front door, still sniffing around. He walks by Squidward at the cash register. SpongeBob walks out of the kitchen humming cheerfully. Spot goes into the kitchen.]
Fish #1: I'd like a large... [sees moving Krabby Patty on the ground] What was that?
Squidward: Didn't see it, don't care.
[Back at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is seen snoring and drooling. Spot drops Krabby Patty in front of Plankton and barks at him.]
Plankton: Holy plot twist! It's a Krabby Patty! It's... a miracle! [heavenly choir singing] Karen, look at what Spot brought home!
Karen: That's wonderful! Spot deserves a reward.
Plankton: He can have anything he wants, up to half my kingdom – uh, laboratory.
Karen: I think he wants your Krabby Patty.
[Spot pants and chomps the entire Krabby Patty.]
Plankton: [screaming] No! No! You've been a very bad amoeba! Bad amoeba! I'm afraid you'll have to be punished! You need a time out. I'm just gonna tie you up out here until you learn to behave! [ties Spot to mailbox] Shouldn't take more than five minutes. [Spot whimpers] Aww... no, no, I must be strong! [Spot whimpers as Plankton goes back into the Chum Bucket] I can't do it! [opens the door] Spot, I'm sorry! I — [sees the collar on the ground] Spot! He's gone! [crying] Where is he? Spot! Come back! [sobbing] Spot! Come back! Spot! Come back! I've got to find him!
[Group of 3 fish is back.]
Three Fish: Awww!
Plankton: Don't any of you have jobs? [searches for Spot] Spot! Spot! Where are you, Spot? [sobs at the Krusty Krab dumpster]
SpongeBob: [walks out of the Krusty Krab, holding a garbage bag] Why, Plankton, what's wrong? [dumps trash]
Plankton: I lost Spot.
SpongeBob: That's terrible! Gary lost me once. [shivers] I was cold, alone, starving. It was the worst eight minutes of my life. Come on, Plankton, let's find your pet. [picks up Plankton and tucks him under his arm]
[Plankton is now looking out from being tucked in SpongeBob's pants while they look for Spot in downtown Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: Lost pet! Anyone seen this lost pet? [holds up sign that reads "Have you seen this amoeba?" with a green speck on it] Lost pet emergency! Be on the lookout for a lost pet! Pardon me, sir. [stops man in suit] Have you seen this amoeba?
Fish #2: You mean that little speck?
SpongeBob: No. That little speck. [points to another speck on the sign]
Fish #2: Is this him? [holds up shoe]
Plankton: No, that's a piece of gum.
Fish #2: Gum? [pulls gum off] I've been looking everywhere for this! [puts it in mouth and chews it] If I was lookin' for a lost pet, I'd try the animal shelter.
Plankton: Of course!
SpongeBob and Plankton: The shelter!
[Both SpongeBob and Plankton head to the animal shelter.]
SpongeBob: I think it's closed for the night. [opens the door and it clanks] Ooh, it's dark in here. I'll find a light switch. Aha! [flips a switch and metal clanks are heard] Nope, that's not it. [flips another switch] Aha! Found the lights.
Plankton: Uh, SpongeBob? What was the first switch for?
SpongeBob: I don't know. I think it unlocks the pens?
Plankton: I thought so. Because now the animals are loose! [animals growl]  SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Run for it?
Plankton: Yep.
[SpongeBob picks up Plankton and runs away. Animals growl and chase them.]
SpongeBob: I think we lost 'em.
Plankton: SpongeBob, before we're torn to shreds, I'd like to thank you for helping me look for Spot.
SpongeBob: Aw, it was nothing. Hey, speaking of Spot. Did you always have a double pupil?
Plankton: A double what? [pulls a speck off of his eye] Spot! [dramatic music plays] Thank entropy you're safe! You were hiding on my optical cornea the whole time! You sneaky little amoeba, you. [Spot barks and licks Plankton; Plankton laughs]
SpongeBob: Aw, I'm glad you found Spot. [animals growl] Unfortunately, the animals found us too.
Plankton: Good-bye, Spot. I guess this is the end of the road for us. [Spot growls, barks, and jumps out of Plankton's arms] Spot, no!
[Spot barks at the other animals, who laugh at him. Spot snarls and grows to a much larger size and he growls loudly at the other animals. They all run away back into their cages and the cages close. Spot growls and shrinks back to his original size, then he jumps back into Plankton's arms.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Spot! You saved us!
Plankton: I taught him everything he knows! [Spot barks and licks Plankton]


[Episode starts with SpongeBob, and Patrick getting food at the Reef Cinema. They walk up to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Bet you can't guess what movie we're gonna see!
[Squidward didn't answer when he is drinking his drink]
SpongeBob: That's okay. I'll tell you.
[Squidward still didn’t answer when he’s still drinking his drink]
SpongeBob: It's Fisher...
Squidward: [puts one finger up then stops drinking and smacks his lips] Ah. You may speak.
SpongeBob: [takes a deep breath] Patrick and I are gonna see Fisherman 4! [he and Patrick smile]
Squidward: Ha! You two won't sleep a wink tonight if you see that movie.
SpongeBob: Squidward, you are looking at two very grown up big boys.
Patrick: Yeah. Nothing can scare us.
Squidward: [effortlessly] Boo.
SpongeBob and Patrick:: [still screaming, but stop and pant]
SpongeBob: Ahem. We'll show Squidward. We're not afraid of any old movie. [he and Patrick go in the aisle in the movie room. The door closes and it becomes pitch dark in there]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa!
Patrick: We're lost.
SpongeBob: I wish we had a flashlight. [a flashlight coming from a Cinema Anglerfish shines on them]
Cinema Anglerfish: Take your seats!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream and sit down]
SpongeBob: Seats taken, sir. Ooh, the movie's starting! [he and Patrick start eating their popcorn. The screen says, "The following preview has been approved for all audiences - S: Rated S for Scary." Then it says, "Fisherman 4: Attack of the Hook." Lightning flashes in the movie]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream]
Shubie: Shhh!
SpongeBob: Sorry. [In the movie, children are in a playground where Monroe Timmy and Billy are playing in a teeter totter] So isn't too scary. [The scene pans up to the fisherman's hook] The Fisherman's hook! Get off the teeter totter!
Patrick: You fools! [the hook goes into Monroe Timmy's mouth and pulls him up. He screams]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both scream]
SpongeBob: The Fisherman's got him!
Patrick: And he'll fry them into fish sticks! I can't watch! Is the scary part over?
SpongeBob: Hold on, I'll take a peek.
Edwina: Thank you for meeting me, Edwina, at midnight.
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's okay.
Patrick: You sure? [screams] It's worse! [fishes kiss] They're kissing!
Edwina: I love you, Susie.
Jennifer: It's Jennifer.
Edwina: I'll never leave you, Jennifer. [the Fisherman's hook drops down on-screen and grabs the male fish by his pants and pulls him up] Goodbye, Margaret!
SpongeBob and Patrick: The Fisherman! [throw their buckets of popcorn in the air. They fall on the three people behind them]
People: [scream, then grumble]
SpongeBob: Uh, sorry, sorry, sorry! [he and Patrick get their buckets back]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream and hide in the hole in their seats]

{{L|Narrator|Two hours later...

Patrick: See if it's safe. [SpongeBob puts his head out of his seat. The screen says, "The End"]
SpongeBob: Aww, the movie's over. [Patrick does the same. Everyone gets out of their seats]
Patrick: Oh, dang. We hardly even saw it.
SpongeBob: Well, we'll watch it again. And this time, all the way through. [scene cuts to him and Patrick watching the movie again. There are two kid fish eating ice cream in the movie] Okay. Keep your eyes open.
Patrick: No problem.
Kid Fish in Movie: I love eating ice cream.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm getting scared. Hold my eyelids open.
Patrick: I'm on it. [goes to the row behind them and pulls SpongeBob's eyelids]
SpongeBob: D'ohhhh! [the Fisherman's hook is lowered and takes the fish's ice cream]
Kid Fish in Movie: Hey! My ice cream! [falls to the ground and cries] No! It was rocky road!
SpongeBob: Must close eyes! Too scary!
Patrick: I can't hold your eyelids—they're too slippery! [SpongeBob's eyelids close and his hands get stuck in them] Ow! [screams]
SpongeBob: [screams as a fish walks by sweeping but stops when he hears SpongeBob and Patrick screaming. He continues sweeping and starts whistling. SpongeBob and Patrick are hugging each other. Patrick has his bucket on his head. SpongeBob looks at the screen. It says, "The end" again] Oh, no, we missed the movie.
Patrick: What?! Not again!
SpongeBob: It's okay, we'll just see the next one.
Cinema Anglerfish: I'm afraid not. That was the last showing.
SpongeBob: Wow. Uh, what time is it?
Cinema Anglerfish: It is one minute to midnight.
SpongeBob: One... minute... to midnight?! [he and Patrick get out of their seats]
Patrick: But that's when the Fisherman comes out! [he and SpongeBob run out of the room]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, we've got to get home!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick:  [scream] The Fisherman! [they have ran into a cardboard cutout of the Fisherman with the title of the movie beside it. They run out of the Reef Cinemas screaming] ''[the clock tolls, meaning that it's midnight. A little cardboard cutout of the Fisherman comes out of the clock and lowers his cardboard hook and catches a cardboard fish. It goes back in the clock] It's midnight! The Fisherman! [run to SpongeBob's door]
SpongeBob: Phew. We made it.
Patrick: I guess we showed that old horror movie who's boss.
SpongeBob: Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact.
Patrick: It's like we're heroes.
SpongeBob: Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow.
Patrick: Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?
SpongeBob: No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door. [starts walking Patrick to his door]
Patrick: Darn old horror movie. Why couldn't we watch a cartoon instead? [foghorn blows] Do you hear that?
SpongeBob: [whispering] I think it's coming from over there. [points to fog. A shadow comes behind it]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: It's the Fisherman! [scream and hide behind Patrick's rock; Slasher McGee passes by on a small bike with training wheels]
SpongeBob: Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there. [tries to move but doesn't] Just a few steps that away. [tries again but fails] In the dark? All alone?
Patrick: Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home. [starts walking SpongeBob home]
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?
Patrick: Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it. [a shadow comes over them. Behind the fog there is a shadow of the Fisherman] 
SpongeBob and Patrick: The Fisherman! [scream but then notice that the shadow is actually of jellyfish who had formed a shadow of the Fisherman. SpongeBob and Patrick continue screaming. Squidward wakes up and growls. He gets out of bed. SpongeBob and Patrick run around screaming but stop and pant]
Squidward: What is wrong with you?! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and jump to Squidward's windows. They shiver]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Squidward.
Squidward: What are you blockheads up to? Don't you know it's after midnight? Get down here!
Patrick: We can't get home.
SpongeBob: We're too scared. [Squidward growls. Scene changes to Squidward walking to Patrick's rock with SpongeBob on his head wearing his nightcap and Patrick holding onto him]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Thank you, Squidward. You are a true friend. [Squidward opens Patrick's rock with his left foot and throws Patrick in]
Patrick: Thanks, Squidwar... [Squidward closes his rock and grumbles. He walks over to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Yeah, thanks, Squidward. I don't think we would've ever gotten home with you.
Squidward: Hat.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Here. [gives Squidward's nightcap back. Squidward pulls SpongeBob's legs, which shoots him through his mail slot and into his bed]
Squidward: I told those muttonheads not to see that movie. [walks into his house]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Are you okay?
Patrick: Yeah! Are you okay?
SpongeBob: I think so! Good night!
Patrick: Yeah., good night! Just don't think about the Fisherman!
SpongeBob: Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!
Squidward: Oh, "The Fisherman." "The Fisherman." Blah, blah, blah. They want a Fisherman, eh? I'll give them a Fisherman! And how! [goes to his closet and turns on the light. He pulls out a vampire costume] No. [pulls out a Frankenstein costume] No. [pulls out an Easter Bunny costume] Um... no. [pulls out a fisherman's hat and coat] Aha! [lightning strikes. Squidward is outside and has the coat on] It's time for those lame-brains to meet the real Fisherman. [puts on the hat with a beard attached to it. Lightning strikes again as Squidward lowers the hook from the fishing rod] This is gonna be good. [laughs. Lightning strikes again. Squidward is in a boat on the roof of his house his hook at Patrick's rock, scrapes it, and opens it a little four times. Patrick wakes up and opens his rock with his head]
Patrick: Uh, hello? Someone there? [the hook hooks under his left nostril] Uh, uh? What's that? [stammers] There's something stuck... [grunts] Huh. [the hook starts pulling it] Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. A little to the left. [drools] Oh, yeah. All right. Right there. [laughs. Squidward laughs and pulls the hook]
Squidward: Gotcha! [the hook pulls Patrick out of his rock]
Patrick: [screams as he sees Squidward] The Fisherman! [screams and runs]
Squidward: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. [the rod goes after Patrick and starts to pull Squidward and the boat with it; Squidward screams; the boat rides up Patrick's open rock and soars in the air. Patrick screams twice while Squidward starts laughing. He runs to SpongeBob's house, pulls his door open, goes inside, and closes the door causing Squidward to smash into the door. Patrick sees Squidward outside, laughing. Patrick runs, with his face ripped off from the hook, he runs up to SpongeBob's bedroom] SpongeBob! Get up! He's here!
SpongeBob: Who's here? Hold on, let me get up. [scream] Your face!
Patrick: Oh. [takes his head and stretches it, making his face whole again] There.
SpongeBob: Now who's here?
Patrick: Uh, someone's here?
SpongeBob: You just said.
Patrick: Oh. The Fisherman's here.
SpongeBob: The Fisherman!
Patrick: The Fisherman!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [scream and run in circles on SpongeBob's bed]
Squidward: Ha Ha Ha Ha. This is the most perfect. What a couple of hopeless babies. I really should stop. But I'm having too much fun. (goes in SpongeBob's house) Ha. It's almost too easy.
SpongeBob: Quick. Block the door.
Squidward: There's just no sport in it.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick push stuff over to SpongeBob bedroom door] Get everything?
Patrick: What about this? (Patrick holds Gary)
SpongeBob: Not Gary. Think it'll hold?
Patrick: I sure hope so. (SpongeBob and Patrick look into window and sees Squidward, laughing)
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: (scream as Squidward opens the window and then scream again)
Patrick: Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah. Just like the movie. (they close their eyes, later open them to see Squidward behind them)
Squidward: I'm the Deadly Fisherman!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick:  (scream)
SpongeBob: I guess this is the end, old buddy.
Patrick: I don't want to die in my underwear!
SpongeBob: Here. (SpongeBob takes off his underwear) Die in mine.
Patrick: Hey. Good idea. Let's trade. (Patrick takes off his underwear) Here you go.
SpongeBob: And here you go. (SpongeBob and Patrick trade underwears and puts on their underwears) Now where were we? Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [screams] He's gonna turn us into fish sticks!
Squidward: [laughing]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick:  (scream)
SpongeBob: That thing's eating Squidward!
Patrick: Not our bestest buddy! We gotta save him! Okay, play 33. I need you to go long. And... break. You're going down, Fisherman! [starts beating up Squidward's Fisherman costume while SpongeBob grabs Squidward's neck]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window. [He and Sauidward jump out of the window and Patrick throws heavy objects onto Squidward] Okay! I think you got it! [Sirens sound] [Squidward grumbles as he is taken into an ambulance] Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, there, there, no need to thank us. We were only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that old monster anymore. [The Fisherman costume growls at them]
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [scream and run into ambulance. The Fisherman costume falls down, revealing Gary]
Gary: Meow. [starts sleeping on the costume]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab and Squidward is doing his duty at the cash register. Just then, something sucks through the window behind him. He looks in and sees SpongeBob trying to hold his breath]
Squidward: SpongeBob, how about more Krabby Patties and less heavy breathing?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob uses his spatula to stop the alarm clock and he breathes out the air he's been holding onto Squidward causing his head to expand. Squidward pushes backs out of the window] Wow! That's the longest I've held my breath: three whole seconds. I'm gonna try for five seconds next. [takes a very deep breath]
Squidward: Keep that up and you'll lose consciousness. [under his breath] Tentacles crossed.
SpongeBob: [trying to hold his breath as his face turns blue] Silly Squidward. I'm not going to-- [loses consciousness as Mr. Krabs bursts in the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: What's going on around here? [notices SpongeBob lying unconscious on the kitchen floor. He takes out the bottle containing the secret formula and the smell of it revives him. SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob [speaking gibberish]: What's going on?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I could be asking you the same thing, boy.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was merely emulating my latest media obsession... [points to a poster saying "KENNY! The Cat" with a picture of Kenny on it] ♪ Kenny the Cat ♪
Mr. Krabs: Kenny the Cat? What in clams' name is a... "the cat"?
SpongeBob: He's the greatest undersea athlete to originate from above the wet and briney. [points to several pictures of Kenny's famous career] And he's been shattering records all over, holding his breath as he walks the ocean floor. I want to be just like Kenny the Cat. [takes a deep breath and holds it as he walks to Mr. Krabs] That's what he does: he walks like that and holds his breath like that. Kenny is a sensationality. [takes out a tray of uncooked patties with lettuces cut in the shape of Kenny the Cat's head] Haven't you noticed my recent lettuce customization?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: [runs up to a huge collection of magazines with Kenny the Cat on them] And you haven't perused my collection of Kenny the Cat periodicals? [turns on the tv] Or noticed Kenny on every TV channel known to fishkind?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, no.
SpongeBob: [opens the door and a blimp shaped in the head of Kenny the Cat is flying] But what about the Kenny the Cat blimp which hovers over Kenny the Cat Sports Stadium?
Mr. Krabs: Never noticed it. [walks away, unimpressed]
SpongeBob: Huh. You haven't seen him in your wallet?
Mr. Krabs: [stops and gasps as he takes out his wallet] Me wallet?! What's he been doing in there? [takes out a couple of dollar bills with Kenny the Cat on them]
SpongeBob: Oh, he's on all the new $50 bills.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that Kenny the Cat. Well, he's a sensationality.
SpongeBob: Yeah! And he's visiting Bikini Bottom tomorrow with hundreds of his rabidly, loyal fans.
Mr. Krabs: Hundreds, you say?
SpongeBob: Maybe even a thousand! [Mr. Krabs poses himself as a dollar sign in joy and triumph]
Mr. Krabs: Say, kiddo, why don't see if you can't get old Kenny and his throng of fans to visit the old Krusty Krab for a while?
SpongeBob: I shall do my Krustiest, sir. [cuts to SpongeBob visiting Sandy's treedome but with no water helmet]
Sandy: [notices SpongeBob not wearing a water helmet and gasps in horror of his safety] SpongeBob, don't you want your water helmet? [tries to give him one as SpongeBob walks in holding his breath]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Not necessary, Sandy. Like my personal hero, Kenny the Cat, I'm A-ok. [SpongeBob makes an A-ok hand-gesture. He suddenly dries up and falls flat on the grass]
Sandy: [sprays water on SpongeBob with a hose] Well, if you ain't going to use your helmet, I suggest you make it quick, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [restores to normal] Hey, Sandy, you're kinda like a cat, aren't you?
Sandy: [flips her head upside-down in disbelief] Cat?! [turns her head rightside-up] In what way am I kind of like a cat?
SpongeBob: Well, aren't cats and squirrels basically the same thing?
Sandy: We are both mammals, but that is where the similarities end. Cats are no good scoundrels and I ain't never trusting one of them!
SpongeBob: Well, you can trust Kenny the-. He's the heroic cat who has been holding his breath for days at a time.
Sandy: [continues to spray water on SpongeBob with her hose] I hate to precipitate on your party, SpongeBob, but that is impossible. No air breather could ever do that. Not even me! [quivers in fear]
SpongeBob: Very well, Sandra. If that is your stance, then so be it. Could "someone" be jealous of Kenny's dazzling lung capacity? [cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick in sleeping bags, and wearing foam hands on the street waiting for Kenny the Cat]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Kenny the Cat! Kenny the Cat! Kenny the Cat! [Nat Peterson walks by]
Nat Peterson: You do know that Kenny won't be here until 10:00.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Nat Peterson: Tomorrow morning.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh, yeah. 14 hours is cutting it close but I had to work all day.
Nat Peterson: Hopeless. [walks away]
SpongeBob: You know, I read in Kenny Fancy Magazine that he's so used to holding his breath that when he's topside, he forgets to breathe.
Patrick: Wow! [laughs] Oh, that'd be like me forgetting to-- [panicking] Oh! Oh, oh, oh...[takes out a taco from his pocket] Oh, there you are, pocket taco. [eats it]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick, have you ever gazed up into the starry night and see Kenny the Cat's face?
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: [makes shapes with his fingers like he's connecting the dots] Find the goober constellation and the dorsal constellation, then squint your eyes and let the details fall into place. [a picture of Kenny the Cat is seen in the starry sky]
Patrick: [tries to see it but can't] Uh... Nope, I don't see it. Kenny's really gotten into your head lately.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Kenny's awesome. Hey, that reminds me! [takes out his make-up kit] Let's paint our faces to look like Kenny! [puts make-up on Patrick's face] Perfect! [Patrick's face is painted in a really ugly looking design of Kenny the Cat] We're the biggest Kenny the Cat fans ever!
Patrick: [Patrick looks at himself in the mirror] This, uh, is getting creepy.
SpongeBob: [paints a nasty looking cat face on himself] Hey, buddy. Check it out.
Patrick: [SpongeBob's make-up scares Patrick] Sweet Neptune! Uh, SpongeBob, uh, I'm going to go now. Your obsession with Kenny is getting weird.
SpongeBob: But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo! [pulls down his pants and shows Patrick his tattoo]
Patrick: Oh, that's okay. See you, SpongeBob! [runs away completely freaked out]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess it's plain to see who the true Kenny the Cat fan is. [cuts to SpongeBob still awake in his sleeping bag until his alarm clock goes off] 10:00! Kenny Time! [jumps out of his sleeping bag and stands next to the announcer]
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time you've all been waiting for. Kenny the Cat will do his signature walk. [Kenny comes down the street, photographers take pictures]
SpongeBob: [head turns into the shape of a heart] Kenny!
Harold: Thanks, Kenny! [Kenny signs his fin]
SpongeBob: Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula. [Kenny signs spatula] Thanks, Kenny. You're so real. [Kenny nods in agreement] Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab? [Kenny gives him his A-ok handsign. SpongeBob stutters] Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign! [does a silly dance] Swoon! Swoon! [cut to the Krusty Krab where a huge crowd is in front of it]
Crowd: [random chatter]
Mr. Krabs: One at a time, one at a time, please! Kenny the Cat will have time to meet each and every one of you's. [quietly] And I will have time to take each and every one of your dollars. [normal voice; shocked] Look at myself. I'm not being a very good host. [goes to Kenny Uh, excuse me. You just make yourself at home, Kenny. I mean, Mr. the Cat. [takes out two ketchup packets and one mustard packet] Here you go! Condiments. On the house. Don't tell anybody. Welcome to the Krusty Krab family. [laughs]
[Kenny's oxygen tank slips from his back]
SpongeBob: Mr. the Cat? Everything OK? [Kenny draws a toilet and shows it to him] Say, Mr. Krabs, this is gonna be a long day for Kenny. How about we give him a minute to freshen up?
Mr. Krabs: What an excellent idea, SpongeBob! "A clean cat is a moneymaking cat," I always say. Please avail yourself of the lounge facilities. [Kenny goes to the washroom]
SpongeBob: Well, I'd best get back manning the grill.
Kenny: [takes out the oxygen tank and throws it on the ground] This gets real uncomfortable after a while. [breathes in. His face turns blue. He runs to the oxygen tank] 
SpongeBob: [enters the bathroom with a Krabby Patty on a plate] Sorry to bother you, Mr. the Cat, but I thought you'd just like a bite to… [drops the patty] Whoa!
Kenny: [breathes through the oxygen tank and sighs. SpongeBob starts to panic] Good thing I've got this oxygen tank and mask, or otherwise there's no way I'd be able to hold my breath for this long.
SpongeBob: [camera zooms in to his heart which has a face similar to his. It loses a tooth and eye, then breaks] How could you, Kenny?! You broke my heart! Here I was this entire time believing your act, only to discover that it was nothing but... an act!
Kenny: But it's not what you think!
SpongeBob: There's no room for thoughts now. Only for tears. [runs away, sobbing]
Kenny: SpongeBob, wait! [trips over the oxygen tank, and uses it again]
SpongeBob: I can't believe I fell for such a phony! Oh, well, time to move on. Guess I don't need my Kenny the Cat fan club membership card anymore. [rips card and sniffles] Or these Kenny the Cat posters. Oh, Kenny, how could you? [sobs]: You were my idol! You know, I should really talk about this with someone, or I might get... [close up of his face] depressed.
Kenny: SpongeBob, please, let me explain! I'm just a cat with a dream. A dream to give the gift of hope. See, above water, I'm a nobody: just another annoying cat. But down here, I'm someone special: someone who can make people happy. And if making the world a happier place makes me a criminal... [starts to sob] ...then lock me up and throw away the key. Have mercy! [sobbing]
SpongeBob: All right, Kenny, all right. I promise I won't tell anyone.
Kenny: Really?
SpongeBob: Yes, really. 
Kenny: All right! Thanks, Bob. You're the best friend I ever had! Now if you'll excuse moi, I've got to sign some autographs. [exits the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, the cat of the hour is back!
Crowd: [cheering]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollars—I mean, uh, suckers—I mean, uh, some autographs? [Kenny nods his head]
Crowd: [cheering]
Mr. Krabs: Well, alrighty then. That's what the consuming public wants to hear.
Billy Fishbowl: Sir, I just want to say that you're the biggest inspiration myself and my friends have ever known. Your ability to hold your breath changed our lives... forever. [looks at his three friends. They are holding their breath while their faces turn purple. One of them falls down]
SpongeBob: [looks worried. He reads the note that Kenny wrote] "You're welcome. I've been holding my breath for more than 20 years, no problem." [gulps] "You can too. Signed, Kenny the Breath-Holding Cat"?
Sandy: Hiya, Kenny. Mind if I get your signature? [Kenny writes the signature] Gee, it sure is nice to meet another air-breathing, warm-blooded varmit down here.
Kenny: Mm-hmm.
Sandy: Just out of scientific curiosity, how do you hold your breath for so long? [SpongeBob and Kenny react]
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Uh, we needn't burden ourselves with such needless scientific technicalities, Sandy.
Sandy: I'm just wondering, SpongeBob. I mean, he does defy all scientific logic, [Kenny starts to sweat] considering the fact that all air breathing mammals need oxygen to the brain and lungs to survive for more than 3 minutes. [Sandy makes a serious face at Kenny. SpongeBob pushes her]
SpongeBob: Hey, maybe we should show our fine guest a little more hospitality, hmm?
Sandy: [pushes him back] What has gotten into you, SpongeBob? Can't I talk about what must surely be happening from a biological standpoint? I mean, like the lack of oxygen will heighten the capillaries in the lungs, causing a dangerous level of carbon monoxide to rise in the bloodstream, which in turn leads to a ghostly blue color to the skin, [Kenny's skin turns blue] followed by eventual unconsciousness.
Kenny [screaming]: I can't take it! I need oxygen! [punches himself for his oxygen tank]
Crowd: [gasps]
Kenny: [uses the oxygen tank and sighs]
Sandy: I knew Kenny was a fake! 
Crowd: [boos and leaves]
Crowd Member: Liar!
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! [to Kenny] Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too! [takes back the condiments he gave Kenny. Cut to outside]
SpongeBob: Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career.
Kenny: [in a suit like Sandy's] Aww. It's okay, SpongeBob. Maybe the whole shamble is a big wake-up call to be honest. 
SpongeBob: Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special.
Kenny: I like it! [does the A-ok handsign. SpongeBob does it back]
Sandy: Just get out of here already. [pops part of his suit, and he is rocketed back to the surface] You can never trust a cat. Or is it a dog?


[The episode opens with Squidward sleeping at the Krusty Krab with a magazine on his face until Mr. Krabs takes it off]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward!
Squidward: [screams] What is your problem?
Mr. Krabs: My problem is that you aren't workin'! Which means I lose M-U-N-E-E! Which means you lose your J-O-B!
Squidward: Remind me again, is that good news or bad news?

{{L|Mr. Krabs|Tentacles, I mean it! [pointing to Squidward again] You get back to mindin' that register!

Squidward: Minding it for [pointing at an empty Krusty Krab] which customer?
Mr. Krabs: I see your point. But still, I'm not paying you to dream sweet nothin's! Do something! Pick up a mop, a broom, uh, a window wiper, a spatula, even!
Squidward: SpongeBob's got that covered.
SpongeBob: [mops the floor while humming, and as he sweeps, he comes across the window, causing his eye to protrude out, then he gasps] Dust specs on the window! Don't worry, boss man, I got it covered! [generates an extra arm with a window wiper and wipes the window] That's better! Oh, sounds like the dishes are done soaking! [makes his way to the kitchen sink by stretching his body and begins humming again]
Mr. Krabs: That's a perfect example of what I'm talkin' about! Stayin' busy!
Squidward: I was busy, trying to forget about this place 'till you woke me up.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, have it your way, Squidward! Since you can't be bothered to take the initiative yourself, it's clear I must assign tasks to you. Hmm... Mr. Squidward, scrub the walls of the Krusty Krab 'till they gleam!
SpongeBob: Already done, sir! [comes sliding off the wall, then a shot of a sparkling Krusty Krab is shown]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's very nice, boy, thank you. But, you see, I'm tryin' to give Squidward a task.
SpongeBob: Hmm... well, the smoke duct needs sweeping!
Mr. Krabs: Excellent idea, Mr. SquarePants! Squidward, I'd like you to sweep-- [hears a noise in the ducts and looks up at them and a dirty SpongeBob coming out of the ducts]
SpongeBob: Done and dusted! [coughs up a puff of smoke]
Squidward: Nice working conditions, but, no thanks! [grabs his magazine]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, is that so? [lifts the bottom of one of the tables with gum underneath] Perhaps you'd prefer scraping the gum off the underside of these tables!
Squidward: Oh, a restaurant employee handling chewed bubble gum? That's gotta violate a lot of health codes.
SpongeBob: [while pulling off a piece of gum from the underside of another table] Not if you wear gloves, it doesn't. [pulls on the gum, then sticks on a giant ball of chewed gum] Mind if I take this to Patrick after work, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I guess SpongeBob has a handle on all the Krusty Krab duties. Which leaves you with all the extracirculars! [puts a pair of shoes on the edge of the cashier boat] Like shinin' me shoes!
Squidward: Sorry, all out of polish.
SpongeBob: [appears out of the boat, then polishes the shoes] Well, I'm not!
Mr. Krabs: Wash me boat! [spots SpongeBob outside the Krusty Krab, filling himself up with water and washing the boat while humming] Listen, Squidward, I'm gonna get a full day's work out of you one way or another.
Squidward: It doesn't matter what you "want" me to do, I won't do it!
[Mr. Krabs gets really angry and his face turns purple, however, he gets an idea.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho, yeah? Fine...if you refuse to work, then I can't be held responsible.
SpongeBob: [coming in from washing Mr. Krabs' boat] Responsible for what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: For...for... [thinks for a second] ...a visit from...the Yeti Krab.
SpongeBob: [gulps] The Yeti Krab?
Mr. Krabs: [comes close to SpongeBob] Yeah. Everyone's heard of the abominable Yeti Krab... [pulls his eyebrows longer] ...with his long, wide hair, and six-pack abs... [shows his teeth] ...and yeller' teeth! And everybody knows that he only comes out of his mountain cave to feed on lazy workers. [comes close to Squidward] He's attracted to the scent, he can smell your lazy, lazy stench from hundreds of miles away!
SpongeBob: [screams] Oh, wait. What am I worried about? I'm a hard-working, self-motivated sponge.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, but that won't make any difference because of your proximity to Squidward's laziness. You will be eaten!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward and I are as close as brothers!
Squidward: Ludicrous.
Mr. Krabs: You won't think so if that big, hairy fellow wants to eat ya! [chuckles] Yeah. Now, listen up, boys! Bossman Krabs is steppin' out for a minute. [while putting dirty clothes on the order boat] But I want this tub of laundry done before I come back, or...
SpongeBob: Or the Yeti Krab will smell our laziness and eat us!
Mr. Krabs: Precisely. See ya, boys! [steps out of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Whatever. [relaxes]
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing? [sniffs] Oh, no! Your lack of work is taking on an odor!
Squidward: [picks up a pair of underwear] You sure it's not these you're smelling?
SpongeBob: If the Yeti Krab catches wind of it, he's gonna... [his nose pops like a balloon] you know, [whispers] eat us!
Squidward: Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Krabs' Yeti story is a complete and total crock!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, Mr. Krabs would never make up something like that!
Squidward: You can believe in whatever garbage you want to. Just do it away from me. Now, run along and wash Krabs' undies.
SpongeBob: You got it, Squidward! [SpongeBob forms into a washing machine and takes Mr. Krabs' dirty laundry] Anything to keep that Yeti Krab at bay. [puts the laundry in his mouth, then puts laundry soap through his head, turns his eye like a knob to delicate, and pulls his nose to start the washing process]
Narrator: Just then... By sheer coincidence...
[Cuts to the mountain tops where a mysterious monster with red crab claws and white fur is lurking. The monster is revealed to be the Yeti Krab that was mentioned by Mr. Krabs earlier. The Yeti Krab sniffs the air and walks menacingly towards Bikini Bottom. He stops and sniffs a sign with an arrow and the word Bikini Bottom on it. He smashes it with his claws and continues walking. He stops and sniffs at a mailbox. He takes a bite of it but spits it out. He continues walking until he stops at a department store named Gramma's Closet. He sniffs the window and growls at it. He continues to walk until he feels a growling motion in his body. It shows his heart, lungs, and stomach. The stomach looks more agitated than the heart and lungs.]
Yeti Krab's stomach: Let me out of here, you hairy brute! I can find my own food!
[The Yeti Krab roars in disgust and hunger until he smells the scent of Krabby Patties. He immediately runs to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob in cleaning the tables.]
SpongeBob: [hears someone at the door] Good day, sir. Are you Yeti to order? [notices the Yeti Krab is behind him and runs towards Squidward who is sound asleep] Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: [wakes up] What? What? What? Wha... huh?
SpongeBob: You are not gonna believe this! There's a Yeti Krab at table 7! And he is sniffing out the lazy!
Squidward: [laughs] Of course, he is. Nice costume, Eugene. Couldn't you at least have it dry-cleaned or pressed? [The Yeti Krab roars at SpongeBob and Squidward in the faces] Didn't brush this morning. Did we?
SpongeBob: Please don't eat us, Mr. Yeti! We're not lazy!
Squidward: [sits back and relaxes] Oh, yes I am.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! I'll have to work twice as hard to make up for Squidward's laziness! [runs to the tables and pushes some chairs in. The Yeti Krab walks up to SpongeBob as the young fry cook chuckles nervously. However, the table starts to wobble] A wobbly table! Oh, we can't have that! [SpongeBob sticks a door stopper underneath one side of the table stand, but the table continues to wobble. SpongeBob places another door stopper on the other side, but it still continues to wobble.] Come on. No. [SpongeBob continues to fix the table as the Yeti Krab grows impatient and growls.] There! Perfect! [The table now has a huge stack of door stoppers underneath. SpongeBob walks to the condiment dispensers and opens the mustard.] Yikes! Time to top off the mustard! [SpongeBob pulls a large bag of mustard, rips it open, and over fills the dispenser. SpongeBob then runs into the kitchen towards the spice rack.] See I'm busy! I'm organizing the spice racks! By color! [The Yeti Krab sniffs some of the spices, but sneezes really hard. The force of he sneeze makes SpongeBob bounce around the kitchen. SpongeBob slams on the wall and slides down next to the grease trap door.] Well, I guess while I'm down here, I'll hit the old grease traps again. [opens the door and reveals bubbling grease underneath. SpongeBob takes a large barrel and begins to absorb the grease with his left arm and foot. He uses his right arm and foot to fill up the barrel and SpongeBob sighs in relief. The Yeti Krab takes one sample of grease, sniffs it, and eats it with his claw. SpongeBob becomes startled and grease spits out of his body.] I'm not lazy! Don't eat me! [The grease is sprayed on the Yeti Krab and he aggressively roars. The scene cuts to the lazy Squidward reading the newspaper.] I'm sorry, Mr. Yeti Krab!
Squidward: [sighs] I almost feel sorry for the little nimrod. [Then drops of varnishing liquid splatters in the newspaper and on Squidward's hat] What the? Do you mind?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is upside-down, mopping the ceiling with varnishing liquid] Sorry, Squidward! Just varnishing the ceiling!
Squidward: [turns to the Yeti Krab] Oh, I hope you're happy, Mr. Krabs! You're driving him insane! [The Yeti Krab growls at Squidward] Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll eat me if I'm lazy. Whatever. [The Yeti Krab roars real loudly until sparks causes him to back away. The sparks burn Squidward's newspaper to the crisp.] Not the home and garden section! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is burning the metal shut on Mr. Krabs' office door]
SpongeBob: [Takes off the mask] Huh? Oh, sorry. Just making all the rivets are securely welded.
Squidward: SpongeBob, we have no customers today! Ergo, we have nothing to do! No matter what that buffoon wants you to think!
SpongeBob: Shh! Squidward, he might hear you! Don't worry, Mr. Yeti Krab! We have plenty to do! [SpongeBob gets off his chair and carries a pile of toilet paper to the bathroom] I can replenish the toilet paper! [Then runs with a bucket of paint and a paint roller] And redecorate Mr. Krabs' office! [Then sits to the table and makes origami with some napkins] And refold the napkins into origami figures! [Then knits some things with yarn and needles] Knit straw cozies! [The straws are covered in knitted cozies. SpongeBob then sprays a bar of soap with the dishwasher hose] Clean the soap! [Then cleans grill with a surface waxer] Re-clean the grill! [Goes outside the kitchen] Washing inside the walls! [Slides into the wall and comes back out covered in filth. Then takes a vacuum and sweeps the table with it.] Sucking up every dust particle in the restaurant! [SpongeBob sucks Squidward's newspaper with the vacuum.]
Squidward: Have you lost it, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: Lost it? [chuckles nervously] Lost it? [chuckles] What a silly thing to say! [The vacuum sucks SpongeBob's hat. SpongeBob becomes more nervous and runs in panic]
Squidward: [sighs] Guess I'm down to the comic section. [SpongeBob backs up in fear and jump in front of Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Squidward! You were right! There's no more work to do! [hugs Squidward] I have done it all! [The Yeti Krab slashes the newspaper in pieces with his claws and roars viciously] Which means he is gonna eat us! [The Yeti Krab chases SpongeBob]
Squidward: That does it! [Squidward goes to through the back door where the dumpster is] I have had it with this ridiculous ruse! [He takes an empty trash bin and stuck his feet through. Then he jumps on two empty shoe boxes and made them look like shoes.] Using fear to prey on a feeble mind! [Digs through the garbage and pulls out an old cushion.] Even SpongeBob doesn't deserve that! [Takes some of the stuffing out and puts some on his face, arms and legs to look like fur. He then takes a mop and rips it off the stick.] Enjoy spooking the witless, eh Krabs? Well, we'll just see how you like it. [Puts the mop on his head and sticks his eyes out through like crab eyes. The Yeti Krab is about to attack SpongeBob until Squidward bursts in with his disguise.] Roar! See? I can dress up as a convincing Yeti Krab too! [The Yeti Krab roars in Squidward's face.]
SpongeBob: [Sweats uncontrollably] T-T-T-T-T-T-Two Yeti Krabs! [SpongeBob cringes in fear as his brain pops and releases air. SpongeBob then passes out.]
Squidward: [Squidward is now on top of the Yeti Krab pulling his head] Take off that phony suit, Mr. Krabs! You're not fooling anybody! [At that same moment, the real Mr. Krabs shows up at the front door.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm back, fellas!
Squidward: [Still pulling on the Yeti Krab's head] Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm a little busy trying to pull off this stupid mask of yours.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, Squidward?
Squidward: What? [Squidward looks for a minute at Mr. Krabs and the Yeti Krab. He is finally convinced that the Yeti Krab is real, not Mr. Krabs in disguise. He shrieks as the Yeti Krab glares at him. The Yeti Krab grabs Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and the unconscious SpongeBob, ties them to the grill and turns the heat up to cook.]
Mr. Krabs: We're as good as Yeti food! I blame Squidward!
SpongeBob: [Regains consciousness] Guys, do you hear that?
Squidward: You mean the sound of my own flesh sizzling to a crisp? [The Yeti Krab's stomach growls]
SpongeBob: No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer. He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy, he wants to eat us because he's hungry. Fellas, leave this to me.
[SpongeBob takes out a can of "Emergency Krabby Patties" out of his pocket with his feet and open it with his nose. He puts three patties on the grill and cooks them. Then he uses his feet to flip the patties with the spatula, puts them in buns with tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, ketchup, and mustard on a plate and serves them to the Yeti Krab. The Yeti Krab sniffs the patties, eats them and is now fully satisfied with the meal he wanted.]
Mr. Krabs: Way to go, boy! He loves it! [The Yeti Krab pays Mr. Krabs with a dollar.] And look, he's a paying customer. [The Yeti Krab walks happily out of the Krusty Krab and heads back to the mountains.] Come back and see us anytime, Mr. Yeti Krab! [Mr. Krabs turns to SpongeBob and Squidward.] Hey, what are you two doing standing idle? Squidward, sweep out the crow's nest!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob takes a broom and runs.] Done! [Cuts to the outside of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Refinish me floors!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Done!
Mr. Krabs: Build me a new safe!
Squidward: Nuh-uh.
SpongeBob: Consider it done!
[The episode ends]


[The episode starts at Krusty Krab with Squidward snoring and muttering. SpongeBob, who is in the kitchen, takes an order from the order window, puts it in front of his face and scans it. He squeals and his eyeballs turn into Krabby Patties. He Throws the order down, goes to the freezer, opens the door, walks inside and gets a Krabby Patty between two pieces of paper; he brings it to the grill and removes the top piece of paper.]
SpongeBob: Ooh-wah! [He crumples up the piece of paper and throws it into the garbage can, which on the other side of the room. He puts the patty on the grill on the side that does not have paper on it. He removes the remaining piece of paper, crumples it up and throws it out the order window, where it bounces of Squidward's head, who is still sleeping, and lands in the garbage can next to him. The scene changes to SpongeBob powering up the Slice-O-Matic and splits himself into small naked SpongeBobs that jump into sink full of soapy water, so they can wash the dishes. After getting the job done, they all go to the grill (there is nine of them) where the real SpongeBob is reconstructed with his spatula in his hand.] Oh! [He flips the patty, puts the spatula in his pocket and flies through order window, waking up Squidward by taking his hat off.]
Squidward: Hmm? Who's that? [Puts his hat back and goes back to sleep.]
SpongeBob: [Lands on a beam where a bucket and a mop are prepared, ties rope to his hat, takes mop puts his head and does the victory screech. Jumps of the beam and mops floor while swinging across the Krusty Krab. He continues to mop the floor but this time he spins while leaving water tracks in a form of "Z" on the floor. He gets back on the beam.] Ah! [Takes spatula out of his pocket, leans himself off the beam again, he cuts the rope tied to his hat, he flies back to the kitchen through order window and takes a patty of the grill. He lands near a counter with containers with the Krabby Patty ingredients and makes two halves of a patty.] Hmm, something's missing. [Realizes what is missing and runs towards a cabinet with pickles and opens it. He picks which one it is and takes it.] Aha! June 15th. [He shakes the jar, opens the lid, slurps some of the pickle juice, evaluates it in his mouth, and returns it to the jar.] Fine month for pickles. [He goes back to the counter and adds two pickles and adds a slice of lettuce which was on the other side of the patty, he then connect both halves, he then exit from kitchen with the fully-made Krabby Patty] Order up! [He wakes Squidward and Squidward's hat falls off.] One perfect patty on a pristine plate in a squeaky-clean Krusty Krab. Man, oh, man, do I love my job! [Mr. Krabs taps him on the shoulder] Hey, Mr. Krabs. What's the good word?
Mr. Krabs: Well, actually, SpongeBob, uh, there's two words. And they're not very good. You're fired.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Oh, Mr.- [shouts] what?
Squidward: Fired?
Mr. Krabs: Well, you see, I've been doing some calculating and, you know, crunching the old numbers. And it turns out that I'll save a whole nickel if I cut your salary. Completely.
SpongeBob: [stammers] Bu-bu-bu-but how about if I work for free?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, I looked into that. Apparently, it's [makes air quotes] "illegal". And I'll lose my "vendor's license". Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Bill: Uh, excuse me. Is that mine?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Maybe. [Drops the plate and sniffs] Take it.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] You know I love you like a son. But you can't argue with a nickel.
SpongeBob: But--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but.
Squidward: Hey, what about me? Can I get fired too?
Mr. Krabs: I'm afraid not, Squidward. You've got seniority.
Squidward: Oh, yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Nope, it's gotta be you, son. You're canned. [Gives can to SpongeBob] Here's your pink slip. [Puts pink dress on SpongeBob] I'm giving you the ax. [Gives SpongeBob an ax. SpongeBob splits himself in half with it and returns to normal afterwards.] You're fired.
SpongeBob: [gasps, then bursts into tears] No, not that, anything but that! [Starts crying]
Mr. Krabs: So, uh, if you could just hand over your spatula. Um... I'll just take that. [Grunts while he tries to takes spatula out of SpongeBob's hand.]
SpongeBob: Here, I'll get that for you. [Takes his arm off]
Mr. Krabs: I'll also need the hat. Allow me. [Tries to take the hat of SpongeBob's head, but it is connected to SpongeBob's head, he succeeds with heavy resistance] Go ahead; take a moment to collect yourself. Long as you need. [Walks away]
[SpongeBob's tears flood the Krusty Krab and the register boat floats away.]
Old Man Jenkins: [sitting on the barrel] I'm not a very strong swimmer.
Squidward: [Comes over with a cranking hole maker and makes a hole in the floor and the tears drain through the hole. Walks away and comes back with a box carrier. He picks up SpongeBob with it.] Okay, that's enough. It's closing time. [He moves SpongeBob out of the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob stops crying] You know, it just won't be the same around here without you. You'll have to visit sometime... [Pushes SpongeBob off the box carrier and backs up through the Krusty Krab doors with it.] As a customer. [SpongeBob starts crying again. Squidward talks to him from the front door.] Buh-bye now. Sayonara. Good riddance. [He closes the door and walks past a window] Man, is it going to be sweet without that pest around! [He stops as he sees SpongeBob looking through the window while whimpering and Squidward lowers a "Krabby Patty" ad to hide him.] This day couldn't get any better. [Turns around and see Mr. Krabs] Well, Eugene, let me commend you on a terrific business decision. But now that SpongeBob's gone, who will be running the grill?
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, I'll have you know, [put SpongeBob's hat on the top of his eye stalks] I was five times "golden spatula" in the navy, [He holds up the spatula, still attached to SpongeBob's hand] so I'll be running the grill. [It catches on fire.] Ooh!
Squidward: I can smell the grease fires already.
[The scene changes to show nighttime, SpongeBob walking towards his house with head lowered.]
SpongeBob: [enters his house where Gary is waiting on the front door] Hey, Gary, I'm home. Forever. [Walks to his chair, lowers his head over the chair's arm and starts crying again.]
Gary: [Walks up to the chair] Meow meow? [translation: What's wrong?]
SpongeBob: [takes his head up] Oh, Mr. Krabs feels he doesn't need me anymore.
Gary: Meow. [translation: I need you, SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: What's that, Gary? You need me? Oh, the unconditional love of a pet. [Gary takes his food bowl and puts it on the chair's other arm] Oh, I'm sorry. Here I am wallowing in my misery, and it's past your dinnertime. [Gets off the chair's arm and walks to the cabinet, bows his head over the counter below it and sighs. Takes the can of Snail food out of the cabinet and uses a can opener to open it. He manages to get his arm tangled to the can] I used to feed everyone in Bikini Bottom. [He walks over to Gary and his food bowl] Now I just feed you. [He pours the snail food out of the can into Gary's food bowl. The can falls on the floor and SpongeBob's arm unwrapped as he leaves to sit on the chair. Gary brings SpongeBob's long arm and puts it over the chair's arm] Oh, thanks, Gary.
Gary: Meow. [translation: You're welcome.; Gary leaves]
SpongeBob: [takes remote] That's how I used to hold my spatula. [He jumps off the chair and gets on his knees and starts crying again. He stops when he hears a distant sobbing noise and then starts sobbing too. Stops when he hears distant sobbing again. He looks out his window to see it was Patrick. He walks over to the window.] Patrick, what's wrong?
Patrick: [stops sobbing] Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I heard you crying and it made me sad. [Both do a stifled crying]
SpongeBob: Gee, I'm sorry. Why don't you come inside?
Patrick: [enters by breaking through the wall] Hi, SpongeBob! Why are you making me so sad?
SpongeBob: Patrick, the most horrible thing happened today. I got-- f-f-f-f-f-f-f...
Patrick: Free French fries?
SpongeBob: F-f-f-f-f-f-f...
Patrick: Fried Frittatas?
SpongeBob: F-f-f-f-f-f-f...
Patrick: Frothy frappe?
SpongeBob: F-f-f-f...
Patrick: I can't think of any more food that starts with the letter "c", SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: It's not food, Patrick. I got fired.
Patrick: Hey, that's great! Being unemployed is the best gig I know! [He grabs SpongeBob's side] I tell you what. Meet me tomorrow morning, and I'll introduce you to the wonders of the unemployed lifestyle.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have to wor-- oh. Yeah, okay.
Patrick: [pats him on the head] Great. See you then. [Exits by breaking through another wall and leaves a hole behind.]
[SpongeBob sighs. "The Next Morning" time card appears on the screen. Scene changes to show Patrick walking towards SpongeBob's house while humming.]
Patrick: [Knocks on the front door. Lock starts to turn and the door slowly opens] Oh! [SpongeBob exits house with "Best Day Ever" cup and a 5:00 shadow. His shirt is messy and his tie is loose.] Hey, buddy! Are you ready? Ready for your first day of glorious unemployment? Or as I like to call it, "fun-employment"! [His eyebrows go up and down, to indicate, "Get it?"]
SpongeBob: Yeah, sure. [Slurps] Whatever.
Patrick: That's the spirit! [Leads SpongeBob out of his house] Now, the first stop on our tour of fun-employment is a healthy breakfast with our good friend Mr. Squidward. [Patrick is standing in his petunias and pointing at Squidward raking his garden] Hey, Squidward! How are you this fine morning? [Squidward starts growling angrily]
Squidward: [angrily] How many times do I have to tell you... Keep.. [Throws tomato] Off... [Throws cucumber] My... [Throws another tomato]... Petunias!!?!
Patrick: [has two tomatoes and cucumber arranged to form eyes and nose. Takes tomato, salts it, eats it, takes cucumber with his tongue, and eats it.] I'll just save this for later. [Puts tomato in his pants] Now you try.
SpongeBob: [still holding the "Best Day Ever" cup] Uh... [Stands in petunias as Patrick exits it while laughing.] Hey, Squidward. Look at me. I'm fun-employed! [Slams a basket full of vegetables on SpongeBob and rips apart his hat. SpongeBob slurps.]
Patrick: Hey, you're good at this. Next on our i-tin-er-ary, a brief mid-morning siesta. [He sticks himself to his rock.]
[SpongeBob takes the basket with vegetables off his head and uses Gary's slime to glue himself to the rock but it does not hold him long, so he falls off the rock.]
Gary: Meow.
[SpongeBob is leaned on Patrick's rock and Patrick is still glued to it.]
SpongeBob: [sighs deeply and then groans. sighs deeply and then groans. Tears a part of himself off, dips it into the coffee and eats it. The teared part grows back and then Patrick wakes up and walks over to SpongeBob.]
Patrick: [yawns] Are you feeling any better yet?
SpongeBob: [slurps] Uh-uh.
Patrick: Come on, SadPants. You know what always picks me up? [Picks SpongeBob up]
SpongeBob: [spills coffee] Nope.
Patrick: Free lunch with friends!
SpongeBob: [lifts cup in the air] Yippee.
[The scene changes to show the exterior of Sandy's Treedome where a sign saying "Volunteers Wanted, All You Can Eat!" has been put up. The scene zooms in to show Sandy with a clipboard and a pen and three volunteers (a fish, Patrick, and SpongeBob) at a table with bowls of unknown, orange, substance in front of them, each has a letter in front of them, the fish has "A", Patrick has "B", and SpongeBob has "C". SpongeBob and Volunteer A are holing spoons, and Patrick is hold a fork.]
Sandy: Okay, let's begin the experiment. [Volunteer A eats his sample and his head expands into the shape of a ball.] Mm-hmm. [Writes down some notes and walks to the Patrick] Okay, next.
Patrick: Oh, boy, lunch! [Puts his head into his sample and eats and a tiny Patrick grows on his forehead]
Patrick's Forehead: More! More! [Patrick gives him more]
Sandy: Very interesting. [Writes something down again and walks to SpongeBob] Okay, next. [Notices that it is SpongeBob] SpongeBob! I almost didn't recognize you. [Shows SpongeBob's face] You look awful! What are you doing with these here freeloaders?
SpongeBob: I got fired. Now I'm fun-employed. [Shakes his spoon in the air] Whoo-hoo. [He takes a spoonful of his sample and is about to eat it, but Sandy stops him.]
Sandy: Whoa, there. You do not want to eat that.
SpongeBob: Why? What is it?
Sandy: Heck if I know. [Whispering] this here's a psychological test to see how much weird gunk folks will eat... if it's free. [She walks over to a barrel with the radioactive sign on it and smoke coming from it. She stirs it and scoops up the content with a ladle] Who's for seconds?
Both Patricks: Me! [Sandy refills Patrick's bowl.]
Patrick: [takes a spoonful and gives it to tiny Patrick] Here you go, little buddy. [He chews it, swallows it and it falls onto Patrick's tongue. He swallows it.] Ahh. Mmm!
Sandy: SpongeBob, you're a mess. You're falling apart. [SpongeBob's brain with his eyes falls out of his head. Sandy picks it up.] Come on now, SpongeBob. You need to pull yourself together. Get some structure in your life. [Puts brain and eyes back into SpongeBob's head] What you need is a new job.
SpongeBob: You're right, Sandy. [Turns to Patrick] I'm afraid I can't do this anymore, Patrick. Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job.
Patrick's Forehead: Who do you think you're fooling, you loser? You couldn't keep a job if you tried!
Patrick: Hey! You can't talk to my friend like that! [Punches tiny Patrick into face]
Patrick's Forehead: Unh! [Groans]
Patrick: Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. You need to follow your heart.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick. [Put finger in the air] It's time to rejoin the workforce. Gainful employment, here I come! [He grunts and his 5:00 shadow disappear and his clothes become neat. He also looses the gunk in his eyes and his holes become their normal shape.] Yah! I'm ready! Whoo-hoo! [He walks away. The scene changes to show him walking down the street.] ♪I'm ready, I'm ready for a new job, for a new job, I'm ready for a new job; I'm ready♪ [He enters a restaurant called the "Weenie Hut".]
[The scene changes to show the interior of "Weenie Hut"]
SpongeBob: [He sees a man dressed in a weenie costume and talks to him.] Greetings, purveyor of elongated sausage products! I would love to work at your establishment.
Mr. Weiner: [dressed as weenie] Well, you do look enthusiastic. [Shows SpongeBob looking enthusiastically] Hmm. All right, kid. [He holds SpongeBob's side.] Let's see what you got. [They walk into the kitchen. SpongeBob now has a hot dog-shaped hat on.] So this is the kitchen.
SpongeBob: Hmm. [He goes to the grill and touches a button and it pops off and is hanging on a wire.] This grill is not in very good shape.
Mr. Weiner: Oh, we don't use the grill. [Points to the roller] We cook everything on the roller. [Shows roller with hot dogs rolling on it. SpongeBob screams] Good luck, kid. [Walks outside]
SpongeBob: [takes a hot dog off the roller and puts it in the bun] Hmm. There's something not quite right about this food, but I'm not sure what it is. [Gets an idea] Aha! [Slices the hot dog into pieces]
[The scene changes to Mr. Weiner waiting outside of the kitchen]
Mr. Weiner: [takes a golden box with three sausages out of his jacket, takes one out, closes the box, returns the box, smells the sausage, eats it and then burps. He turns to the kitchen door.] Hey! Where are those weenies? [SpongeBob slams him with the kitchen door while exiting with a plate of "weenie patties".]
SpongeBob: Your weenies, sir. [presents the plate of "weenie patties" to Mr. Weiner]
Mr. Weiner: What in the name of Davy Jones' gym shorts are these?
SpongeBob: They're weenie patties.
Mr. Weiner: What are you some kind of nut? You've ruined my weenies! [Throws the plate away] You're fired! [Throws SpongeBob's hat away]
SpongeBob: Aah! But, Mr. Krabs, why?
Mr. Weiner: Mr. Who?
SpongeBob: I mean, Mr. Wiener!
Mr. Weiner: Just go. [SpongeBob leaves]
SpongeBob: [outside] Well that was a setback. [Shows him heading to the "Pizza Piehole"] Hello, Pizza Piehole!
[The Scene changes to show the inside of "Pizza Piehole" where a fish is dressed in a pizza costume]
Pizza Pete: [throws pizza dough in the air and it ends up on the fan]
SpongeBob: [from behind] Excuse me, Mr. Pizza man. [Approaches] You need a fry-cook? [Pizza dough falls on the fish]
Pizza Pete: [removes part of dough blocking his view] Oh, boy, do I! Can you make pizza? [Hands him the dough]
SpongeBob: [takes dough] Eh... probably. [Stretches dough, throws in into the air and starts spinning it on his pointer finger]
Pizza Pete: Oh, that's amazing. [Shakes SpongeBob's hand] Congratulations, you're hired.
SpongeBob: Cool. [Walks to the oven while still spinning the dough on his finger, put it on the kitchen board and then in the oven] Well, it's no Krabby Patty, but... perhaps I'll find contentment.
Pizza Pete: [wiping the table] Hey, buddy, how's the pizza coming?
SpongeBob: Almost done! But I did change the recipe a bit.
Pizza Pete: [laughs] No problem. [Bell dings] A few extra toppings never hurt anyone. [SpongeBob approaches with "Pizza Patty"] Huh? What have you done? [Shows Pizza Patty] You've turned an innocent pizza into... a pizza patty! It's an abomination!
SpongeBob: Yeah, of deliciousness!
Pizza Pete: You're fired!
SpongeBob: But who'll make the Krabby Patties?
Pizza Pete: Krabby Patties? What do you think this is, the Krusty Krab? [Holding SpongeBob's leg, he drops SpongeBob on the ground outside of the restaurant]
SpongeBob: [gets up and cleans dirt off himself.] Like I need his dumb job, anyway. I hope his pepperoni falls off. [Enters "Taco Sombrero"] Hey, taco man, may I have a job, por favor?
Senor Taco: [dressed in a taco costume] Hmm. All right. Let's see what you can do with a burrito.
SpongeBob: [enters kitchen "in" door, we hear some noises inside and he then exits through the kitchen "out" door with "Burrito Patty" in a bun] How about that?
Senor Taco: [takes "Burrito Patty"] Interesting. It's some sort of "burrito patty". Hmm. [turns to customers] Who'd like to taste it?
Pilar: I'll give it a go! [Takes burrito patty, tries to bite it and ends up squeezing its content to Frank and Billy]
Senor Taco: You're fired!
SpongeBob: [starts whimpering] But I've given you the best years of my life, Mr. Krabs! [Cries while holding Senor Taco's feet]
Senor Taco: Get to stepping!
SpongeBob: [He cries while going from "Taco Sombrero" to "Wet Noodle". Some crashing is heard once he gets inside.]
Noodleman: [dressed as Chinese Takeout box. He carries SpongeBob out.] You're fired! [Kicks SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Aah! [Lands in dirt]
Noodleman: [shows "Noodle Patty"] And take your noodle patty with you! [Throws it at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [Noodle Patty splashes his face] Oh, I'll take it, all right. I'll take it to go! Home.
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob walking towards his house with his head lowered. He passes both Patrick and Squidward's houses.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] For years I worked at the Krusty Krab. Now I've been fired five times in one day. [Enters his house] Who are you going to cook for now, SpongeBob?
Gary: [approaches] Meow.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, you must be starving. [Takes Gary to the kitchen] Don't worry gare-bear. [Goes towards the cabinet] I'll open up a can of Snailpo for you. [Opens cabinet and see there is nothing in there] Oh, no. [Turns to Gary] We're all out of Snailpo. [Walks away] We'll just have to make our own. [Opens fridge takes some vegetables out of it and closes the fridge with his foot. Takes the vegetables to kitchen counter, chops them with his hands, carries them to a pot, and puts them in that pot. Whistles while it's cooking and then takes a wooden spoon to mix the contents until it starts boiling. Tastes what's on the spoon.] Perfect! [Takes the pot, leaves it on kitchen counter, he takes can, and puts the pot's contents in it.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob painting "Snailpo" and its logo on a piece of paper]
SpongeBob: [glues the label that he made to the can, put the lid on it and hits the can with a mallet, so that the lid can settle. He presents it to Gary] One homemade can of Snailpo! [Uses can opener to open it, pours snail's food into Gary's food bowl and throws the can into trash on the other side of the room.]
Gary: [eats satisfactorily] Meow.
SpongeBob: [leans towards Gary] What's that, Gary? It's the best food you've ever had?
Gary: Meow.
[Scene expands to show Patrick eating food from different food bowl and still having tiny Patrick on his forehead.]
Patrick: [raises his head] Yeah, this is dee-licious! Does it have any side effects?
SpongeBob: [stands up] Only satisfaction. [Sighs] If only my bosses liked my cooking as much as you two do. [Looks at tiny Patrick] I mean three. [Someone knocks on the door. Goes towards the front door and opens it to see that nobody is there.] Hello. Hmm. That's odd. I could've sworn I heard a knock at the door. [Two fish dressed in hot dog costumes puts him between two big buns. SpongeBob yells while being muffled.]
[The Hot Dog Minions takes him to "Weenie Hut" where Mr. Weiner handcuffs SpongeBob's right hand to pipe and SpongeBob's left hand to hot dog tongs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Weenie?
Mr. Weiner: Congratulations, SpongeBob, you've been promoted.
SpongeBob: But you just fired me.
Mr. Weiner: That's mustard under the bun, my boy. The important thing is my customers love your little sliders. [Shows "Weenie Patty"] Now get to work!
SpongeBob: [rises handcuffed hand] I'm pretty sure this is illegal. What am I gonna do now?
Pizza Pete: [from the background] Pst! [shows him in the shadow] Hey, kid. You need help out of here? [Leans out of the shadow]
SpongeBob: Pizza Pete! Yes, please. That wiener has me chained to the grill, [Pizza Pete approaches him] and he really seems to be relishing it.
Pizza Pete: I have something to free you. [Takes pizza sauce out]
SpongeBob: Pizza sauce? [Pizza Pete puts the pizza sauce on both handcuffs] I'm free!
Pizza Pete: Great! Now you can get to my grill. [Takes bread stick out]
SpongeBob: What? [Pizza Pete ties his hands with the breadstick] Parmesan-crusted breadstick! [Pizza Pete takes him] Whoa!
Mr. Weiner: [from the kitchen door] Hey! Where are you going with my fry cook?
[Cuts SpongeBob being carried by Pizza Pete and screaming]
Noodleman: [takes SpongeBob with chopsticks and laughs while being on the roof] I'll take one fry-cook to go! [He jumps off the roof and laughs again after landing. Señor Taco opens the door next to him and sends him away]
SpongeBob: [lands] Oh, thank you, Señor Taco! [Señor Taco grabs him with his suit] Oh, no! Not you too! [He screams while Señor Taco carries him]
Pizza Pete, Mr. Weiner and Noodleman: [Señor Taco runs into them] Get him! [They jump on Señor Taco]
[Fight starts and smoke covers the screen that soon disappears to show all four of them stretching SpongeBob by pulling each of his limbs]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Noodleman: Let go!
Mr. Weiner: He's mine!
Senor Taco: I was here first!
Pizza Pete: No, I was!
[Scene expands to show someone in a Krabby Patty costume on the roof.]
Krabby Patty Man: Stop! Unhand that sponge! [Jumps on Pizza Pete and punches him away. Takes Señor Taco and destroys his costume by gobbling it. Señor Taco runs away embarrassed.]
Noodleman: [drops SpongeBob] It's the Killer Patty! [Gets noodles squeezed out of his costume by Krabby Patty Man]
Mr. Weiner: [Krabby Patty Man walks towards him and he drops SpongeBob before he gets to him] Here, take him! Just don't hurt me. [Whimpers with eyes closed. Opens eyes to see that Krabby Patty Man is gone and sighs. Starts humming while crossing the street and is hit by a bus] Aah!
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob waking up]
SpongeBob: [opens eyes] Krabby Patty! You saved me! [Krabby Patty Man starts carrying him] Well, here we go again.
[Krabby Patty Man carries him to the Krusty Krab and walks past John, Blue Fred, and Thaddeus exiting it. Smokes comes out of the Krusty Krab when John opens the front door]
John: Ugh! This place is terrible!
Blue Fred: The Krusty Krab has really gone downhill.
[As they get inside Krabby Patty Man puts SpongeBob down. Krusty Krab is a mess and there is smoke coming through the order window]
Nat Peterson: [holding burned Krabby Patty] How can you serve this slop? [Throws it on the floor] I'm never eating here again! [Leaves]
Mr. Krabs: [holding spatula in his hand and exiting the kitchen with one burnt eyebrow.] Wait! Come back! [Drops spatula] That was me last customer. [SpongeBob and Krabby Patty Man approach] SpongeBob? [Takes SpongeBob and lifts him.] Squidward, you found him!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward?
Squidward: [takes Krabby Patty costume off] I'm afraid so. [Kicks costume and leans hand towards SpongeBob] SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?
Squidward: You know I hate you, right?
SpongeBob: Yes. [Smiles and takes Squidward's "arm" tentacle] Yes, I do.
Squidward: Well, I hate the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more. [Gets on his knee and takes SpongeBob's hands] Please come back and be the fry cook again. [Lets SpongeBob hands go]
SpongeBob: [turns to Mr. Krabs] Well, if it's okay with you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, laddy. [Takes SpongeBob] I shoulda never let you go. The Krusty Krab has fallen apart without you. You're rehired, boy.
SpongeBob: [turns to Squidward who is still on knees] All right! Now my life has purpose again! [Turns away] Let's get this place cleaned up. [Jumps on the beam where bucket and mop are prepared and his hat already tied to the rope. Does the victory screech, jumps of the beam and cleans everything while swinging; including giving Mr. Krabs brand new suit and Squidward a brand new pink dress and crown.]
Squidward: Hmm. [examines dress] Not exactly my color.
SpongeBob: [cuts the rope tied to his hat, flies back to the kitchen through order window, takes patty off the grill and exits through the kitchen door with the Krabby Patty on the plate.] The Krusty Krab is back in business!
[The scene changes to show a line in front of the Krusty Krab where people are cheering. The scene changes again to inside of Krusty Krab where customers are eating; including Senor Taco, Pizza Pete, Noodleman, The Hot Dog minions, and Mr. Weiner.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, it looks like things are back to normal. And to make up for that extra nickel I was losing, I installed a pay toilet. [Shows Old Man Jenkins holding a purse looking for a nickel for the pay toilet]
Old Man Jenkins: [hopping] Oh, dear, where is that nickel? [Shows SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs laughing] Huh? Why are you laughing?


[We see Squidward's house at sunrise. The sun comes up. A scallop crows like a rooster]
Squidward: [singing his vintage, "la-da-dee, la-da-do, la-da-dum] 20 minutes in the bath seems like enough. [has wrinkly hands] [sighs in excitement] Another day! [groans] Another day.
SpongeBob: [falls down the stairs like in "Missing Identity"] Ready for work! [walks to Squidward] Good morning, Squidward, I'm... [spots he's still wearing his underwear] [gasps] Not ready for work! [falls up the stairs]
Squidward: Whatever.
SpongeBob: [runs up to Squidward] Thanks for waiting, Squidward.
Squidward: I wasn't waiting.
SpongeBob: [laughs] I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants.
Squidward: Yes, I saw that.
SpongeBob: I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?
Squidward: Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!
SpongeBob: I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut! [Squidward stops moving] [SpongeBob gasps] Squidward, what are you doing?! [SpongeBob tries to get Squidward to move, and falls onto the ground trying to do so]
Squidward: SpongeBob, look. [pointing to the Krusty Krab] We're walking in a straight line.
SpongeBob: I don't follow.
Squidward: A straight line is the shortest distance between any two points!
SpongeBob: Speak English, brainiac! [laughs]
Squidward: Well, see, you have point A [draws a red A in the sky], where you start, and then there's point... [Squidward draws curved lines in the sky] point...[erasing everything he wrote] I don't even know what I'm talking about!
SpongeBob: [the A falls on SpongeBob's tongue] Mmm, strawberry!
[bubble transition] [SpongeBob looks down on his clock]
SpongeBob's Clock: Tick!
SpongeBob: Oh no, now we're only going to be 14 minutes early for work! [running in circles frantically] Oh, there's got to be a shortcut around here somewhere!
Squidward: Oh, for the last time [drawing the straight line again] straight line, point A, there's no shortcut!
SpongeBob: There is always a shortcut!
Squidward: What moron told you that?
Patrick: [walking by] There's always a shortcut!
Squidward: [Realizing Patrick told SpongeBob that statement] Huh.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob puts on an explorer hat] Squidward, I am going to find that shortcut!
Squidward: Look, the Krusty Krab is right at the end of the block!
[exterior shot of the Krusty Krab with Mr. Krabs outside]
Mr. Krabs: Yoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're not going to come with me?
Squidward: No, SpongeBob. I'm just going to struggle through the rest of this walk, alone.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess this is where we part ways. But I can't wait to see your face when you get to work and I'm already there! [laughs] That's the face! That's the look! [laughs as Squidward walks to the Krusty Krab] [SpongeBob runs off the road to find the "shortcut"] [singing while going through many landmarks] First you do a zig, then you take a little zag, that's how find you a shortcut! Crawl underneath the fence, struggle through a bush, and that's how you find a shortcut! [notices Squidward] Huh?
Squidward: Straight line, point A to point B. You're still not getting it.
SpongeBob: Oh, tartar sauce! Maybe I should've zagged when I zigged! [singing again, going through more landmarks] First you do a zag, crawl underneath the fence, then you take a little zig, that's how you find a shortcut! [laughs] There, that's better. [SpongeBob notices he's in a darker part of town] [laughs nervously] Now this is what I call a real great shortcut. Now all I have to do is remember my wilderness training so I don't get lost! [SpongeBob imagines of what Sandy said to him]
Sandy: [in a thought bubble] First rule of wilderness training, is map out your course, by taking note of local landmarks!
[SpongeBob's imagination bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Local landmarks... [SpongeBob looks left and right spotting local landmarks] A-ha! [pointing to a large and unusual shell] Right at this large and unusual shell. [the creature under the shell emerges and walks away] Right at this abandoned sofa, and jog left at the broken fire hydrant. [SpongeBob spots what appears to be the sign to the Krusty Krab] There it is, the Krusty Krab! [SpongeBob climbs over the fence to see it]
[the scene transitions to the real Krusty Krab, where we see various still images of the inside of the restaurant until we see Squidward relaxing]
Squidward: Ahhhh.... [Mr. Krabs appears]
Mr. Krabs: Well, look at this. Lazing about. [in a mocking voice] Can I get you anything else, another pillow, maybe? A cappuccino machine?
Squidward: No thanks, I got one! [Squidward pours himself a mug of cappuccino with an image of his face in it] Perfect. No customers. No SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause.
[the scene transitions back to SpongeBob, where SpongeBob finds what he thinks is the Krusty Krab. He comes right up to it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Krabby Krust?! [SpongeBob notices a guy painting signs] Is that the name of a restaurant?
Sal: No, it's a typo.
SpongeBob: Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?
Sal: Never heard of it.
SpongeBob: Oh, you should try it! It's the best place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom! [SpongeBob hands the fish coupons] Here, take these coupons!
Sal: Thanks! I'm going to go there right now! [the fish hands his paintbrush to SpongeBob and drives away in his truck]
SpongeBob: I thought you didn't know where the Krusty Krab was! Oh, what do I do now? [cries] [SpongeBob imagines Sandy again, who is hammering a tent to the ground. When Sandy talks to him, SpongeBob stops crying]
Sandy: [in thought bubble] Remember, your landmarks!
[SpongeBob's imagination bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money! [SpongeBob goes back the way he came] Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came... [running in circles] I'm lost! [screams, until he spots the broken fire hydrant he previously saw] Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant! [sits down near the hydrant] Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant! [SpongeBob notices many broken fire hydrants] So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out. [sees a payphone] Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone. [walks to it] Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it. [shakes himself upside down; a dime falls out] My last dime. [picks up phone] I hope this works. [puts dime in coin slot. The cash register phone rings at the Krusty Krab. Squidward groans and answers it]
Squidward: Krusty Krab. May I reluctantly help you?
SpongeBob: It's me, Squidward. SpongeBob. I'm calling from the payphone.
Squidward: You don't say. How's that shortcutting going?
SpongeBob: Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?! [beep from the phone]
Operator: If you'd like to continue this call, please insert another dime.
SpongeBob: I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?
Operator: If you'd like to know where you are, please insert another dime.
SpongeBob: Uh, hold on! [SpongeBob runs to the abandoned sofa, where three tough-looking fish are sitting on it drinking sodas (the main one sitting in the center, Scott, resembles Harold). He digs his hands under the cushions, and finds two nickels] Two nickels! I need a dime! Oh, I'm never going to get to work!
Scott: What are ya doing?
SpongeBob: Looking for a dime in this abandoned sofa!
Scott: This is our abandoned sofa, pal!
[Scott and the fish to the left of him, who resembles Scooter, give off mean looks to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: What ya doing there, drinking soda?
Scott: What's it tooya!
SpongeBob: Isn't it a little early to be hitting the high-fructose corn-syrup?
Scott: [he and the fish to the right of him, who resembles Charlie, give off surprised looks. Scott gets off the sofa and approaches SpongeBob] Hey, listen! I know this gigantic soda isn't good for me, but sometimes it gives me the kick I need to start my busy day as a pedicab driver!
SpongeBob: Ooh, you drive a pedicab?
Scott: Yes, sir! [Scott puts on a pedicab driver's hat and grabs his pedicab, which SpongeBob gets into] You need a ride somewhere?
SpongeBob: Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it! [Scott drives away]
Scooter: Way to go, Scott!
Charlie: Yeah, he's almost saved enough to attend a community college next year! [he and Scooter clench their soda together and continue to drink them]
[Scott drops SpongeBob off at what appears to be the Krusty Krab again]
SpongeBob: [gets off of the pedicab] Thanks a lot, Scott! Stay in school! [SpongeBob notices the sign] Krusty Klam?! [gasps] Wait, Scott, come back! [Scott drives away, leaving SpongeBob behind] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob begins frantically running, and checks his clock]
SpongeBob's Clock: Tock!
SpongeBob: No! Over the cliff! [jumps off the cliff into the muck] Through the toxic runoff! [runs through a sewer pipe] Make a right at the disease-filled sewer pipe! [SpongeBob slides out of the sewer pipe] Face-first into this fetid muck! Over the garbage pile! Fall down this mountain of broken glass! Over the excruciatingly sharp razor-wire! [SpongeBob falls down with wires attached to him] Up this massive hill! [SpongeBob grows so tired he falls down flat on his face] That's...the Krusty Krab! And I'm still 2 minutes early! [SpongeBob crawls his way to the Krusty Krab] [SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab]I made it! I made it! [SpongeBob hugs two customers] Oh, random Krusty Krab patrons! How I've missed out! [SpongeBob jumps onto an old fish's lap and kisses her] Oh, how I've missed your youthful faces! [the scene then cuts to outside the bathroom with SpongeBob in it] I missed the bathroom, too! [two fish come running out screaming] [SpongeBob approaches a fish choking on his Krabby Patty] But most of all, I missed you, choking guy! [SpongeBob hugs the choking fish who spits out his chewed-up Krabby Patty, which lands on Patrick's Krabby Patty] [SpongeBob notices Patrick] Patrick? How did you get here?
Patrick: Same way I always do. Scott gave me a ride in his pedicab. [Scott, in his pedicab, appears outside and winks]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob notices Squidward] Squidward! Squidward, can you believe I made it?! [Old Man Jenkins appears to be hanging from the razor-wires on SpongeBob, and groans]
Squidward: Congratulations. [Mr. Krabs appears]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, boy?! You're scaring all me customers with your foul stench!
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [pushes SpongeBob off of him] Oh no, lad, you're not coming in here looking like that! [shot of SpongeBob looking like a wreck] You're going straight home for a nice long bubble bath! [Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob outside]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir!
Squidward: What?! He gets to go home and take a bubble bath?! That's my thing!
Mr. Krabs: Yes it is. And consequently, you are just neat as a pin! Now get to work!
Squidward: I'm as neat as a pin? I'll show you neat as a pin! [Squidward runs outside, and gets himself dirty by rolling in dirt, ripping off his shirt, and pouring dirt on his head] Where's my bubble bath, Mr. Krabs?! [Mr. Krabs sprays Squidward with a hose]
Mr. Krabs: There you go! [a truck passes by and drives over a puddle, spraying Squidward, who is already laying in the puddle, with more water] Now get to work! [Sal exits out of his truck]
Sal: Uh, you guys open? I have coupons! "Buy one, get one free!"
Mr. Krabs: Oh no! It says "Buy one for a fee!"
Sal: Oh! I stand corrected! [Mr. Krabs and Sal walk off-screen, leaving Squidward in the puddle, as the episode ends]


Mr. Krabs: [scene starts at Krusty Krab] [to Nat] And how is everything for you today, sir?
Nat: Oh, it's great! Just great!
Mr. Krabs: Fine, fine.
Nat: I just love this Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, okay, always nice to hear. [starts walking away]
Nat: My Krabby Patty is a Krabby Patty and both buns are also Krabby Patties! [Krabs suddenly stops walking, eyes widen] So luxurious!
Mr. Krabs: [runs back, takes the patty from Nat, and looks at it as his pupil turn into dollar signs] You must've paid five times the price of a regular patty for that!
Nat: No extra. It's the same low price as a regular Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [pupil dollar signs rip] Argh! [faints. Squidward sprinkles salt on him and he screams] Me eyes! What are you doing, Mr. Squidward?! [Squidward sprinkles more salt on him and he screams again]
Squidward: I couldn't find a smelling salt, so I just used table salt.
Fred: Hey, my Krabby Patty is just a bun! And the two buns... are also buns. Stale buns.
Tom: [teary-eyed] My patty tastes like sadness.
Mr. Krabs: All right, that's enough. Patties with emotional flavors... [gets up, grunting] ...it's two bits extra. Now pay at the register. What in Davy Jones' locker is going on in here, Mr. Squidward?!
Squidward: What do you think? SpongeBob's in one of his moods. He failed his boating exam...again.
Mr. Krabs: Well, we can't have that. He's me best employee. Well, no offense.
Squidward: None taken.
Mr. Krabs: Melancholy and self-doubt are bad for business. Make a note of it. [walks to the kitchen]
Squidward: Let me grab a pencil. [to himself] Ha, it's funny, cause I mean the opposite. Ha.
[there are patties, covered in condiments, smushed in the window. SpongeBob is sobbing, lying on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: [enters] Avast there, lad! [steps on SpongeBob's foot, causing him to stand up] You're wasting your valuable tears, salting me patties with grief.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. [sniffles] Oh, I can't even cry right! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: There, there. Failing your driver's test is nothing to cry over.
SpongeBob: Oh, I've been in driving school as long as I can remember, and I still don't have my license!
Mr. Krabs: How much do they charge you at this driving school of yours?
SpongeBob: [stops crying] Oh, about $100 a semester.
Mr. Krabs: $100 a semester?! [pupils again turn into dollar signs] Well, I can do it for double the price and half the time!
SpongeBob: [happily] Really?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, I taught me own daughter Pearl how to drive like a little angel.
[Pearl drives through the kitchen, moving the grill and the vat of grease from its spot, all while putting on makeup]
Pearl: Hi, Daddy! I need money for shoes.
Mr. Krabs: Sure, anything for me little angel Pearl. [gives Pearl money from his wallet]
Pearl: Thanks, Daddy! [drives out of the kitchen, leaving a hole in the other wall]
[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs in a driving boat]
SpongeBob: Uh, are you sure about this, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Why, I couldn't be sure, lad. You don't need a... [air quotes] "professional" to teach you how to drive.
SpongeBob: You know, Mr. Krabs, at boating school, Mrs. Puff...
Mr. Krabs: Wipe that boating school malarkey out of your mind, son! It's all a racket.
SpongeBob: [gasps in shock] It is?
Mr. Krabs: [points to SpongeBob] And that goes for every kind of schooling. Why, there ain't nothing truly important, you can't learn on the streets with half a jigger of common sense and your own two claws. Now, put 'er in gear!
SpongeBob: [gives a thumbs-up] Okay! [starts the boat, but then accidentally reverses it, destroying the Krusty Krab sign]
Mr. Krabs: [nervously chuckles] Well, rookie mistake, boy. It happens all the time.
SpongeBob: It does?
Mr. Krabs: No, but you got the right fire in your belly.
SpongeBob: I do?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Yeah. Well, you know, what we need is a change of venue.
[bubble transition to the Mr. Krabs driving the boat in an empty parking lot]
Mr. Krabs: This empty parking lot is just the ticket. [parks the boat] Like every young person, the novice boater needs plenty of open, obstacle-free space and the freedom to make mistakes. [switches places with SpongeBob, making him the driver and Mr. Krabs the passenger]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you're so wise.
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles before putting his seatbelt on] Can't disagree with you there. All right, put 'er in gear! [SpongeBob again quickly reverses the boat, destroying the Krusty Krab entrance] Hmm.
SpongeBob: Rookie mistake, right?
Mr. Krabs: I suppose so. Now slowly inch forward and we'll check out the damage.
SpongeBob: Inch, inch. Inch, inch, inch. Inch, inch. [does so, but doesn't notice an anchor in the back, destroying the whole front of the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [checks his mirrors] Oh, broken wall. That's about $15,000. Oh, kitchen fire. Oh, that'll be about 6 grand. [sees Squidward hitting a customer, Harold, with a spatula] Ooh, lawsuit? Oh, that's a lot of zeroes! Ugh. [his eyes deflate, but they quickly return back to normal] [thinking in his head] All right, Krabs. Get a hold of yourself. You've been in worse fixes than this. Why, you've stared down the cannon's mouth, haven't ya? Look at that face. [sees SpongeBob's smile] Bleah! Is this the face of your final defeat? Is it, Krabs? [sees SpongeBob's smile more creepy, while also heavily breathing]
[bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's house driveway]
Mr. Krabs: Now, here's a place you should be comfortable with.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'll say.
Mr. Krabs: Just take a look around, boy-o: home sweet home. Nothing to make you twitchy and jumpy. Oh, just the opposite, in fact. A place so soothing and sweet, like a mother's gentle lullaby on a soft summer's night. [sees SpongeBob asleep with covers and Beary the teddy bear before waking him up with the horn] Oh, brother. Let's start with something simple: a little trip down the street to Patrick's house. [starts buckling his seatbelt, until...]
SpongeBob: Patrick's house! [crashes into Patrick's house, flipping Mr. Krabs off the boat and makes a crash landing into the Krusty Krab]
Harv: [steps over Mr. Krabs] I'll have one Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: Okay.
Mr. Krabs: [to Squidward] Upsell!
Squidward: [sighs] [to Harv] Would you like fries with that?
Harv: Yeah, sounds good.
Mr. Krabs: [to Squidward] Better.
[bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's driveway]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, that was just fine, but next time, wait until I say, "Put 'er into gear." [opens the passenger door, but after he said "put 'er into gear," SpongeBob drives the car away from Mr. Krabs, causing the passenger door to come off the boat. SpongeBob then crashes into the Krusty Krab again. The boat is on top of a destroyed table]
Squidward: You missed one. [the engine of the boat falls off it and destroys a before unbroken table]
[bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's driveway]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] A simple trip to Patrick's house: a line so straight and true.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, let's just leave the boat here and walk.
Mr. Krabs: Well, we, you know, we could do that. But you can't learn to drive without a boat. [gets an idea] Or can ye?
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob at the arcade]
Mr. Krabs: You'll certainly learn the way of the boat with this here top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art technological simulator.
[shot shows SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs standing in front of a driving arcade game]
Mr. Krabs: Now hand me one of them tokens. [SpongeBob takes out a token. Mr. Krabs inserts it in the coin slot. The game turns on. SpongeBob sits in the seat] You'll need your protective headgear. [Mr. Krabs puts a helmet with goggles on SpongeBob]
Computer on Screen: Ready? Drive!
[the screen shows pixelated SpongeBob driving a boat to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: I'm doing it, Mr. Krabs! I'm driving the boat! [the screen shows The Krusty Krab spproaching SpongeBob] Uh-oh. [brakes and a crash are heard. SpongeBob puts up his googles and sees that the arcade game has crashed into the top of the real-life Krusty Krab]
Computer on Screen: Sixth place! [the arcade game falls in the Krusty Krab]
[bubble transition to the boat parked on the road again. A worker goes down a ladder while fixing the broken Krusty Krab, when SpongeBob drives into the Krusty Krab sign, breaking it. The worker climbs back up the ladder. Bubble transition to SpongeBob driving the boat yet again]
SpongeBob: Hey, look, Mr. Krabs. I'm driving!
Mr. Krabs: Great job, boy. [gasps as the boat goes up a ramp and crashes into the Krusty Krab sign, which flips the boat into the Krusty Krab, destroying it yet again]
[bubble transition to the boat now going through a pipe on the roof of the Krusty Krab, then smashing its doors, while the worker hammers the roof]
Worker: Phew. [the boat crashes on the worker]
[bubble transition to the boat breaking a "One Way" sign as Mr. Krabs gasps, then screams with SpongeBob as SpongeBob drives the wrong way on the road, avoiding other boats and a gasoline truck. The boat then goes out of control for a few seconds before stopping on the road again]
SpongeBob: Well, at least I didn't hit the Krusty Krab that time. [chuckles nervously. The scene cuts to the other boats that were avoiding Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob crashing into the Krusty Krab, including the gasoline truck exploding the Krusty Krab with Squidward left standing]
[bubble transition to the worker giving Mr. Krabs a bill until SpongeBob crashes into the Krusty Krab once more and the worker then increases the bill]
Mr. Krabs: Saw that coming.
[bubble transition to a sad SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. The fire in my belly has gone... [imitates explosion]]
Mr. Krabs: No, no. It's my fault. We've been going about this all wrong, boy. It's not a pampering you'd be needing. It's a bold and reckless display of confidence!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
Mr. Krabs: You think when I was your age, I tip-toed around like a tadpole on a petunia?
SpongeBob: You never!
Mr. Krabs: That's right. My style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping. [snaps his claws]
SpongeBob: [while snapping his fingers] Snapping!
[bubble transition to a busy highway with many signs around]
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh.
Mr. Krabs: Thar she blows. The dreaded double roundabout, the most treacherous stretch of road in all of Bikini Bottom. To your starboard, you yield. To your port, they yield to you. And when you're in the middle, it's every man for himself and the devil take the rest!
SpongeBob: [shocked] Man, I don't think I'm ready for this, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [hugs SpongeBob] Nonsense, boy-o. All it takes is some confidence and a little coordination. Why, your little pet snail could do it. [puts Gary on the steering wheel]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Uh, I thought you were just using Gary as a colorful example, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, he's colorful, all right. But he's also going to teach you how to drive. Now, go! [Gary drives on the roundabout successfully, watching a lot of signs, while SpongeBob covers his eyes] Atta boy! [after a few seconds, Gary pulls over] There you go, SpongeBob. Did you see how Gary did that?
SpongeBob: [opens his eyes] Uh, yeah, some of it.
Mr. Krabs: Buck up, me boy-o. [points to SpongeBob] It's your turn next.
SpongeBob: [happily] My turn? Gee, Mr. Krabs, you must really believe in me.
Mr. Krabs: [while he and SpongeBob get out of the boat] Not really.
[a police motorcycle stops by the boat]
Police officer: Sir, is this your vehicle?
Mr. Krabs: Why, yes. Yes, officer, it is.
Police officer: And did I just see you let a snail negotiate this vehicle through a dangerous intersection?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] You sure did...uh, I mean, you didn't...I mean, well, no...I mean, well, yes...I mean, uh, look, it was just a friendly, little example: a colorful example. [pats SpongeBob] I was teaching the lad to drive.
Police officer: By putting a snail behind the wheel.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Officer, I don't have the boating handbook with me, but...
Mr. Krabs: [interrupts SpongeBob] Quiet, boy! Let me handle this.
Police officer: Are you a licensed driving instructor, sir?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Well, no. But I taught me own little girl to drive, you see, and you understand. Do you have any kiddies of your own at home, officer?
Police officer: [while writing on a piece of paper] No, I'm married to my job.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. Well, um...you two seem very happy together.
Police officer: Well, we've had our ups and downs, but after some couples counseling, we think we've worked out our issues. [continues writing on the paper]
Mr. Krabs: [looks at a smiling SpongeBob] This ticket's coming out of your paycheck, boy.
SpongeBob: [happily] Whoa! My first real traffic ticket.
Police officer: [to Mr. Krabs] Oh, this is going to require something more than money, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Ha! What could be worse than spending money? [looks at the written paper, then gasps]
[scene cuts to Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
Mrs. Puff: All right, class. Please say hello to our newest classmate...Mr. Krabs!
Class [except SpongeBob]: Hello, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [whispers to Mr. Krabs] Don't worry, Mr. K. I'll show you the ropes.
[episode ends]


[The episode starts with the camera panning in on Squidward's house.  Squidward arranges living room for a dinner while scatting, the oven dings and his cookies are done. Squidward smells the aroma of the freshly-baked cookies. He then goes into his living room and sets the pan of four, neatly organized, pieces of pointed toast on his coffee table then removes his oven mitts. A few clams grab his apron and carry it away. Then, the door bell rings.]
Squidward: Huh? [growls angrily]
[Squidward opens the door and sees no one]
SpongeBob: Hey.
[camera pans down showing SpongeBob standing at the door, smiling]
SpongeBob: Whatcha doing?
Squidward: I'm busy.
SpongeBob: How busy would you say you are on a scale of eight to nine?
Squidward: [angry] Fourteen!
SpongeBob: Squidward, I'm no mathematologist, but that sounds like a lot!
Squidward: [gets in SpongeBob's face] It is!
[SpongeBob's face pops back in place.]
SpongeBob: Okay, quick survey. Are you busy busy, or just busy?
Squidward: What's "busy busy?"
[SpongeBob opens his mouth to speak, but Squidward shuts his mouth with his hand.]
Squidward: No, no, no, no, no! Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Don't tell me anything, don't even tell me what you're doing here!
SpongeBob: [in a singing tone] I found a jump rope!
Squidward: [angry] I said not to tell me! [calmly] You're ruining my perfect afternoon. I'm spending some quality time with someone who's very important to me.
SpongeBob: Oh! Who's the lucky...
[Squidward slams the door in SpongeBob's face.]
Squidward: [sighs; spreads butter on toast] Perfectly brown toast points. [pours kelp juice in glass]  Sparkling kelp juice. [raises glass and looks in his reflection]  Here's to me! [doorbell rings] D'oh! That simpering buffoon!
Squidward's reflection In glass: You have a great vocabulary.
Squidward: I know.
Squidward's reflection: Indubitably.
[Squidward puts down glass, slams door open, Norton the mailfish is there.]
Squidward: [angry] Go away!
[Norton starts crying.]
Norton: Okay. [starts walking away]
Squidward: Wait. I thought you were some other idiot.
Norton: No. I guess I'm just this idiot.
[Norton hands Squidward an envelope. Norton excitedly waits for Squidward to open it. He doesn't open it for about 10 seconds at first, but then opens it. A pop-up picture of Bikini Bottom opens out of a card that Squidward opens again.]
Norton: Why, it's beautiful.
[Squidward slams card closed and reads the front.]
Squidward: "You are cordially invited to the fanciest and shmansiest artistic event of the season: The opening of Galleria Diphtheria." Oh, I've heard of that! "Bikini Bottom's most exclusive fine arts showcase. This invitation guarantees the admittance of Squidward Tentacles--" [holds up card and squints eyes] "--Squidward Tentacles..." [misreads phrase on card] "...'Ploos Oh-nay.'"
[Norton appears behinds Squidward.]
Norton: Ah, it's a plus one.
Squidward: Ahh! What are you still doing here?
Norton: It's not "ploos oh-nay." It says "plus one"! [points to words on cards]
Squidward: Plus one! Oh, yeah, of course! Plus one! [starts laughing a little] Sure! [looks at invitation] What's a plus one?
Norton: Well, when you get an invitation to a party, sometimes, they put "plus one" on it to tell you it's okay to bring along a friend.
Squidward: Do you have to do it?
Norton: Well, no, you could go alone. It's just that everyone will laugh at you 'cause they think you're a friendless loser.
Squidward: What? Do you want me to call your supervisor and tell him you're just standing around?
[Norton sadly walks out of Squidward's house. Squidward opens the pop-up picture again.]
Squidward's reflection: You need to find a friend to take as your "plus one".
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Somebody like me?
[Squidward freaks out.]
SpongeBob: I like openings.
Squidward: No, not like you!
[Squidward slams the door on SpongeBob. SpongeBob's face pops back in place again and takes out his jump rope.]
SpongeBob: Come on, jump rope. I guess it's just you and me.
[SpongeBob puts one end of the jump rope inside his ear then walks away.Squidward quickly removes his relaxing stuff and takes out a phone book.]
Squidward: Let's see here. Friends... [coughs and then blows away the dust, then sighs]
Squidward: [while looking through the phone book] Friends, friends...
[Squidward keeps flipping the pages until he spots the number, "555-5717". Squidward gets surprised until it is revealed that the number was formed by little bugs.]
Squidward: Hm. Yeah, I wonder if I still have my receipt for this thing. No big deal. Anybody can make a friend by... [reveals more of the card that says...] ...tonight?! [walks around and thinks a bit] Let's see. There must be someone who's a real part of your life, Squidward. Who do you see every single day? Who do you know like the back of your suction cups?
[Squidward sees SpongeBob out the window, laughing and playing with his jump rope.]
Squidward: But, of course! It's so simple.
[Squidward runs out of the house. SpongeBob falls on his jump rope. Squidward rusn up to SpongeBob.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, I have something to ask you.
[SpongeBob happily blinks his eyes to the camera and grabs Squidward's arm.]
SpongeBob: Of course I'll go to the opening with you!
Squidward: That wasn't the question. Which way did the mailman go?
SpongeBob: Oh, he said he had a package for the Widow Duncan. I think he went...
[Squidward quickly runs off. SpongeBob sadly walks away. Norton is delivering a package at the Widow Duncan's door and is having her sign some papers.]
Norton: And then you just initial there, and we're all set.
Squidward: Hey, there you are!
[Squidward runs up to Norton, but Norton becomes scared as he thinks Squidward is going to hurt him.]
Norton: Not in the face!
Squidward: What? What are you... Oh! [laughs] You always were a big kidder, huh? [laughs a bit] Mailman [thinks a second] guy?
Norton: Actually, I'm not a kidder. I'm much more of an introvert.
Squidward: I love introverts! Why, I'm an introvert!
[Squidward stands on Norton's head and the crowd cheers.]
Norton: You are?
[Squidward jumps down.]
Squidward: Say, I bet we have a lot in common.
Norton: [laughs nervously] Yeah, I don't know. I'm just a regular guy. But in not being a mailman, I love going to fancy art galleries.
Squidward: That's me!
Norton: And eating delicious food.
Squidward: Oh, delicious food is my favorite kind of food! Especially when that delicious food is something you can...
Both: Spread on a toast point!
[They both laugh and hug each other until they calm down.]
Squidward: Once you've had pointed toast, you just never want any other kind.
Norton: Right? And if there's one thing I hate, it's...
Squidward: [simultaneously] SpongeBob!
Norton: [simultaneously] Clarinets!
Squidward: Yeah, I know it... What?
Norton: I mean, what kind of maniac could enjoy the sound of a clarinet? That squeaky, hollow, kind of piercing howl from the very pits of Gehenna. Only a deluded blow-hard with nothing to lose could pick up a [grunts] clarinet and think "Yeah! This is for me! Let me inflict this pain on the world!" [laughs] Am I right, buddy? Heh. Uh.
[Squidward is nowhere to be seen.]
Norton: Buddy? [slaps his face] Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why are you so darn opinionated, Norton? All you do with your searing and abnormal honesty is drive everyone away! When's Norton's time? When's Norton's time to shine?!
Widow Duncan: Oh, Norton! I've always taken a shine to you. [winks as her dentures slide out]
[Norton nervously slides the dentures back in Widow Duncan's mouth and runs away. The scene changes to Squidward walking down a street in Bikini Bottom until he sees a can tied to a string.]
Squidward: Oh, you think you know a guy? [kicks can] Oh, who are you kidding? It's not in the cards for you. I bet not even this old tin can would be my friend.
SpongeBob: [talks through can] I'll be your friend.
Squidward: [grumbles as he picks up the can] Who is this?
SpongeBob: It's me, SpongeBob.
[Squidward looks at the can and reads the label, "Protein Powder" on it. The label on the can gives him an idea.]
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes? I'm still here.
Squidward: I need to ask you something important.
[SpongeBob blinks his eyes in excitement.]
SpongeBob: You don't have to ask me three times.
[SpongeBob rips his pants and reveals a tuxedo underneath.]
Squidward: Will you tell Larry I want to talk to him?
[Squidward runs off and drops the can.]
SpongeBob: Oh.
[SpongeBob picks up the can and sadly starts to play jump rope.]
SpongeBob: Okey-doke.
[The scene changes to several of Larry's friends working out. Squidward is seen standing next to Larry as he is talking to him.]
Larry: So, Squidward, what do you wanna talk about?
Squidward: Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to put into words.
Larry: Oh, I've been there, amigo.
Squidward: You have?
Larry: Sure. But nothing clears the sawdust out of your brains quicker than a ride on a jet ski.
[Larry holds out a jet ski.]
Larry: Ever been on one of these little babies?
Squidward: Um, no. The.. they always seemed a little sporty for me.
Larry: Well, you only live once. And I just happen to have an extra helmet.
[Larry holds out a helmet for Squidward.]
Squidward: What the heck?
[Squidward puts on the helmet and rides with Larry across the water. As they ride, they draw images of Squidward and Larry in the water. Then the fly off a ramp and ride across the beach. The ride through some people standing in line at a ride in the amusement park.]
Unnamed fish: Hey!
[Larry and Squidward ride on the rails of a roller coaster with the jet ski. Squidward is then playing a game of pool with Larry. Then Squidward and Larry are watching a movie and eating popcorn with the jet ski. Squidward and Larry are now at a wig store playing music with the bongos and the clarinet while the jet ski is holding a saxophone. A man passes by and donates money to them.]
Squidward: We make quite a team!
Larry: I'll say!
Squidward: You know, earlier today, I met a jerk who said he didn't like clarinet music.
Larry: Hey, you know, that's very uncool. What kind of thoughtless ding-dong would knock another man's passion?
Squidward: You know, you're alright, Lester.
Larry: It's Larry.
Squidward: Whatever. The point is, do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?
Larry: Well, that's not my kind of thing at all, but... for you, sure. I'll just need to stop by the apartment and make myself a protein shake.
Squidward: What?! You don't need that glop!
Larry: Oh, I wouldn't call it "glop". Protein shake saved my life, bro.
Squidward: Oh, come on. It's a fad. You don't wanna be one of those mindless rubes who marches around in a constant haze of stupidity. "I love protein shakes. I'm the most gullible rube on the planet. Duh! Duh! Duh! Give me my stupid protein shake."
[Squidward bumps into Larry while he continues to mock. He looks up and sees Larry in extreme anger after the way he made fun of him.]
Squidward: [dumbfounded] I mean...
[Larry punches Squidward to the ground and walks off. Squidward pops his head out.]
Squidward: So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?
[Squidward looks at his reflection on the window.]
Squidward: [sighs] I guess it's just you and me again.
[Squidward turns and sees SpongeBob breathing heavily.]
Squidward: [scoffs] What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: [holds out his jump rope] Just playing draggy rope. You wanna play?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: You hold on to one end of the rope and you drag it behind you like a sea snake is chasing you, like this. Wanna play?
Squidward: Just get me out of here!
SpongeBob: [silence] Will do.
[SpongeBob pulls Squidward out of the hole with the jump rope, but ends up making him fall flat on his face.]
Squidward: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Anything for a friend.
[Squidward comes up with an idea.]
Squidward: Friend?
[Squidward sees his reflection in SpongeBob's eyes and grins.]
Squidward: Would you be my plus one?
[SpongeBob gasps in excitement. The scene changes to people attending the Galleria Diptheria. A limousine drives up and Squidward, who is now wearing a tuxedo, steps out.]
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob, dressed in a black suit, comes out of the limousine with a mirror that shows Squidward's reflection and closes the door. Squidward and SpongeBob walk across the red rug with the mirror.]
Perch Perkins: And here comes Squidward Tentacles and what must be either a bizarre piece of performance art or the saddest display of loneliness it has ever been my displeasure to report. One is inclined to suspect the second thing I said. A thing about sadness!
[Squidward and SpongeBob stop in the middle.]
Squidward's reflection: You'll always be my plus one!
Squidward: Aww!
[The episode ends with people taking random pictures of Squidward, SpongeBob and the mirror with Squidward's reflection on it.]


[The episode begins with Patrick running to the Krusty Krab. He trips and falls on his face. He gets up and walks inside the restaurant until he is grabbed by Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, hold on a second there, free-loader! What are you doing here?
Patrick: I'm here for lunch.
Mr. Krabs: Did you bring money this time?
Patrick: [Patrick holds out a couple of dollar bills.] Yes! [Mr. Krabs eyes start to bark like dogs.]
Mr. Krabs: Let me see that. [Mr. Krabs takes the money and sniffs them. Then he rubs them on his tongue and teeth a few times. Then he licks them, then he eats them, swallows them and spits them out.] Alright, tastes real. Now get in line!
Patrick: [Patrick takes the money.] Yes, sir! [He walks up to the line where business people are waiting. Some of them are executives.]
Bill: Hey, how's that new executive treatment sandwich treating you? Cause it's hitting all the quadrants of my hunger markets.
Patrick: [Listening to the conversation] Mmm, quadrants!
Bill: You know, it reminds me of something I was thinking about business the other day.
Harold: The satisfaction earnings of the fourth quarter of my lunch are off the charts! [The two executives laugh]
Bill: And I love the way it tastes! [They continue laughing]
Yellow Executive: And business, my friend, is the business I'm talking about.
Marv: Well, one can't have business without business right?
Yellow Executive: Interesting point, Marv. How's your sandwich?
Marv: Absolutely spectacular! This new menu item is the business plan I can really get behind!
Executive: I tell you, this is one dynamic little sandwich.
Shubie: With levels of proactiveness that are off the charts. Business wise.
Executive: It really appeals to my demographic.
Shubie: Well, you are an executive in a fast-paced world of business.
Executive: Ha, ha! That's for sure!
Patrick: [Patrick walks to the register.] These guys talk funny words.
Squidward: Oh, yeah. They're a riot. What can I get ya?
Patrick: I guess I'll have one of these business sandwiches everybody's talking about.
Squidward: Ah, the executive treatment.
Patrick: Is that what you call it?
Squidward: Well, that's what Mr. Krabs makes me call it. It's really just a Krabby Patty that costs more. And SpongeBob wears a different tie when he makes it.
Patrick: Oh, wow! I'll take seven!
Squidward: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. The executive treatment is available to executives only. I'm not sorry.
Patrick: But I never wanted anything so much in my whole life! Since this morning when I wanted a donut-night at the "Donut" and it was great! The donut is gone! [Patrick shakes Squidward.] The donut is gone!
Squidward: [Squidward pushes Patrick's hands away.] First of all, a lot of that donut, it's still on your face! [Patrick has half a donut on his face and licks it off.]
Patrick: Now, where's my executive treatment?
Squidward: I told you, it's for executives only! And you aren't even dressed like an executive! I could of course sell you [Squidward pulls out a tie] the official Krusty Krab business tie for only 10 dollars.
Patrick: Will the tie let me order the executive treatment?
Squidward: Not on its own, no. But you could Krabby-size the tie with and get a pair of [Squidward pulls out some glasses] business glasses for additional 10 dollars.
Patrick: [Laughs] Well, I'd be stupid not to!
Squidward: Well, you're half right.
Patrick: Here's your 20 bucks. [Patrick gives Squidward 20 dollars.]
Squidward: Here's your glasses. [Patrick puts on the tie and glasses.]
Patrick: Thanks! I'll take one executive treatment, my good man. [SpongeBob pops out of the window with the executive treatment sandwich.]
SpongeBob: Here's your executive treatment!
Squidward: [Squidward takes the sandwich off SpongeBob and gives Patrick the sandwich.] Here you go.
Patrick: Oh, man! [whispers] It looks executively delicious! [As he goes to eat the sandwich, Marv runs up and grabs Patrick.]
Marv: Carl, what are you doing standing around at a time like this? We're gonna be late for the big brainstorming meeting! [Executives appear behind Patrick and start to push him out of the restaurant.]
Patrick: But! But! [Patrick gets shoved out of the door.] Save my sandwich for me, Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: [snickers] I'll save it alright. I'll just put it here in the circular files. [Opens a trashcan and attempts to throw the sandwich away]
Mr. Krabs: [Pops out of the trashcan] What are you doing throwing away a perfectly sellable sandwich?!
[The executives continue to push Patrick through the streets of Bikini Bottom until they reach a building called the business industries.]
Patrick: No! [The executives push Patrick through the doors which makes him lose his hands. The executives punch in their tickets in the punch in/out clock. Patrick puts his hand in the clock and his hand turns into a ticket. The executives push Patrick into the elevator.] No! [The elevator closes and everything is quiet. Patrick is settled as the music is played. The elevator takes them to the 115th floor of the building. The executives push Patrick out of the elevator.] No! [They stop at a door to the conference room with the address code 4-B on it.] Not 4-B! No!
Marv: Wow! You're very upset about conference room 4-B. And I can't say I blame you. Because conference room 4-B is the most terrifying conference room in the whole building. More people have been fired in here than all the other conference rooms combined! [Patrick screams] Save it for the big brainstorming meeting! [Marv opens the doors] Right here is where all the biggest business decisions in the business are made. Why if an impostor were to be caught in here, hmm...
Patrick: He'd be given a sandwich and sent on his way?
Marv: No, he'd be convicted as a corporate spy and sent to jail forever and ever and ever. Hey, where are you going?
Patrick: I think I’ve forgot to water my manatee I'll just--? [Patrick goes to open the doors and leave, but was quickly opened and slammed into by a tall green eel with a business outfit on.]
Stockholder Eel: Gentlemen, please. [The doors close and Patrick slides off the wall.]
Patrick: [dazed] Where am I?
Stockholder Eel: Exactly. I like you, young man. Everybody scoot down and so he can sit next to me. And I won't intimidate him at all by my terrifyingly largeness and proximity. As this junior executive so eloquently put it, “Where exactly are we?”
Marv: Ah, sir, if you take a look at this [Marv shows a line chart on the easel.] I believe you'll agree that we’re perfectly positioned for our marketing to be number one across the business sector. [The executives murmur in agreement.]
Stockholder Eel: I need a straight answer, not a bunch of meaningless charts! What do you give a disappointed stockholder to make him feel better? [The stockholder eel looks at Patrick.]
Patrick: A sandwich? [The stockholder eel looks at the executives. The executives laugh.]
Harold: Get a load of this guy! A sandwich!
Marv: This guy has sandwiches on the brain!
Patrick: [Patrick’s head is shaped like a sandwich] No I don't! [The executives continue to laugh]
Tom: That's just about the silliest piece of idea!
Stockholder Eel: Alright, hold it! Now all of you just hold it right there! It's easy to laugh and judge and heap a man with scholar when you hear an idea that stands out because it's so unusual. [The executives mope.] So, everybody, just stop and think for a minute about what your colleague is really trying to say because I want to be the one to tell him, "That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard."
Patrick: What if I had a meaningless chart?
Stockholder Eel: Yes, maybe I was too hasty about that. [Patrick draws a picture of himself holding a sandwich on the easel.] Well, you're definitely giving a new meaning to the word “meaningless”.
Patrick: Oh, wait! [Patrick draws a sun with a happy face on the easel. Then he draws a house.] And here's a little house with smoke coming out of the chimney. See what I mean? [The stockholder eel growls and becomes angry.] I guess he likes my chart, 'cause he's smiling.
Marv: He smiles like that when he's really angry. [The executives murmur in concern.]
Patrick: Do you slap your palms down on the table like that too?
Stockholder Eel: [growls] Yes.
Patrick: Oh.
Stockholder Eel: I don't know who you are, but you better not be an impostor. Do you know what happens to impostors in conference room 4-B?
Patrick: Well, uh, let's see. Uh, don't tell me! I-I know it's not sandwiches. They don't get sandwiches. Do they?
Stockholder Eel: [The stockholder eel slaps his head in disgust. He holds out a drinking straw.] Mister, this is the last straw! [The executives hold out their cups and sigh at the fact that they’ve run out of straws.] Now, I'm just going to give you just 18 more chances to prove yourself.
Narrator: Montage. [Patrick is seen writing on the board while trying to solve an equation. He draws a picture of a sandwich as an answer. The stockholder eel gets really angry and rips his mustache off his face in frustration. The executives gasps.]
Stockholder Eel: Jenkins!
Jenkins: Yes, sir?
Stockholder Eel: Mustache. [Jenkins rips his mustache off his face.]
Jenkins: Here you are sir. [Jenkins sheds a tear as he hands his mustache to the stockholder eel. The stockholder eel takes the mustache and puts it on his face.]
[The scene changes to Patrick and Marv stamping "No" signs on different papers. Patrick stamps on Marv’s head and Marv stamps him back. Soon, they ended up stamping each other, much to the stockholder eel’s disgust. Marv stamps “Void” on Patrick’s forehead. Officer John and Officer Rob come in and randomly hit Marv, forcing him to leave the building. The scene changes to Patrick baking a pie in the oven. He puts the pie on a copy machine causing it to splat, he makes a copy with a purple pie chart on it. He shows it to the stockholder eel, but he splatters it on Patrick’s face. The paper slides off and Patrick licks the pie goop off his face while the stockholder eel walks away. The next scene shows Harold filling up a mug with water from the drinking fountain. He puts the mug on the table and gives Patrick a thumbs up and he’s ready to dive. Patrick jumps off the diving board and lands in the mug. The stockholder eel takes the mug off of Patrick’s head and walks away drinking out of it. Patrick sits there with his head shaped like a mug. The scene changes to Patrick and the stockholder eel in conference room 4-B at the top floor of the building.]
Patrick: [holding a book containing his official report] And so in conclusion, I would like to submit my official report. [Patrick gives the stockholder eel his official report. As the stockholder eel goes to read it, it turns out that Patrick made paper-dolls out of his report.]
Stockholder Eel: You know, kid. We need somebody like you around here.
Patrick: You do? [The stockholder eel, finally fed up with Patrick’s stupidity, whacks his official report off the table.]
Stockholder Eel: For me to fire!
Patrick: Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve got a surprise for you. [Patrick takes off his glasses and tie. The executives gasp.] You can't fire me! I'm not an executive at all! I'm just a guy who happens to like sandwiches! So, go ahead! Send me away forever as a corporate spy if you want to! But not before I've had my say! [Just as Patrick is about to finish, Officers John and Rob show up and whack him a couple times. The scene changes to Bikini Bottom Jail where Patrick is ironing his heavy chain ball with the other prisoners. Officer Rob comes in.]
Officer Rob: You have a visitor. [Officer Rob takes Patrick to the meeting room where SpongeBob is waiting.]
Patrick: Who is it?
SpongeBob: Hello, Patrick.
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hey, I heard you're in charge of the laundry room on Thursdays. That's nice.
Patrick: Yeah. Well, it's pretty nice I guess.
SpongeBob: You know what that makes you?
Patrick: Nuh-uh.
SpongeBob: [holds out a Krabby Patty] An executive!
Patrick: Oh, wait! Oh, is that what I think it is?!
SpongeBob: Uh-huh! An executive treatment! [SpongeBob shoves the sandwich through the telephone and Patrick eats it. Patrick and SpongeBob stare at each other for a few moments. Patrick tears off his jail clothes and puts his glasses and tie back on.]
Officer Rob: [gasps] What happened to prisoner 665321? [Rob pushes the alarm button. Patrick leaves the meeting room as officers run all over the place.]
Patrick: Let's go home, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Okay, but who are you? [Patrick and SpongeBob laugh as they both leave Bikini Bottom Jail during the lockdown. They stop at the gate.] No seriously. Who are you?


[The episode starts off with SpongeBob working at the Krusty Krab. Food items shaped into a picnic are put on the grill. SpongeBob starts speaking in their voices.]
Herb (SpongeBob): Sure is a nice day for a picnic.
Loretta (SpongeBob): Oh Herb! It's like a second honeymoon!
Herb (SpongeBob): Just look at Timmy and Sally throwing the old disc around!
Timmy (SpongeBob): C'mon and throw it, sis!
Sally (SpongeBob): I just wanna say I'm gonna be real sad when you go off to college.
[Sally plops onto the grill.]
Timmy (SpongeBob): Oh Sally, don't be such a goop! (SpongeBob appears, tears in his eyes) You know... I'll always be your big brother! [sniffles]
[SpongeBob starts crying and his tears start  dropping on the grill.]
Loretta (SpongeBob): Is it starting to rain?
Herb (SpongeBob): Nothing can spoil this perfect day!
Sally (SpongeBob): What's the matter big brother got something in your eye?
Timmy (SpongeBob): Yeah... that's it... that must be it...
Sally (SpongeBob): Ha haw, now who's the goof? Just watch out because here it comes!
[SpongeBob makes Sally throw the disc/pickle.]
Squidward: Oh, what now? Too much weeing. What is...
[The pickle lands in Squidward's face, causing Squidward not to see.]
Squidward: [screams] PICKLE JUICE! Oh, my eye!
[Squidward tries to grab something to make him see again, but instead picks up the hot sauce and squirts it in his eye. This causes his eye to catch fire.]
Squidward: [screams]
Mr. Krabs: I smell something burning.
Squidward: Yeah. Probably my eye.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, stop your drama, Squidward.
[Mr. Krabs blows the extinguisher in his face.]
Squidward: You missed a spot.
[Mr. Krabs flashes it in his face three times. He walks into the kitchen and sees what SpongeBob is doing. He then blows the extinguisher on Herb, Loretta, Timmy, and Sally.]
Mr. Krabs: What in the name of Neptune's tail fin is going on in here, boy?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally.
Mr. Krabs: Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive.
SpongeBob: Like what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!
SpongeBob: At this point it would be ketchuping up the water.
Mr. Krabs: Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?
SpongeBob: Well, I could try. [scoops off the burnt patties and puts a new one on] Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete.
Mr. Krabs: Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!
[Pete droops a bit.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!
SpongeBob: Maybe Pete is just tired.
Mr. Krabs: Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs. [sprays ketchup on the productivity chart] I guess it might affect his productivity-
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No! Not his productivity!
SpongeBob: Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!
SpongeBob: Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!
Mr. Krabs: Company picnic?
[Pete comes back up.]
SpongeBob: See, look! He's already perking up!
Mr. Krabs: Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?
SpongeBob: Definitely!
Squidward: [opens door] What's going on in here?
Mr. Krabs:  Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob high-five each other and then the screen moves to the window and shows an eye that then goes back to The Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea.
[The scene changes to Jellyfish Fields and shows SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward sitting on toilet paper.]
Squidward: This is the greatest company picnic ever?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes it is.
SpongeBob: Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started.
Squidward: Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses.
[SpongeBob puts on a hat made out of toilet paper.]
SpongeBob: Here's one!
Squidward: Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here.
Mr. Krabs: Right you are! Here's the food! [points to a pile of condiment packs.]
Squidward: [picks up packet of mustard] What?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack. [bites a pack of mustard and opens it with his mouth.] See? You open it with your teeth. [puts mustard on a round piece of toilet paper.] There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around.
[Squidward holds the disk-shaped paper.]
Mr. Krabs: Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Going long!
Mr. Krabs: Ho, ho. This is so much fun.
[SpongeBob runs out far.]
SpongeBob: Is this far enough?
Mr. Krabs: I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!
[Mr. Krabs throws disk-shaped paper but ends up flying in Squidward's face, covering him with mustard.]
Mr. Krabs: [looks out] Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere.
[The disk-shaped paper with mustard slides off of Squidward's face.]
Squidward: I'm going home.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Squidward] Oh no you're not. [sets him down] You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!
Squidward: [grumbles]
[SpongeBob comes back and sees Squidward's face smeared with mustard.]
SpongeBob: Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs. [licks some mustard from Squidward's face] Ahh. Here, let me try!
[SpongeBob grabs a pack of ketchup and opens it with his teeth. He turns around and does his make-over with the ketchup. He turns around again with the face of Barnacle Boy.]
SpongeBob: Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, "This was the greatest..."
Squidward: Do not say it!
Mr. Krabs: "The greatest comp..."
Squidward: Don't!
Mr. Krabs: [a rainbow appears] "The greatest company picnic ever!"
[Suddenly, they hear loud music and a van is driving up towards them.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, looks like we've got company.
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic. [laughs]
Squidward: Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs nervously] I have? Wait. Oh yeah.
[The van drives past them and backs up.]
Mr. Krabs: [reads the license plate on the van] "Chumpany Picnic"? That's not how you spell "Company Picnic"!
Plankton: [honks the horn] Guess who?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton!
[Plankton hops out of the van.]
Mr. Krabs: Just what do ya think you're doin', Plankton?
Plankton: Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot.
Mr. Krabs: Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!
Plankton: Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day.
SpongeBob: [happy] Aww!
Mr. Krabs: You don't even have any employees!
SpongeBob: [sad] Aww!
Plankton: Sure I do.
[Two robots that resemble SpongeBob and Squidward pop out of the van.]
Plankton: Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around.
[Simmy throws the disk at Tally, but bounces back. They do it two times.]
SpongeBob: A real disk?
Mr. Krabs: Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!
SpongeBob: Well. Eh.
Plankton: You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all.
SpongeBob: Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic.
[Squidward is wrapped up in toilet paper and is being chased by jellyfish. Simmy and Tally placed a huge trunk in the middle of the ground.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?
Plankton: Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities.
[As Plankton talks, Simmy and Tally set up numerous things people see at a carnival.]
Plankton: The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies...
Squidward: Delicacies?
Plankton: And of course, the dunking booth!
[Tally throws the ball and Simmy gets dunked in the dunking booth. Simmy short-circuits and explodes. Plankton becomes worried.]
Plankton: [turns SpongeBob around] Have you seen the calliope?
[Tally plays the calliope.]
SpongeBob: Aww!
Mr. Krabs: Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display...
Squidward: One side, Goopy!
[Squidward runs past Mr. Krabs, which makes him spin around until his shell falls off. Seeing that he is naked, Mr. Krabs is embarrassed. Squidward gobbles up the cotton candy and roasted peanuts in a crazy frenzy.]
SpongeBob: Yum.
[Mr. Krabs struggles to get his shell back on.]
Mr. Krabs: Is this backwards? [grunts] Oh, that's not it either.
Plankton: You were saying, Krabs? [laughs]
SpongeBob: [angry] Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs manages to get his shell back on.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?
[SpongeBob zips Mr. Krabs' shell and they both leave. They sit back down to their picnic area. Then they see Squidward having fun on the world's most exciting roller coaster.]
SpongeBob: Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Squidward: [offscreen] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [holds up some condiments] You want me to paint your face?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know.
[SpongeBob sprays mayonnaise on Mr. Krabs' face.]
SpongeBob: Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost.
[SpongeBob makes a beard out of the mayonnaise on Mr. Krabs' face. However, the mayonnaise smelled terrible.]
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad.
SpongeBob: [eerily] Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. [laughs nervously]
[Tally holds a huge amount of cotton candy over Simmy.]
Simmy: Whoa! Stop! That is almost too much cotton candy!
[Tally drops the cotton candy on Simmy. Simmy short-circuits and explodes. Mr. Krabs wipes the mayonnaise off his face.]
Mr. Krabs: You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?
SpongeBob: No. Course not.
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure you don't want to?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!
Mr. Krabs: You sure?
SpongeBob: 100% sure, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!
[Mr. Krabs runs back to Plankton's company picnic and plays the games of chance wheel. As the wheel spins, his eyes spin. The wheel stops and Mr. Krabs wins a stuffed walrus from Tally. Then he played the game of knocking the bottles with the ball and wins a second stuffed walrus from Tally.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] You can never have too many!
Squidward: Whoo!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squiddie-bird!
[Squidward jumps off the roller coaster and runs with Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: Whoo! [picks up the mustard plate but drops it] Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs are having the time of their lives at Plankton's company picnic.]
SpongeBob: It's a paper plate. Whoo! [throws plate and drops it]
[SpongeBob hears Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton laughing together as they are having a fun time. SpongeBob thinks for a bit and realizes that the Krusty Krab company picnic isn't as fun as it seemed.]
SpongeBob: Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me.
[SpongeBob decides to go and join the fun. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are laughing together.]
Squidward: I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees...
Plankton: Say no more, my friend. [holds out contract] If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh! [grabs the pen and contract] Me first! Me first!
Plankton: Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day.
Mr. Krabs: That's such great advice!
[Squidward sucks on the pen.]
Plankton: This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more! [laughs evilly]
[An angry SpongeBob appears next to Plankton, meaning that he heard everything Plankton said.]
SpongeBob: Ahem! Hello, Plankton!
Plankton: Uh oh.
[SpongeBob sees Mr. Krabs, who is about to sign Plankton's contract.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!
[SpongeBob pounces on Mr. Krabs and prevents him from signing the contract. However, his actions sends the pen flying.]
Mr. Krabs: My candied pen!
[The pen is hurling towards Simmy. SpongeBob, in slow motion, runs to Simmy.]
SpongeBob: [in slow motion] Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!
[The pen is about to hit Simmy.]
SpongeBob: [in slow motion] No!
[However, instead of hitting Simmy, it went through the robot. The pen lands on the ground and rolls to a projector. SpongeBob bangs on the projector, revealing that Simmy and Tally was just a trash can and a ball wash post.]
SpongeBob: Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means...
[The projector reveals that the world's most exciting roller coaster was actually a rotting corpse of a sea monster.]
Squidward: I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?
[The projector reveals that the food Squidward ate was just rotten chum. The projector also revealed that the pen he was sucking on was a caterpillar. Squidward freaks out and rubs his tongue in disgust. The projector reveals that the van Plankton drove on was an old broken down van. Mr. Krabs gasps in wonder what the stuffed walruses were. But nothing happens.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew! That was a cl...
[The projector reveals that the stuffed walruses were actually fish skeletons. Mr. Krabs screams in terror and the skeletons crumble to dust.]
Mr. Krabs: You saved me, boy. How did you do it?
SpongeBob: I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs.
[Plankton walks up to them.]
Plankton: Unbelievable!
[Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton.]
Plankton: Uh oh.
[Mr. Krabs puts Plankton on the disk-shaped paper with mustard and throws him out in the distance. Once it landed, there was an explosion.]
SpongeBob: [jumps up as a rainbow appears and jellyfish fly around] The greatest company picnic ever!
Mr. Krabs: Alright, enough relaxin'. Back to work! [laughs as he leaves]
[The episode ends with SpongeBob still being in the air and an angry Squidward gets stung in the head by a jellyfish.]


[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs pops out of the front door and sniffs around.]
Mr. Krabs: Nope. Nothing. [walks back in] I can't smell a cent or a dollar. Or any money in a 5-mile radius. We might as well settle down early. [Squidward squeals in joy. Mr. Krabs points to Dennis at his table] Just as soon as that guy finishes his meal.
Squidward: You mean the guy who's been nursing a single fry for the last hour?
Mr. Krabs: When he goes, you can go. [Mr. Krabs walks off as Squidward bashes his head on the register in disgust.]
Squidward: Grr! [Squidward walks up to Dennis who is sucking on his French fry] Excuse me, sir. But you seem to be having trouble masticating. Here let me help you. [Squidward shoves the French fry in Dennis' mouth and makes him chew it until he swallows it. Dennis gets up and leaves.] What? No tip? Finally! Yes! [walks out the door] Leaving early! I can't believe this is finally happening! [Suddenly, the sky turns black and rain starts to pour. The wind blows the flags off the Krusty Krab. A bolt of lightning strikes the Krusty Krab sign and the shell breaks off. The wind blows a bulldozer and breaks the sign pole off the ground. Then lightning strikes Squidward, leaving him barbecued. Squidward runs back into the restaurant.] Cause it's not.
Mr. Krabs: Oh my! That's quite a storm! You know, a storm like this puts me in the mind of me old navy days.
SpongeBob: Old navy days?! Ohh!
Mr. Krabs: That gives me a fine idea, SpongeBob. Since it looks we're gonna be stuck here for a while, why don't you pull up a barrel, me laddies? While I retell you a thrillin' tale of me mysterious salty past. [Squidward, who is barbecued from the storm, turns to dust. Then it cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward sitting at a table as Mr. Krabs brings a bowl.] There, now. The lights are properly dimmed. [pulls out an open, cracker box] Feast yourself on these slightly expired soda crackies [dumps the cube of stale crackers from the box and on the table. The cube shatters the bowl] as I explain ya the yarn that puts hair on your chest.
Squidward: I don't want any hair on my chest.
SpongeBob: Ooh, I do! [SpongeBob takes the cube of stale crackers, shoves it in his mouth and eats it.]
Mr. Krabs: It was a day just like this one. The wind was howling! [As Mr. Krabs begins his story, the scene changes to a ship sailing through a storm at sea.] And me ship was being tossed about,  like a rag doll on a trampoline! [The scene changes to the moment where Mr. Krabs, who had hair at that time, was a chef.] I was in the galley! Cooking up grub for me crew to keep their mind off this horrible squall! [Mr. Krabs chops some vegetables and made a salad. Then he peels a potato and adds it to the soup on the stove. He then takes a petal from a flower and adds it to the soup. Then he added some spices which formed in the shape of a heart and flies in the soup.] It was just then that he bursts into the galley!
SpongeBob: Who he?
Mr. Krabs: The man whose mission was to make my life a living nightmare! [As Mr. Krabs explains, SpongeBob takes the cracker box and eats some more stale crackers. He then eats the box next.] The roughest, toughest, scaliest old barnacle that ever roamed the briny deep! He was me commandin' officer and he loathe me with the white, hot hatred of a psychotic madman! [changes back to the ship] They called him, [A starfish that resembles Patrick Star bursts through the galley door in a captain outfit with a scar on the right side of his face] Captain Scarfish!
Captain Scarfish: Hello!
SpongeBob: Ahh! [cuts back to Mr. Krabs putting frosting on the cake. Scarfish's entrance scares him and accidentally melts the cake with the frosting.]
Captain Scarfish: Stand at attention, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs walks up and salutes the captain in fear.] I want you to tell me the meaning of this! [Scarfish shows him a sandwich on a plate.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that sir? Why sir, that's a sea-cucumber sandwich, sir, with the crusts cut off, sir. A little booshie-amusie for the boys, sir. [Scarfish throws the sandwich away.]
Captain Scarfish: This is the navy, son! We don't cut the crusts off! We eat the crusts and throw the rest away! [Scarfish opens a trunk full of dangerous, moldy crusts and starts craving on it.]
Mr. Krabs: But that's... That's madness! [Mr. Krabs tabs on the captain's shoulder. The captain turns around as he is chewing on the moldy crusts. He swallows the crusts.]
Captain Scarfish: I'm telling you for the last time! You're gonna have to stop making your food so delicious!
Mr. Krabs: But I don't know how!
Captain Scarfish: Well, you better figure it out! I need my men [stretches his face] wide-eyed and hungry, Krabs! We've got a cargo-hold full of suntan lotion! And... [Squidward interrupts]
Squidward: Wait, you were transporting suntan lotion? [laughs] What SPF? [continues laughing]
Mr. Krabs: I don't see what's so amusing about that, Mr. Squidward. We were a cargo ship [cuts back to the ship sailing in pirate territory where a sailor is swabbing the deck] heading straight into pirate territory with a fresh supply of suntan lotion for shipwreck sailors whose skin was chafed. [Squidward yawns] Chafed, Mr. Squidward!
SpongeBob: Chafed! [cuts back to ship]
Captain Scarfish: Chafed!
Mr. Krabs: Aye, sir! I understand, sir! Chafed!
Captain Scarfish: So, tonight's meal is gonna be terrible! You understand, me?!
Mr. Krabs: Aye, sir!
Captain Scarfish: The worst you've ever made!
Mr. Krabs: Aye-aye, sir!
Captain Scarfish: [turns around and pulls his shirt up. As he talks, his back forms a shape of a steel bar on his back] The kind of slop that will put some steel in their spines!
Mr. Krabs: Aye-aye, sir!
Captain Scarfish: Either that or I'll throw you in the brig! [Scarfish walks away]
Mr. Krabs: Yes, sir. [cuts to the captain's crew sitting at the table waiting for their food. Mr. Krabs walks in the dining room with the slop.]
Crew: Huzzah!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't "huzzah" yet, boys.
Lou: What's on the menu tonight, eh?
Mr. Krabs: Slop. [The crew laughs]
Lou: Oh, slop, eh? Good one! Why don't you put some of that delicious slop right here on my... [Mr. Krabs dishes up some slop on Lou's plate] Oh. I bet it's one of those things that looks bad, but it tastes really... [Lou tastes the slop but swallows it in disgust.] Bad.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sorry boys. [Mr. Krabs dishes the slop to the other sailors. He groans while serving the food.] Captain's orders. [Unfortunately, the crew doesn't like the slop and looks at Mr. Krabs in anger. Mr. Krabs becomes fed up with the captain's cruel orders.] Oh, I can't stand it! [Turns around and suits up like a soldier going for battle.] I don't care what the captain says! [He hits the service cart and turns the slop into pizza dough. He flips the dough a couple times and chops it up with a spatula, which then turns into a more, delectable meal for the crew.]
Crew: [gasps] Huzzah! Huzzah for Mr. Krabs! Huzzah! [Suddenly, Captain Scarfish bursts in, ruining the moment.]
Captain Scarfish: What's all this "huzzahing" about?!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nothing sir! Uh, they just really enjoy eating slop! Don't you, boys? [The crew mushes the delectable meal into slop to hide it from the captain.]
Captain Scarfish: Attention! [The crew salutes in fear. Captain Scarfish examines the food.] Looks like slop alright. But what's this? [Shows a bowl full of ice cream with raspberry syrup and a cherry.]
Mr. Krabs: Cherries jubilee.
Crew: Cherries jubilee!
Captain Scarfish: Cherries jubilee?!
Mr. Krabs: Well, flaming cherries jubilee.
Captain Scarfish: Flaming?! What are you trying to pull, you lubber? This looks like regular cherries jubilee!
Mr. Krabs: Well, you see, sir, I was just gonna take this here match and... [Lights a match and blows the flame on the cherries jubilee. This sets it on fire and the captain is burned in the face. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs locked in a prison cell.] And so, I found meself in the brig with two guards watching me every move. [A strange shadow appears on the wall next to the cell.] The one was as brutal and ugly a bounder as you ever wish to see in your darkest nightmare! [The shadow gets smaller and reveals to be a guard that looks like Squidward who is playing his clarinet.]
Octopus Sailor: Grr, what are you looking at? [The Octopus Sailor skips away as he continues playing his clarinet. As he skips away, a guard that looks like SpongeBob named Ensign is sitting, playing with a toy boat.]
Mr. Krabs: But I thought I could dupe the other one sure than need a rise. [The SpongeBob guard puts the boat toy in his head and forms a race track with his tongue. The boat slides out and the Ensign giggles. The scene changes back to SpongeBob laughing.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs. That second guard sounds like a real goofball.
Mr. Krabs: I managed to worm some useful information out of him right away. You see, he was an aspiring cook and I talked him into seeking some things down into the brig for me. The tombs of me trade you might say. [The scene changes to the SpongeBob guard making something out of cotton candy.] I set him to work on a sponge-sugared cathedral that took up most of his attention. [Mr. Krabs takes some cotton candy and makes a key out of it.] He never suspected that I was using the scraps to fashion a candy-key. Where's your sourpuss friend tonight?
Ensign: Sick in bed like all the men. The captain's been feeding them nothing but moldy, old sandwich crusts. [Ensign makes cotton candy from the machine.] They've all got terrible bellyaches. But not me, though. I cook for myself.
Mr. Krabs: Wise lad. [Mr. Krabs finishes making the candy-key as Ensign eats some cotton candy. This gives him a major league sugar rush.] And so, after a few hours of bouncing off the walls, the sugar finally wore off. [Ensign stops bouncing around and quickly falls asleep.] And soon, he was napping like a baby. This was me chance to use me sweet key to freedom. [Mr. Krabs goes to unlock himself out of his cell, but thinks for a minute and looks at Captain Scarfish's picture.] But did I dare take it? I'd be in violation of the naval code. Then something happened that made me mind up for me. [A cannonball appears out of nowhere and hits the wall.] Pirates! We were under attack! [Mr. Krabs frees himself from his cell.] I had to act fast! [He picks up Ensign and shakes him.] Wake up, lad! Wake up! Man your battle stations! [Ensign falls back to sleep. Mr. Krabs runs to the sickbay to get help, but the Octopus Sailor and the entire crew were to sick and weak to do anything.] I was on me own. [Mr. Krabs takes a telescope and sees a pirate ship and an island with the shipwreck sailors on it.] I could see it all. A pirate ship! And on that island: a crew of five naval men! Our only hope, marooned on a beach by those same scurvy pirates! [He imagines them being flipped and sizzled in a frying pan.] And suffered from the effects of chafe! Sunburn! [Then a boat with pirates are shown rowing towards the cargo ship. On the boat, their captain looks a lot like Sandy Cheeks.] The pirates had already launched a boat and were preparing to board our vessel!
Pirate Captain: Row, you worthless dogs!
Captain Scarfish: [Captain Scarfish bursts through the door.] Stand down, Krabs! I'll have you on irons! [He holds up two irons with steam coming out from the bottoms.]
Mr. Krabs: Listen to me, Captain! This is gonna get real ugly real fast! We've got to get to the cannons!
Captain Scarfish: We're not outfitted for battle, Krabs! There's no ammunition! The cannons are ornamental at best! [He shows a fancy-looking gold cannon with a candlestick holder on it.] Ornamental at best!
Mr. Krabs: Then listen carefully! We'll have to go down to the cargo-hold and poke holes in the barrels of suntan lotion and scuttle the ship!
Captain Scarfish: What you're suggesting is mutiny! [Suddenly, someone flings something on the captain's hat, making one of his hat decorations fall off. It turns out to be Ensign.]
Ensign: Do as he says, captain!
Mr. Krabs: What are you using for ammo there, Ensign?
Ensign: Oh, I rolled up an old, moldy sandwich crust into a hard, little ball. [Ensign takes a moldy crust and forms a ball.]
Mr. Krabs: [This give Mr. Krabs an idea.] That's it! [Mr. Krabs pushes Scarfish.] Come with me, lad! [Ensign and Mr. Krabs takes some moldy, old sandwich crusts and makes them into cannonballs. Mr. Krabs stuffs the moldy crust cannonball in the ornamental cannon. Ensign fires the cannonball at the ship which easily destroys it.] Direct hit!
Mr. Krabs and Ensign: Huzzah! [But the pirate captain and her crew invades the ship.]
Pirate Captain: You'll pay for that! Get 'em boys! [The pirates begin to attack.]
Ensign: Uh, what do I do?
Mr. Krabs: Get down to the cargo-hold and check on the captain! [Mr. Krabs uses his telescope as a sword as SpongeBob goes for the captain.] Charge! Hup! Hey! Whoop! Whoa! Hi-yah! Woo! [He whacks the pirate on the head.] Close one! Ha-ha! [He continues to fight as the pirate captain sits and watches with a cup of root beer in her hand.]
Pirate Captain: Aww, he's kinda handsome for a crusty old cuss.
Captain Scarfish: [Scarfish weeps as Ensign finds him in the cargo-hold.] I can't do it. I'm weak.
Ensign: Snap out of it, man! [Ensign slaps Scarfish, but to his surprise, the scar was a fake. Scarfish gasps and Ensign finds his scar on his hand.] Eeww!
Captain Scarfish: My personality! [Scarfish continues crying.]
Ensign: Oh, uh, let me put that back. [He slaps Scarfish again and his scar is back on his face, much to Scarfish's happiness. Ensign takes a sword and climbs to the top of the barrel and pokes a big hole on it. Releasing a huge torrent of suntan lotion which sweeps away Scarfish. Ensign swings to the ship's haul and makes an opening for the torrent. The suntan lotion with Scarfish on it surfs towards the island with the five naval fish on it. The lotion successfully cured them from their sunburns.]
Naval Fish: Oh my! This feels wonderful! Yes, it feels great! [The naval fish gets up and swims to the cargo ship to rescue Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs continues fighting the pirates.] Hoo! Whoo! Ha-ha! Whoop! Missed me! [He fights until he loses his telescope.] Uh-oh! Uh, anyone for cherries jubilee?
Pirate Captain: Finish him off! [Just as Mr. Krabs was about to meet his end, the naval fish appears.]
Naval Fish: Huzzah for Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ha-ha! The sunburn brigade! [The naval fish traps the pirates in a net.] Ha-ha! Me plan worked! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!
Pirate Captain: Handsome and clever, I see. [She blinks at him for a few seconds, but instead of releasing her, Mr. Krabs puts her in the prison cell.] Join me, Krabs! We'll rule the seven seas together!
Mr. Krabs: I can't let you go, lass. That'll be violation of the naval code. Enjoy your last meal. I hope you like sponge-sugar! [Mr. Krabs winks at her as he gives her a pie. The pirate captain begins to eat the pie and finds something in it.]
Pirate Captain: Huh? [It turns out to be the candy-key he made earlier.] Oh! [She giggles as she and Mr. Krabs wink at Ensign, who made a cotton candy sculpture of the Statue of Liberty. Then it cuts back to the Krusty Krab with Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob winking at each other.]
Squidward: What are we all winking about?
SpongeBob: I don't know! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs continues to wink, much to Squidward's annoyance.]


SpongeBob: Founders Day is here today, Squidward is this even?
Squidward: [SpongeBob is trying to put up a banner] A little higher. A little to the left. A little more to the left.[SpongeBob falls over] Ha- Perfect! [A barrel rolls along the floor, hits a ladder which hits a table into Squidward's head] Oww.
SpongeBob: [Mr. Krabs emerges from his office very happy, playing a concertina] Wow, Mr. Krabs really loves Founder's Day!
Squidward: [crossly] No, he doesn't!
SpongeBob: But just look at him go!
Squidward: This is the day he gets the patty orders for the big Founder's Day eating contest, it's the most money Krabs makes all year.
SpongeBob: Well it's not just that, Mr. Krabs has a lot of love in his heart for this town.
Mr. Krabs: [slides down the rail] Nope, Squidward's right. Not only do I supply the Eating Contest but I get to sell my profilating patties to all the hungry spectators! I had to grease a few wheels but it was worth it. [Cuts to flashback]
Commissioner: Thanks Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, Mr. Commissioner! See you at Founders' Day! [Mr. Krabs coughs after the commissioner drives off and smokes hits his mouth. Cuts out of flashback]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Oh, I wonder wonder wonder how many Patties must be made♪
Squidward: Wonder no longer, you only need one.
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] ♪rednow rednow rednow I, ho. edam eb tsum seittap♪ [Grabs Squidward] What do you mean one?!
Squidward: Didn't you see today's newspaper?[Shows Mr. Krabs the paper]
Mr. Krabs: [Reads paper] "No takers for 'McNulty Challenge'". Ha! What's that suppose to mean?
Squidward: He's the current champion. He only needs to eat one patty to win.
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] I'm ruined! No-one wants to see a one Krabby Patty Eating Contest, least of all me wallet. [Starts crying]
SpongeBob: Hey at least we have Founders Day!
Mr. Krabs: I couldn't give a seafit for Founders Day. I need sales boy, sales is what I need. Oh if only there was someone dumb and hungry enough to take on Ol' Oswald McNulty.
Patrick: [Walks by humming]
Patrick: [Stupidly talking to a broom] I'll just have 47 Krabby Patties, please. I had a big breakfast so I'm not that hungry. [Patrick grabs the broom.] Squidward did you get a new haircut?
Mr. Krabs: Ah! Dumb and hungry. Well, if it isn't Patrick!
Patrick: I isn't Patrick?
Mr. Krabs: No, no of course you are! How would you like to eat as many Krabby Patties as you can handle and restore the honor of your home town.
Patrick: I like the first part but I don't understand the second part.
Mr. Krabs: I'm talking about Oswald McNulty! He comes here every year with his big city ways and his extremely relaxed throat muscles and he shows us up a bunch of rubes. Rubes! And on Founders Day no less! We need a home-town hero to make me lots of mone- I mean return the belt to Bikini Bottom! He-he, He-he. [Cuts to next scene.]
Mr. Krabs: You're going up against the best, so you have to be the best! We're gonna light a fire under you boy-o!
Patrick: [Panicking and stupidly] Ah! Oh no, that's gonna hurt!
Mr. Krabs: Listen up, Mister. No more fooling around, you're here to eat and eat and then eat some more.
Patrick: [Enthusiastically] I like to eat!
Mr. Krabs: Well let's see how your tummy handles these patties Mr. likes-to-eat.
Patrick: [Patrick starts laughing] Ha-ha-ha, you said tummy.
SpongeBob: Tummies! Ha-ha-ha [Mr. Krabs blows whistle]
Patrick: [Enthusiastically] I like whistles!
Mr. Krabs: Eat!
[Mr. Krabs starts the timer and Patrick takes a Krabby Patty and starts sniffing it and then eats it slowly.]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doin'? Your wastin' time!
Patrick: Gotta warm up my taste buds first. [shows Patrick's mouth then shows his taste buds cheering and they take the bits of Krabby Patty he eats.]
Mr. Krabs: Son, can you eat faster?
Patrick: Oh, faster? [Mr. Krabs starts the timer again and Patrick starts eating faster]
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs stops timer.] Four and a half patties in one minute! Well McNulty can eat a hundred in a minute! But you know I think your teeth might be getting in the way a little bit-
Patrick: Oh, why didn't you say so. [Patrick takes out his teeth.]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, I didn't know you had false teeth.
Patrick: [laughs] I don't
Mr. Krabs: Nah, that can't be it, McNulty has teeth. SpongeBob! Let's go to the film. [SpongeBob turns on film projector and shows McNulty eating Krabby Patties.]
Mr. Krabs: Look at that devious face, a face without pity, cold dead eyes, like a sharks eyes. What is Oswald McNulty doin' that Patrick Star is not!
Patrick: His homework?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Or maybe we should be asking what Oswald McNulty is not doing.
SpongeBob: His taxes?
Mr. Krabs: Your both wrong! Or possibly right, I mean I don't know much about his personal life, the point is, he's not tasting boys, [shows McNulty's taste buds which aren't in use.] That's where Oswald McNulty has  the edge! Those extra seconds you take to taste a patty Patrick, are slowing you down! From now on [grabs Patrick's head and puts a patty in his mouth and puts his head down to swallow it.] You must put them in yer mouth, then swallow!
Patrick: [sadly] I don't get to taste?
SpongeBob: [worriedly] This feels wrong Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [Sternly] Don't act bad bucket boy, we're gonna need a hundred more patties.
SpongeBob: Okay, i'll get right on it. [walks away.]
Mr. Krabs: We're gonna teach this sea star, a new way to eat! Without tasting. [Mr. Krabs pulls out Patrick's tongue then it shows his taste buds crying, then the scene cuts to Patrick starting training and eating patties.]
Fred: There he goes!
Thaddeus: Our champion!
Sadie: He's so dreamy! [one of them fall over]
[everybody is cheering for him.]
Mr. Krabs: [while throwing Krabby Patties to Patrick] Come one, come all! This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! It's a Founders Day extravaganza! Watch our home town hero, Patrick Star, take on the down the beloved champion from three towns over, Oswald McNulty! And see who takes, The Patty Belt!
Diner Fish: Say, can my little boy ask you something?
Boy with a Broken Foot: Are you the brave man that's gonna bring the belt back to Bikini Bottom?
Patrick: [Tries to say something but can't cause he's eating a Krabby Patty and then he gets some of the patty he was chewing on the two fish.]
Diner Fish: Inspiring words!
Boy with a Broken Foot: I hurted my foot on the playground.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, that's wonderful, move back. Be sure to bring your friends! [they drive away and it bubble transitions to The Krusty Krab with a big crowd cheering and the contest is about to happen, then two guards bring Oswald McNulty and every one starts booing.]
Boy with a Broken Foot: Dad, is that the bad man who took the belt away from Bikini Bottom?
Diner Fish: Yes it is son. [both start booing.]
Perch Perkins: Looks like this crowd is hungry! For excitement that is, and also possibly food, any moment now these doors will open on what promises to be the most dynamic patty eating contest, in Founders Day history.
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patties, T-shirts, conical hats, and, Patrick's chompers!
Perch Perkins: Today, our local hero, Patrick Star, the courageous underdog, is going against five time belt winner, Oswald McNulty from three towns over, one can only imagine the seeding tension pulling over right now, between these two titans of the sport, as they prepare for ultimate battle.
Patrick: [Scene cuts inside Krusty Krab where Patrick and Oswald are sitting casually from each other] Hey.
Oswald McNulty: How's it going.
[SpongeBob and Squidward bring out the Krabby Patties.]
Perch Perkins: [holds a plate of Krabby Patties.] Five short minutes to consume as many patties as they can.
SpongeBob: Who's ready!
Patrick: SpongeBob, I don't wanna do this.
SpongeBob: Well then don't do it, i'm sure Mr. Krabs will understand.
Mr. Krabs: [sniffing.] I smell mutiny, what's going on here?
Patrick: I don't want to eat in the contest it hurts my taste feelings. [points to his tongue and his taste buds are crying.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no problem, [pulls out a paper] here.
Patrick: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: That, is a bill, for all those Krabby Patties you ate during training. [drops bill on the table for it to roll out very long, and the crowd is cheering.]
Patrick: But I didn't know I had to pay!
Mr. Krabs: Well I didn't know either until you decided you weren't doing the contest, and that means all your training patties, just became plain, eating patties. Now if you was to do the contest, I might be inclined to tear up this here little bill, and of course, there are all the people counting on you son. [Mr. Krabs points to the crowd and the Boy with a Broken Foot.]
Boy with a Broken Foot: Ow, my foot. [Patrick looks at him and feels sad.]
Patrick: Okay, i'll do it for the little boy with the hurt foot.
Mr. Krabs: [tearing the bill.] You made the right choice kid! [laughs and then Squidward rings the bell.]
Perch Perkins: There's the bell! And we're off and eating. [McNulty starts eating] McNulty taking an early lead and really going to work with those patties, what a dynamo! A little skull from three towns over eating at a terrific pace! But what's this? [shows Patrick struggling to eat a single Krabby Patty.] Patrick Star isn't moving, he seems stuck in the gate!
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing Patrick? Don't make me charge you for those patties too!
Perch Perkins: McNulty is pressing forward, looks like this is gonna be a blowout!
Boy with a Broken Foot: Patrick, [wearing Patrick merchandise] I believe in you Patrick. [Patrick is about to cry but he then starts eating.]
Perch Perkins: But wait! Patrick Star is on the move, patties are starting to disappear, look at that little sea star eat! He's inching closer to McNulty, and it look like McNulty can feel the heat, never have there been a more pretentious display of competitive eating! The amount of patties being consumed is astounding. [Patrick finishes a whole plate of patties and is starting to suck everything in.] And now, yes, yes! Patrick Star has matched Oswald McNulty! And they are tied as they come into the home stretch! Both eaters are so full they could barely eat but eat they do, moving so slowly now. One can't help but wonder if they are going to hit the patty wall at some point. And, and, [both McNulty and Patrick stop eating and fall on the table.] Both eaters have stopped! With only seconds left, we are tied in patties eaten, and neither one seems to have the room to go on! Oh! What is this? [McNulty falls down.] And down goes McNulty, down goes McNulty! [the crowd is cheering] It looks like we do have a tie!
Patrick: It's over SpongeBob, I can't go on.
SpongeBob: The taste, Patrick, [pulls Patrick's tongue and slaps it.] Remember the taste!
Patrick: The taste. [Patrick gets up and stands on the table pointing.]
Perch Perkins: What's this? Patrick Star has risen from his seat, and is pointing to center field, [points somewhere else.] No wait! He's pointing to a little boy with a hurt foot. [Patrick points to his mouth.] Ladies and gentleman, he's pointing to his mouth, as if to indicate something.
Boy with a Broken Foot: [holds out a Krabby Patty.] Here you go champ, you can have one. [Patrick sticks his tongue out and  the boy puts the Krabby Patty in his mouth and his taste buds carry it to his mouth, and then he eats and finishes it.]
Perch Perkins: And, he's eating! He's eating! The Great Starbino, is eating! [Patrick's nine hundred ninety nine became a thousand and broke the counting machine, and the crowd is cheering.] Patrick Star wins! The belt is back in Bikini Bottom! The belt is back in Bikini Bottom!
Commissioner: Here you go son, you earned it fat and square. [Patrick holds up the belt and puts it on]
Perch Perkins: Congratulations, Starbino. So, are you gonna defend the belt next year?
Patrick: No, this thing doesn't even fit! [ tries to get it off and then shoots off of him and hits the Boy with a Broken Foot.]
Boy with a Broken Foot: Ow! My other foot.
[the screen fades to black and then the episode ends.]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick, who are seen playing a board game between Patrick's rock and Squidward's house.]
Patrick: I don't get it! What's an audit?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Let me check the rules. [drops the giant rule book on the ground, opening it] Playing "Certified Public Accountant" isn't as much fun as I thought. [he slides the book away] Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!
Patrick: [grabs the dice, shaking it] [screaming] I am rolling the dice! [he rolls the dice] [screaming] now I am moving! [he picks up a piece and puts it in another spot, picking up a card while screaming] "Run... spreadsheets?" 
SpongeBob: What does that even mean?! [screaming] [As SpongeBob is talking, the screen goes over to Squidward, who is sunbathing. Squidward, annoyed by their shouting, turns up the volume on his iPod.]
Patrick: [screaming] Well, maybe I’m supposed to run around with this sheet we spread on the ground!
SpongeBob:  [screaming] Yeah, that sounds right to me!
[Patrick flips the sheet and all the pieces to the game fall on Squidward. Squidward gets irritated as Patrick runs around with the sheet while SpongeBob laughs.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Wanna play "Certified Public Accountant" with us?
Squidward: Oh, let me think. That sounds so, [yells] no!
[Patrick keeps running around with the sheet until he trips on the game board.]
Patrick: I don't think this game is ripe.
SpongeBob: Yeah, maybe it got picked too soon.
Squidward: [scoffs] What? Do you think that games grow on trees? [laughs]
Patrick: Doesn't everything grow on trees?
Squidward: No, you ninny! Somebody makes them.
Patrick: Makes them?
Squidward: Yeah. Somebody thinks up the game, then they make the game.
Patrick: Then I could make a game?
Squidward: No, you couldn't. You would be incapable.
SpongeBob: Well, I think Patrick could make up a game.
Squidward: Your operative word there is “think.”
Patrick: Yeah! The opernive... word is think! [laughs] Thanks, Squidward! I'll do it!
SpongeBob: Go get'em, Patrick!
Squidward: [sighs as he rubs his head] Double morons.
[The scene changes to Squidward at the Krusty Krab. Patrick comes in.]
Patrick: I invented a game! I invented a game!
Squidward: Whoopee. Do tell.
Patrick: Well, you know how hard "Tic-Tac-Toe" is and how it always takes so long to play?
Squidward: Uh-huh.
Patrick: Yeah! Well, I made it easier and faster!
Squidward: [sighs] I know I'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but what have you got?
Patrick: It's called... [Patrick holds out a notebook] "Tic-Tac"! You start with two lines that are crossed. And then the first person puts an X. And then the next person puts an, uh... [thinks]
Squidward: O?
Patrick: Oh, yeah! An O! And the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, "Tic-Tac"!. [rips off the paper and laughs] You start!
[Squidward draws an X then Patrick draws an O. Squidward draws another X and draws a line through them.]
Squidward: Tic-Tac.
Patrick: Uh... [rips off paper] Best two out of four?
French Narrator: Many Tic-Tacs later...
[Squidward and Patrick had been playing "Tic-Tac" for a while. As they played one more time, Patrick becomes worried as Squidward draws in the notebook.]
Squidward: Tic and Tac.
Patrick: I should've gone with my first idea: "Tic".
[The scene changes to Squidward riding his recumbent bicycle. Patrick runs up to him.]
Patrick: Squidward, I got a new game! It's called "Rock, Paper, Butter"!
[Patrick holds out a stick of butter melting in his hand.]
Squidward: Butter invent a different game! [laughs]
[Squidward rides away as Patrick eats the stick of butter and sulks sadly back home. The scene changes to Squidward watering his garden. Patrick shows up with two ropes. A long one and a short one.]
Patrick: Squidward, I got it! [throws the ropes on the ground] Whose rope is longer? You... [Squidward picks up the long rope before Patrick finishes] Aww! You played this before!
[Patrick walks away angrily. The scene changes to Sandy's treedome.]
Patrick: Sandy, I've been trying to invent a game, but every game I invent is a failure.
Sandy: [puts some stuff in her blender] If you want to invent a game, you should study all the games you like and figure out what it is you liked best about them. [mixes her blender] Then you can use those elements in the game you invent. [drinks the smoothie she made from her blender]
[Mini Brain Patrick pops out of Patrick's eye and throws a light bulb above his head. Once Mini Brain Patrick puts Patrick eye back in place, Patrick pulled the rope and lights up the light bulb, which helped him get an idea.]
Patrick: [gasps] I know what to do!
[The scene changes to Patrick's rock and all of Patrick's board games are stacks on a table.]
Patrick: And so it begins.
[Patrick begins creating his game. First, he takes a game piece, puts glue on it, and adds google eyes. Then he cuts a board game in half with the scissors, which resulted in cutting himself in half. Then he glues the board together and puts some tape on it. However, the tape slides off because the glue was still wet, but Patrick didn't mind. Patrick continued working on his game for a few hours, and by the time he was finished, he pulled the lever and electricity starts bringing the game to life as if he was a mad scientist bringing a robot to life in a horror movie.]
Patrick: [laughs maniacally] It's a game! It's a game! Now I know what it's like to be a game maker!
[The scene changes to Sandy, Squidward and SpongeBob walking to Patrick's place at night.]
Squidward: I don't see the point of this game night. Every game that Patrick has "invented" is more pointless and boring than the last.
Sandy: This time, he did research.
Squidward: Well, if it's started, then I'm already bored.
Sandy: Well, I'm excited! We're gonna be the first people to test out Patrick's game!
SpongeBob: This is gonna be written about in the history book someday.
Squidward: Yeah. In crayon.
[Everyone shows up at Patrick's rock and Patrick comes out.]
Patrick: Good evening. Please step into my gamatourium.
[Everyone steps inside Patrick's rock.]
Squidward: More like a lamatourium. Ha.
[Patrick closes the rock and lands on his chair.]
Patrick: Welcome, gamers! And behold! [thunderclaps] My game!
[Patrick's game board is made out of random board games and is shaped like Patrick himself.]
SpongeBob: It's beautiful!
Squidward: [yawns] Are we finished? Who won? [Sandy, disgusted by Squidward's rude behavior, hits Squidward's arm]
Patrick: [laughs] No, my friend. We have only just begun.
Sandy: What's it called, Patrick?
Squidward: Might I suggest "garbage"? [Sandy growls at Squidward] What?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick. What's it called?
[As Patrick thinks, Mini Brain Patrick pushes a light bulb out of his head and it lights up.]
Patrick: It's called... Patrick! The Game! [thunderclaps]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Squidward: Could we just get started already? I'm late for my coma. [Sandy zips Squidward's mouth shut]
Patrick: Alright! [eats some snacks] I'll explain the rules. Each player picks a piece to move around the board. The way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice. [As Patrick explains, Sandy and SpongeBob are amazed. But Squidward, on the other hand, was getting impatient] To decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be...
Squidward: Look, Patrick! You go, then Sandy, then SpongeBob, then me! Okay?
Patrick: You mean for picking our player or for starting the game?
Squidward: [annoyed] Both!
Patrick: Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game.
Squidward: I've got a great idea. Why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play.
Patrick: Hmm... [thinks] Okay! [Patrick rolls the dice and gets three dots. He moves his game piece and lands on free money.] Oh, money! [throw money in the air]
[Sandy rolls the dice, moves her game piece and lands on Goo Lagoon.]
Sandy: Yee-haw! Beachfront property! [places a house-shaped piece on Goo Lagoon]
[SpongeBob rolls the dice and gets four dots. He moves his game piece and lands on a treasure chest. SpongeBob takes a treasure which has diver's license on it.]
SpongeBob: Driver's license! Driver's license! But what does that mean?
Patrick: Oh, on your next turn, you roll then you can move down the board or you can go round the race track as many times as you rolled.
SpongeBob: Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do?
Squidward: Could you give me the dice? Give me the dice? Because it's my turn!
[Squidward rolls the dice and gets six dots. Squidward moves his game piece and lands on "Go to jail".]
Squidward: Uh-huh.
Patrick: You go to jail.
[Patrick puts a cardboard box with the word jail on it. Everyone laughs at Squidward as a blue fish head appears next to him.]
Blue Cellmate: What are you in for, pal?
Patrick: My turn! [rolls the dice and spits it out of his mouth] One... two...
[Patrick moves his piece to snacks. Once it landed, snack pops out and feeds Patrick.]
Squidward: Oh, good thing you've landed on snacks. You must be famished.
[Sandy rolls the dice and gets two dots. She moves her piece to Coral Avenue.]
Sandy: Hmm... Coral Avenue. I'll buy it!
[Sandy hands out her money while SpongeBob rolls the dice.]
SpongeBob: Twelve. I'll... drive the car!
[Squidward rolls the dice.]
Patrick: Oh, you don't get to roll when you're in jail.
Squidward: Well, what do I do to get out of jail?
Patrick: You have to roll a six.
[Squidward rolls the dice again.]
Patrick: [screaming angrily] Hey! you can't roll the dice when you're in jail!
SpongeBob: Yeah, play by the rules.
Squidward: Well, if the only way to get out of jail is to roll a six, and I can't roll if I'm in jail, just how am I supposed to get out of jail?! Grrr!
Patrick: [Patrick pulls out a rule card.] Ah, here it is! [writes on it] The guy that is in jail has to stay there unless he rolls a six or someone says his name.
Squidward: [calmly] Fine. Someone say my name.
[Everyone laughs at Squidward. Sandy rolls the dice and moves her piece to surgery.]
Patrick: Oh boy! You landed on "Do a Surgery"! [Patrick holds cards while wearing an operation mask.] Now, pick a surgery card.
Sandy: [Sandy takes a card] Hmm... Remove finbone from player to your left.
[Patrick grabs Squidward and puts him on the game board.]
Squidward: What? Wait! No! But I don't have a finbone! I'm an octopus!
Sandy: Hush, now! This won't hurt a bit.
[Sandy takes the tweezers and removes a plastic bone from the game board.]
Sandy: Got it.
Patrick: Now, sit back down, you criminal!
Squidward: Oh, this game doesn't make any sense!
SpongeBob: Sounds like someone's mad because he hasn't moved.
Squidward: Well, neither have you.
[SpongeBob puts a driving helmet on and starts riding on the board with the race car toy.]
Squidward: [takes off the cardboard box] That's it! I've had enough!
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward! Wait!
Sandy: Don't go, Squidward!
Patrick: No wait, Squidward!
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Patrick: Wait, how'd he get out of jail?
SpongeBob: Squidward made us say his name.
Sandy: That was a smart move, Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? Oh. Hmm... [thinks for a bit and goes back to playing]
SpongeBob: Now you roll after me.
[SpongeBob rolls the dice and gets five dots.]
SpongeBob: Five. One, two, three, four, five. Um, I think I'll...
Squidward: Race the car.
SpongeBob: I'll...
Squidward: Race the car!
SpongeBob: I'll... race the car!
[SpongeBob puts the driving helmet back on and races around the track again. Squidward rolls the dice and gets two dots.]
Squidward: Oh boy! Snacks!
[He moves his piece and lands on snacks. SpongeBob continues racing on the track but his movements literally makes Squidward's piece go back to jail.]
Patrick: Jail for Squidward!
Squidward: But I was on snacks!
Patrick: Tell it to the judge!
[Patrick puts the cardboard box back on Squidward.]
Squidward: Could someone please tell me what we are supposed to be doing? What's the point? This entire game is completely random! It jumps from one thing to another! I don't know how you are supposed to win! And Patrick seems to be making up the rules as he goes along!
Patrick: Starving! Starving sea star time!
[Sandy and SpongeBob feeds Patrick random snacks.]
Squidward: [takes off the box] Okay, I'm going outside.
Patrick: [Patrick writes on his rule card.] If a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside.
Squidward: But I didn't say "outsidies" I said...
[Everyone pushes Squidward outside of Patrick's rock. Patrick rolls the dice and gets four dots.]
Patrick: Four. We are in a giggle zone! Everyone laugh!
[Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick laughs. Sandy growls at Squidward to make him join.]
Squidward: Ha.
[SpongeBob rolls the dice and gets two dots.]
SpongeBob: Two. [takes a card] Silly face! Silly face!
[Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick make silly faces, but Squidward gets very irritated.]
Sandy: Now, that's a silly face!
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, you finally understand the rules!
Squidward: Oh, I get the rules alright! The rules are that it doesn't matter what anybody rolls! You can just make up whatever it means! [takes the dice and rolls them] So, I could just roll the dice and say, "Automatic Winner!"
SpongeBob: Good job, Squidward! You've won!
Sandy: Nice play, Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? Oh, you know what, you're right. That was a good play.
Patrick: Not so fast! [writes on his rule card] No player may declare himself "Automatic Winner."
Squidward: You did it again. You made up another rule! This game is the worst! Stupid game!
[Spongbob and Sandy run off while Squidward grabs Patrick's game board and shakes it off of Patrick. Then he throws Patrick in the air and when Patrick landed, the game breaks in half. Squidward then puts a piece of the game board in his mouth and shakes his head like a dog. He stomps on it with both feet out of insane anger. However, the police arrives at the scene.]
Highway Speed Patrol: Destruction to private property.
[Patrick writes on his rule card and gives it to the police. Squidward tries to walk away but Nancy O'Malley and the Highway Speed Patrol follow him.]
Highway Speed Patrol: Oh, and I see here you are a repeat offender. You're going to real jail.
[Nancy O'Malley and the Highway Speed Patrol grab Squidward and threw him in the police car.]
Squidward: Anything to get out of this game! Thanks, Officers!
Blue Cellmate: Welcome back!
Squidward: Somebody say my name!
[The police car drives away as the episode ends with Patrick appearing on a game board box.]
Patrick: Game over!


[pans out from Mermaid Man &amp; Barnacle Boy "The Dark Tide Rises" poster]
SpongeBob: Wow! Another Mermaid Man reboot. It's how I always re-imagined the reboot would be remade,
[wind blows]
SpongeBob: [shivers] Oh, cold knees!
[Salesfish drives by, then parks his boat and jumps out with a suitcase]
Salesfish: Well you see you got cold knees, icy joints, Siberian patellas? What you need is a pair of longpants!
SpongeBob: Longpants? [twists around looking at the pants spin around him] Well, I don't think I'm ready for looong pants.
Salesfish: Nonsense, no fellers you walk around with shiver shins! [shows SpongeBob's knees with icicles popping out] Give yourself something to leg up [pulls SpongeBob's legs] Join the trouser troupe! [three businessmen marching and hutting] Don't be a slacker, wear slacks!
SpongeBob: Uh..well..I don't...uhhh...Okay! [peels off his old pants and jumps into the longpants] How do I look?
Salesfish: [takes hat off] Excuse me, sir, I was just talking to a little baby schoolboy a second ago, about yay high and...[puts hat on and jumps up] [stutters] It's you! I didn't recognize you with your mature, grownup longpants!
SpongeBob: You're pulling my leg, sir, I don't look like a man! Do I?
Patrick: Hey, man!
SpongeBob: [jumps] He called me a man! And my knees are a perfect 72 degrees! [pulls out wallet and hands salesfish money]
Salesfish: [walks away with money, bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]
Customers: [gasp, talking about SpongeBob's pants while SpongeBob is walking to his workstation]
Customer's son: Is that my daddy?
Customer's mother: I wish! [gawking at SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, excuse me, sir, that door is for employees only, ohh! It's SpongeBob! [sniffs SpongeBob] There's something different about you today? You seem more, able bodied.
SpongeBob: Yah, it must be the long pants! [in manly tone]
Mr. Krabs: So they are! You'll run the register today! [grabs Squidward] Into the galley with you, Mr. Squidward, and start cooking!
Squidward: [sadly] But, Mr. Krabs? Why?
Mr. Krabs: Well, look, SpongeBob's got longpants on and you've got.. none! [Krustomers ooh]
Squidward: [covers himself, Mr. Krabs throw Squidward into the kitchen, glass shatters, bubble transitions to SpongeBob at the register]
SpongeBob: Ohh! I could get used to this job! Hey Squidward what's on sale this week?
Squidward: Nothing, there is never a sale.
SpongeBob: [pokes head through the serving window] Squidward, how much is the senior discount?
Squidward: There's no senior discount! [looks at burning patties, throws patty onto foot, burns his foot, and grunting and hitting and breaking everything because of the pain]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: [screams] What?!
SpongeBob: What do I do when the register is $2000 dollars short?
Mr. Krabs: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Alright, alright, that's enough! [picks up SpongeBob and puts him outside of the register] I see it was a mistake to put you behind the register! You’re just looking to good for such a simple meaning of work!
Squidward: [grunts angrily]
Mr. Krabs: You should be the maitre'd! Greeting customers when they come in! Charming the pants off of everyone with your longpants!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay! [walks around Krusty Krab, saying hi to everyone] How is that patty treating you, sir? [teeth glisten]
Blue customer: You're an angel!
SpongeBob: No, merely a man, a man in longpants. [elderly spits out soda, missing the longpants, people are spitting food everywhere, just missing SpongeBob's pants, until a ketchup drop stains his pantleg] Oh, my precious longpants!
Mr. Krabs: What's wrong, slick? Your not having trouble with your pants, are ye?
SpongeBob: Nothing like that, Mr. Krabs. I just don't think I'm maitre'd material.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, you're right, you're too good for this place. [two customers burp]
SpongeBob: As much as I hate to admit it, I've outgrown the Krusty Krab. Time for me to move on! [pulls up pants, leaves The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Where's he going?
Mr. Krabs: A place called... manhood. [bubble transitions to SpongeBob walking on the streets]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Doris, I insist! [puts hand on check]
Doris: Don't be silly!
SpongeBob: Allow me, ladies, I should pay, after all, I am a man, and I'm wearing...[whistles, points at longpants]
Nancy Suzy Fish: What an inseam!
Doris: And those pleats were pretty easy on the eyes!
SpongeBob: [boat splashes water on his pants] AH! Shrimp! Oh, dry cleaning, and one hour! [walks into dry cleaners]
Dave: Uh, ticket please.
SpongeBob: Has it all ready been one hour? One more time! [goes back into the dry cleaning cycle, bubble transitions to SpongeBob at a window, with SpongeBob looking at himself, whistles] Huh? [click, car stops]
Driving Instructor: Congratulations, you passed your driving test!
Mable Jenkins/Lobster: Wahoo!
SpongeBob: You know, I've never took the drivers test with long pants! I'll do it!
Alternate Universe SpongeBob: There goes a real man! [bubble transition to SpongeBob taken the drivers test]
Driving Instructor: Let's try parallel parking. [SpongeBob trying to parallel park] Now take it slow! A little faster?! [SpongeBob crashes into a boat, and then backs up and crashes into the boat behind him several times, driving instructor grunts]
SpongeBob: Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this! [boat is upside-down and is on top of another boat]
Driving Instructor: I was gonna fail you, and send you to jail, but because of those longpants, and all the blood rushing to my head, you passed! [hands SpongeBob his license]
SpongeBob: I finally got my drivers license!
Mrs. Puff: [puffs up, sirens wailing] Lock your doors, bar your windows, it's the end of the world! [bubble transition to Fancy! restaurant]
SpongeBob: Help wanted? Now this seems like a longpants establishment! [takes off tie, puts on bowtie] [talking to customers] Today's special is a most amusing indian ocean seagrass, handpicked by indigenous prawns, pre-chewed by local manatees, and smothered in a rich, red algae.
Fancy Fish: Extraordinary. And may I add that those are very impressive breeches you are wearing.
SpongeBob: Breeches? [laughs] Oh, oh, these old things?
Fancy Fish: What is your name?
SpongeBob: SpongeBob!
Fancy! Employee: [grunts]
SpongeBob: 'Oh, [distinguished accent] SpongeRobert.
Fancy Fish: Well, SpongeRobert, how would you like to join us. We're going to a party.
SpongeBob: Boy, would I! I love parties! [Fancy fish and SpongeBob laughing distinguishably, bubble transition to fancy fish house] [SpongeBob looking around]
Fancy Fish: What are you looking for, SpongeRobert?
SpongeBob: I'm looking for the party!
Fancy Fish: This is the party.
SpongeBob: [puts on party hat] Well, were's all the party hats, where's the cake, and the clown? You can't have a party without a clown!
Fancy Fish: [fancy fish and the other fancy fish laughing] Oh, SpongeRobert, if it weren't for your pants, I'd take you for the type of immature ignaramus that would frequent the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: Wait, what's that? [car with poster on back drives by] The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie is opening tonight! Wow! I totally forgot! [goes back inside] Hey guys, I got an idea! Let's all go to the Mermaid Man movie!
Fancy Fish: [laughs] You're incorrigible! But le cinema is a delightful idea. There is a foreign film at the arthouse I've been meaning to see. It's called, "The Table." [jumpshots to the Seven Seas Cinema, and "The Table"]
SpongeBob: I don't get it. We have been staring at this table for three hours. That table could use a cleaning.
Squidward: SHH! Some people are trying to enjoy le cinema.
SpongeBob: Oh! Hey Squidward! Hey, do you understand what this movie is about?
Squidward: Nobody does, it's art, now sit down!
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward?
Squidward: [loudly] WHAT?!
SpongeBob: Are you remembering to flip the patties clockwise? It's very important because the heat..
Squidward: [really loud] PLEASE SIT DOWN!
[SpongeBob sits back down in his seat.]
Movie Theater Attendant: [shines a flashlight in Squidward's face] I'm sorry sir, you're being too loud. I am going to have to ask you to leave.
Squidward: [grumbling as he is walking away]
SpongeBob: Oh, wait, Squidward, I'll walk you out. [Squidward continues to grumble as he exits the theater] Squidward!
Sandy: Hey SpongeBob, y'all going to see the Mermaid Man movie with us?
Fancy Fish: SpongeRobert? Yoohoo? Are you coming? We're going to drink some more coffee and watch the nightly news.
Sandy: Wow, that sounds pretty grown up, SpongeRobert! [mockingly]
SpongeBob: My pants say yes, yes, yes, but my heart says no! I want to see the Mermaid Man movie!
Fancy Fish: [laughs] Now you really sound like one of those nitwits that frequents the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: Not only am I one of those nitwits, I actually work there! [puts on Krusty Krab Hat and hold up dirty Spatula]
Fancy Fish: Ahh! A peasant in longpants!
Pink Fancy Fish: Social-climbing sponge!
Blue Fancy Fish: Poser!
Fancy Fish: Let's leave this bottomfeeder.
Sandy: That-a-boy! I got you a ticket just in case!
SpongeBob: [gasp] Really! [Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick give ticketman their tickets, and enter the movie theatre, but SpongeBob is stopped]
Ticketman: I'm sorry, you can't come in. This movie is too silly for a cultivated gentleman of your pants length. House rules! [SpongeBob walks over to movie poster]
SpongeBob: What? Rated for those in knee-highs only? Doh! I hate these pants! [tries to undo zipper, grunts while doing] [SpongeBob runs to a parking meter and puts his longpants on it, and and stretches his pants] Get off! [a car hits his elongated pants] Oh!, now I know I'm an adult because I've been ripped off by these defective pants! [cries, Mr. Krabs comes out of the movie theater]
Mr. Krabs: What's goin' on? How pathetic, a man, in longpants, crying.
SpongeBob: [sobbing voice] Mr. Krabs, why aren't you watching the movie?
Mr. Krabs: How can I watch the movie with all this blubbering going on out here?
SpongeBob: [regular voice] Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm not ready for long pants, I want my short pants back, but I can't because these are stuck on me.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, for Pete's sake. [uses his pinchers to snap of SpongeBob's legs, knee down] Sorry 'bout the legs boyo.
SpongeBob: [laughs] It's okay! I'm a sponge, remember? [legs grow back]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Well, good! Now, I want you back on the grill tomorrow morning. And if it makes you feel anymore manly, you can do your grilling outdoors!
SpongeBob: Sounds great! And I'll be driving to work.
Driving Instructor: Wait a minute! [he drives up] Oh no you don't! Not with those short pants! [takes the driving license and rips it up]
Mrs. Puff: [in her bedroom with rations and in hunting outfit, shrinks back] I don't know what that was all about, but I'm glad it's over.


[The episode opens with the crowd attending the grand opening of Larry's Gym.]
Larry: What you see before you is the culmination of my lifelong dream! A place of my own where I can work out everyday and anytime I want, Larry's Gym!
[The crowd is cheering again. Larry pulls out some scissors and cuts the ribbon. Then he throws the scissors away.]
Larry: Looking out at this sea of plastic muscles and sagging flesh. Frankly, I'm disgusted.
[The crowd appear in flappy looks.]
Crowd: Awwww!
Larry: Therefore, I'm now opening the gym to everyone in Bikini Bottom!
[The crowd cheers for the third time.]
Larry: For the price of a lifetime membership!
[Larry points to the lifetime membership booth.]
Crowd: Awww! [looks down]
Larry: But today everything is free!
[The crowd cheers and runs into gym.]
Larry's #1 Fan: Shape us and mold us in your image!
Frankie Billy: [appears with scissors through his head] You're the lobster, Larry! The Alpha Lobster!
Larry: Well, I don't know if I'll say that! [buffs up]
Lloyd-Rich: Oh, I filled out a membership form! [hands form to Larry]
Nat Peterson: Me too! [hands form to Larry]
Larry: What's in that pink box?
Nat Peterson: Um, donuts sir?
[Larry throws away the box of donuts.]
Larry: Do-nut brings those in here! In the meantime, enjoy yourself because your first visit is free!
[Mr. Krabs magically appears out of nowhere.]
Mr. Krabs: Is it true that everything is free?
Larry: That's right, sir! For your first visit we-
[Mr. Krabs runs off and disappears.]
Larry: Hello? In conclusion, I'm at your service to turn anyone anyone into a ripped heap of muscle glory! [buffs up once more]  
[SpongeBob is struggling to open the doors.]
Larry: Boy, I've got my work cut out for me.
[SpongeBob gets his hands stuck inside of the doors.]
Larry: The doors are automatic. Just step on the mat.
SpongeBob: Oh!
[SpongeBob jumps up and down trying to activate the automatic door.]
Larry: [grunts] Here!
[Larry steps on the mat and opens the door.]
SpongeBob: Aah! Thanks, Larry!
[Larry sighs and notices Mr. Krabs carrying an exercise bicycle on his back as he leaves the gym.]
Larry: Uh, what are you doing?
Mr. Krabs: You said everything was free.
Larry: [laughs] No, no. Your first visit is free.
Mr. Krabs: So what you're saying is if I never leave, it will be free forever!
[Mr. Krabs walks back inside with the exercise bicycle.]
Larry: [laughs] Time to go live the dream! Right after I... file this paperwork.
[Close-up of paperwork.]
Larry: [while reading some of the paperwork] I didn't think there'd be so much of it.
[Larry drops his head down on the desk in disgust.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Larry. I was just working out and I was wondering. Is this normal?
[SpongeBob's legs are all cramped up. Larry freaks out.]
Larry: Even your cramps have cramps! You need to follow my number 1 rule. [pulls out water bottle] Always be hydrating.
[Larry gives SpongeBob the water bottle. As SpongeBob drinks it, his legs become straight again.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Larry. You think I'll ever be as strong as you?
Larry: Sure! [picks up SpongeBob] What kind of a gym owner would I be if I couldn't take a puny, squishy lump like you?
[SpongeBob slides off of Larry's claw.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Squishy.
Larry: [sighs] What I'm saying is I can make you a man.
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Larry: I'm gonna make you my personal project. Of course, you'll have to sign up for a lifetime membership. [holds up membership papers]
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
[Larry drops the membership papers on SpongeBob's hands and drops a pencil next to him. SpongeBob struggles to lift a pencil.]
Larry: That reminds me. You need to start hydrating right now!
[SpongeBob signs the papers at a fast pace and becomes very tired.]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir!
[SpongeBob drinks more water.]
Larry: And remember: always be hydrating!
SpongeBob: Ok, I will!
[SpongeBob drinks more water at a fast pace.]
Larry: That's what I like to see! Come on, we'll finish those later.
SpongeBob: Good. 'Cause I was really crashing here. Signing those papers. [walks with Larry to the exercise room] Feelin' the burn? Is that what you call it? I heard Angel singing, "Beautiful Angel". That's normal, right?
Frank (muscular goldfish): It's Larry, King of the Gym!
[The crowd cheers.]
Larry: Oh, you guys. I'm just an ordinary Alpha Lobster doing his job. Towel boy!
[Frankie Billy shows up holding towels. Larry pulls out a shining crown.]
Larry: Polish this crown for me. Will you?
[Larry give Frankie Billy his crown and Frankie Billy walks off.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Join us, boy! Ho-ho! I can't believe I'm allowed to lift these... [tries to lift weights with a barbell] really heavy... pieces of metal for free!
[The heavy weight of the barbell snaps Mr. Krabs' arms and it falls on his chest.]
Mr. Krabs: Ow! Free!
[Mr. Krabs' shell breaks into pieces, revealing his pink skin and leaving Mr. Krabs dazed.]
SpongeBob: I don't know, Larry. I'm not good at lifting things.
French Narrator: Flashback...
[The flashback shows SpongeBob trying to lift a bag of snail food while feeding Gary, which ends up pulling his arms off. Then it shows SpongeBob trying to lift a bag of groceries that was given from an old lady, which also resulted in pulling his arms off. Then it showed SpongeBob trying to lift his pillow while going to bed, which also resulted in pulling his arms off. And finally, it showed SpongeBob, after warming himself up, trying to lift the pile of arms he lost, which also resulted in pulling his arms off.]
French Narrator: End of flashback...
Larry: Let me see. I may have something that'll work for you.
[Larry looks through his cabinet and picks up a box of cotton swabs.]
Larry: Here we go. Cotton swabs. [takes a cotton swab stick] Cotton balls. [sticks two cotton balls on each end] Here. Try this on for size, Hercules.
[Larry gives SpongeBob the cotton swab with the cotton balls on it. SpongeBob tries to lift it but ends up pulling his arms off.]
SpongeBob: How am I doing?
Larry: Pathetic.
SpongeBob: [talks with a jug of water in mouth] Look, Larry! I hydrating! Oh, I am hydrating so much!
[SpongeBob drinks the water from the jug.]
Larry: Yeah, I've got another idea, SpongeBob. Come with me.
[SpongeBob regrows his arms and follows Larry as he drinks the water. Larry and SpongeBob enter another exercise room.]
Larry: First thing tomorrow morning, this is gonna be where I leave my exercise class.
SpongeBob: I'll be there!
Larry: That's the spirit! And we're going to get you started early. Let me see some crunches!
[SpongeBob is seen munching on some kelpo cereal. Larry pulls the cereal box away.]
Larry: The only thing I wanna see in your mouth is that water bottle! [stuffs a water bottle in SpongeBob's mouth] Now what did I tell you? Always be hydrated! Now, I'll show you some crunches! [does sit-ups] Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow!
SpongeBob: Oh, I can do that. That's what I do when I laugh. [laughs when bending over] Only now, I'll do it on my back.
[SpongeBob flips and lands on his back. Then he does sit-ups while laughing.]
Larry: Could you do it without the laugh?
SpongeBob: I won't lie to you, Larry. Probably not. [laughs]
Larry: Whatever works I guess. Keep up with that and most importantly...
SpongeBob: Always be hydrating.
[SpongeBob sticks a jug of water on his head and does sit-ups while laughing.]
Larry: [sighs] Ok. I have a lot of paperwork to catch up on.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs rubbing a towel on himself at the front desk while Larry is working on the paperwork.]
Mr. Krabs: Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free! Free!
Larry: Do you have to do that in front of me?
Mr. Krabs: Yes! Yes I do! [throws the towel in Larry's face] Because I sincerely want to thank you for a truly life-changing experience! Sucker!
[Mr. Krabs laughs as he walks away. Larry gets off his desk and attempts to pick up the towels Mr. Krabs threw. But as he bends over, he back cracks and his belly pops out, freaking out a passing customer.]
Mr. Krabs: Nice potbelly!
Larry: Potbelly? [pokes his belly]
[Larry hears SpongeBob laughing.]
Larry: Oh, I forgot all about my prodigy.
[Larry enters the gym and a shadow creeps down on him.]
Larry: [gasps] Oh my Neptune!
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab where the hungry customers are complaining about not getting their food. In the kitchen, SpongeBob attempts to do his job as a fry cook. But due to his newly massive strength and buffed up body, everything he touches ends up getting crushed and stepped on.]
SpongeBob: Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!
[SpongeBob goes to lift the patties, but ends up lifting the stove. The stove flies out of the restaurant and lands on Frankie Billy who is driving his boat.]
Frankie Billy: My legs! [boat explodes] I'm ok! [the stove lands on him] Slightly less ok!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob walks through the wall.]
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Squidward: What are you... Whoa! You've been working out.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I hope you have some glue for me because I am ripped!
[SpongeBob's muscle punches Squidward's face. The muscles on his belly become six sponges popping up and down. The muscle on his right leg turns into a solid gold block. SpongeBob's nose reflexes.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?
Squidward: Yes! Anything you meathead! Just go before you destroy the place!
[SpongeBob runs off to Larry's gym as Squidward's face pops back out. The scene changes to people coming in and out of the gym. Larry, who is now extremely obese, is still at his desk working on his paperwork.]
SpongeBob: Larry?
[Larry stands up and all of the papers fly around.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Larry. You've really let yourself go.
Larry: With all this paperwork, I haven't had any time to do my crunches. The only thing I've been crunching is numbers. But I'm gonna get back in shape. You'll see.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Larry! Sure you will!
Larry: SpongeBob, tell me the truth. [shows SpongeBob his belly] Do I have a potbelly?
[SpongeBob freaks out a bit.]
SpongeBob: No, Larry. Don't be silly. You don't have a potbelly.
[SpongeBob is almost about to laugh but keeps his cool.]
Larry: [sighs] See you in exercise class. I guess.
[SpongeBob goes to the exercise room and Larry begins to cry in agony. As he cries, his tears fall into the opening of his round belly. Mr. Krabs shows up with a spoon.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh boy! Free soup! [tastes a sample of Larry's tears] Little heavy on the salt.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and everyone in the exercise room getting ready for class.]
SpongeBob: Oh, he'll be here. Don't worry. Larry made me the man I am today.
[The crowd murmurs in amazement.]
SpongeBob: I taught me just do stuff you'll always do, but do it on your back. Laugh on your back. [does sit-ups as he laughs]
[The crowd does the same thing.]
SpongeBob: [lays on his back and moves his legs in the air] Walk on your back.
[The crowd also does the same thing.]
SpongeBob: And don't forget. Always be hydrated. That means drink plenty of water.
[SpongeBob pours water on his head with a water bottle and the crowd did the same thing.]
SpongeBob: I hope Larry's ok. But while we're waiting, I guess we could ride bicycles on our backs.
[SpongeBob lays on his back and pretends to ride a bicycle. The crowd does the same thing. Through the window of the exercise room, a depressed Larry is watching from the outside. He thinks that SpongeBob is a well better instructor than he is and sadly walks by the steam room. Mr. Krabs pops out of the steam room.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker.
[Mr. Krabs pops back in the steam room. Larry sighs in depression and heads back to his desk. He drinks some coffee. He takes a pencil and attempts to break it. But due to is decreased muscle strength, he couldn't break it. He then tries to lift weights with another pencil but with donuts on each end. However, he couldn't do it because of his loss in muscle strength.]
Larry: Oh, what's the use.
[Larry eats a donut and drops his face flat on his desk.]
Larry: Oh, who am I kidding!
[SpongeBob arrives on an exercise bike.]
SpongeBob: You wanted to see me, sir?
Larry: Yeah. [eats other donut] Look, uh, you're obviously the alpha male at the gym now and I'm just a shell of my former self.
SpongeBob: I hear ya, Larry. I just wanna get back to the Krusty...
Larry: I need you to take over. You're a natural leader, SpongeBob. [puts the crown on SpongeBob's head] You should be in charge of the fun stuff while I sit here in the reception area slowly getting fatter and paler until I die.
SpongeBob: This sounds great.
[Larry begins to cry.]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Oh, Larry, look at me! I'm too big to work the grill anymore! That makes me sad!
Larry: Come over here and give me a bro-hug!
[The crown falls off of SpongeBob's head.]
SpongeBob: You mean a br-ug?
Larry: I don't wanna call it that.
SpongeBob: Here's to our new lives! Our terrible, terrible new lives!
[SpongeBob and Larry hug each other and cried in despair. But they hug and cry, water spews out of SpongeBob and he shrinks back to his normal size.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, what happened?
Larry: Dude, you were just overhydrated! Those weren't real muscles, they were water muscles!
SpongeBob: Larry, your br-ug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!
Larry: Don't say br-ug.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Br-ug. [laughs]
[SpongeBob slides off of Larry's claws and SpongeBob does his sit-ups while laughing. Larry does the same exact thing and in the process, his muscles begin to build up and his strength returns to normal.]
Larry: SpongeBob, laughing on my back was just what I needed! [buffs up] You're a pretty good instructor after all. [sits down] Oh boy. The way you laugh really gets on my nerves.
[SpongeBob continues to laugh as he does his sit-ups.]
French Narrator: The very next evening...
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab late at night. SpongeBob is happily flipping the patties on the grill.]
Squidward: Well, that was the last customer, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob places his two spatulas in his pockets.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what a great day.
Squidward: And you know why it was a great day? Because Krabs never even showed up.
[The scene changes to Larry's gym getting ready to close up for the night. Larry is walking by the steam room until he sees steam coming out.]
Larry: Huh? [sniffs] What is that smell? [jiggles the doorknob] Mr. Krabs, how long have you been in there?!
[Larry pulls the door off and sees Mr. Krabs as a cooked up crab on a plate with melted butter and lemons on the side, meaning that he had been in the steam room too long.]
Mr. Krabs: I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?
[The episode ends.]


[The episode begins with Sandy having a relaxing day at her treedome. When suddenly she hears a honking noise.]
Sandy: Huh?
[A package from above falls in front of her door.]
Sandy: [gasps] It's here! Yee-haw! My newest science book has arrived! I wonder what new and fantastic area of science will be revealed to me this month! [Another rock bangs her head revealing bloomers in a balloon.] Oh, hey! It's those fancy bloomers I ordered too! This day just keeps getting better! [She walks into treedome, sits at picnic table, opens box and reads her new book.] Ahh! Behavorial psychology is the study of people and their habits. I studied underwater chemistry, geology, and astronomy, but I never studied underwater people!
[The scene changes to Sandy riding on a bus. She turns on her recording device and begins analyzing.]
Sandy: Sandy Cheeks. Day one of behavioral study of subjects in Bikini Bottom. Initiating observations, [checks her watch] now!
[Sandy begins her observations as she looks carefully at the fish riding in the bus.]
Charlie: My mom says she wouldn't even try it. No matter how much I saw the lagoons.
Amanda's mother: My daughter Amanda is exactly the same. It's always an argument, but I've tried to...
[Sandy interrupts the conversation by sliding in between Fred and Charlie and begins observing.]
Sandy: Older lumpy looking female subject. Obviously, a mother. Hates daughter.
Amanda's mother: Excuse me?
Sandy: Subject asked to be excused, but I am unable to observe what she wishes to be excused from.
Fred: Hey! Creepy squirrel! What's with all the eavesdropping?
Charlie: Take a hike, mammal!
Sandy: Emotional state seems to be rising in anger. Eyebrows are now considerably furrowed.
[As she is observing, Charlie and Fred push Sandy off the seat and the driver kicks her out of the bus. Sandy lands on the ground and straightens herself out.]
Sandy: I gotta find new subjects.
[The driver throws her recorder and microphone at her head.]
Sandy: Who won't mind being observed.
[Sandy sees SpongeBob and Patrick running around playing.]
Sandy: Eureka!
Prospector: Hey, that's my line!
[Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sandy: Hey, fellas! How'd you like to be part of my cool experiment?
[Patrick breathes green air out of his mouth and his face is charred.]
Patrick: Ooh! I could use a mint! (Rubs his tummy) Mmm!
Sandy: No, Patrick. It's an experiment in behavioral psychology.
Patrick: That doesn't sound tasty.
SpongeBob: What do we have to do?
Sandy: It's easy. I observe you while you two act normal.
SpongeBob: Act normal?
Sandy: Yeah. Just do what you naturally do. [holds out recorder and microphone] Be natural. Starting... now!
[SpongeBob and Patrick stand straight like robots.]
SpongeBob: Uh, natural greeting to you, friend.
Patrick: Natural greeting returned.
[Sandy didn't find that impressive so she did some hand gestures to make SpongeBob and Patrick do something else.]
SpongeBob: Would you like to have some natural fun?
Patrick: Oh, yes. Please.
SpongeBob: Naturally. [laughs nervously and sweats]
Sandy: Aww. Alright. Experiment's done.
[SpongeBob and Patrick move back to their positioned places.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! What are the results?
Patrick: [laughs] Hey, did we do good?
SpongeBob: Oh, can I have an "A" plus?
Patrick: Oh! Oh! Yeah! [squishes SpongeBob] I want an "A" plus too!
[SpongeBob giggles with excitement.]
Patrick: Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty please?
SpongeBob: [makes cute face] Pretty please with sugar on top?
Sandy: Yes, yes. You both get an "A" plus.
SpongeBob: Whoo!
Patrick: I knew it!
[SpongeBob and Patrick hive-five each other.]
Sandy: Subjects acting natural. Resume observation.
SpongeBob: We got an "A" plus!
[Sandy holds out her microphone and SpongeBob and Patrick stopped moving around and went back to standing up straight like robot as they did before. She pulls the microphone back and they both start moving again.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: "A" plus! "A" plus! "A" plus!
Sandy: Oh, forget it.
[The scene changes to Sandy looking at her book while SpongeBob and Patrick dance around inside SpongeBob's house.]
Sandy: When a subject is aware of being observed, it can affect his or her actions and create inaccurate data. Hmm...
[Sandy looks at SpongeBob and Patrick laughing through the window. They both slip inside the house quietly.]
Sandy: Double eureka!
Two Prospectors: That's our line!
[The scene changes to the Sandy inside the house with SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sandy: Hey! Are you guys up for another experiment?
SpongeBob: Oh boy! Am I ever! Can you hook us up to electrodes? Or, or expose us to gamma rays?
Patrick: Yeah?
Sandy: It's a guaranteed "A" plus.
Patrick: Oh! It's like a dream!
Sandy: Okay. First thing. Go to the beach and fill one bucket with white sand and one bucket with black sand. Can you do that?
SpongeBob: Easy sneezy!
[Patrick sneezes on SpongeBob. SpongeBob is covered in saliva and Patrick's brain is sticking out of Patrick's nostril. Patrick sniffs his brain back into his head.]
Sandy: [grossed out] Ew.
Patrick: Hey, yeah. Whatever he said.
Sandy: Then off you go.
[Sandy opens the door and SpongeBob and Patrick leaves the house.]
Sandy: Time to get to work.
[Sandy begins her working process by placing cameras in many parts of SpongeBob's house and hanging microphones on the ceiling. She puts a pair of headsets on Gary.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Sandy!
[Sandy pushes Gary out of sight. SpongeBob and Patrick arrive with two buckets of white and black sand.]
SpongeBob: We're back!
Sandy: Good job, fellers!
Patrick: We're an awesome team!
SpongeBob: We sure are, buddy!
Sandy: Okay, team. For this experiment, I need you to count the grains of sand in each bucket. Then tell me if there are more black grains or more white grains. Or is it the same amount? Alright then. I have to run some errands, but I'll be back later. [walks out]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Aye-aye, Captain Sandy.
Sandy: Oh, and, Patrick, you're in charge.
[Patrick's brain flips and Patrick is speechless. Sandy leaves the house. Outside, an ice cream truck called Pavlovi's Ice Cream was sitting near the house. Inside the truck, Sandy is secretly beginning her experiment with a computer system installed in the truck.]
Sandy: [snickers] All systems check.
SpongeBob: Well, let's get counting. Should we both count white sand and move onto the black sand or do you want to have your own bucket?
[While SpongeBob is talking, Patrick begins to think about what Sandy said before she left.]
Patrick: [thinking] I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.
SpongeBob: So what's it gonna be, boss?
Patrick: Uh, the first one?
SpongeBob: [laughs] You're in charge.
[SpongeBob and Patrick sit on the floor. SpongeBob digs his hand in the bucket.]
Patrick: [thinking] I'm in charge.
SpongeBob: One.
SpongeBob: Ahem.
[Patrick digs his hand in the bucket.]
Patrick: [thinking] I'm in charge.
Patrick: Two.
SpongeBob: Three.
Patrick: [thinking] I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.
[Patrick daydreams of owning his own company called Patrick Corps. and he is in charge as manager. Back in reality, SpongeBob is continuing counting the white sand.]
SpongeBob: Forty-seven. Forty-seven?
[Patrick wakes up from his daydream.]
Patrick: Uh. Huh? What?
SpongeBob: Huh. Lost you there for a bit. We were at forty-seven.
Patrick: [angry] I don't know if I wanna do it this way.
SpongeBob: Okay, boss man. How do you wanna do it?
Patrick: Uh... [thinks]
SpongeBob: How about you count the white and I count the black sand?
Patrick: Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.
[Patrick switches buckets with SpongeBob and counts the grains of white sand.]
Patrick: Forty-eight, forty-... nine, [grabs a grain and looks closely at it] Oh! Oh, fifty!
SpongeBob: [starts counting the black sand] One, two, three, four, five. six,...
Both: Seven, eight, nine, ten.
[They both stop. SpongeBob smiles at Patrick and Patrick groans in frustration. Meanwhile outside, Sandy is preparing ice cream dishes she is about to use as part of her experiment.]
Sandy: Time to initiate the first variable. One big bowl. One small bowl. Exactly eight ounces per bowl. [puts on fake mustache and speaks through microphone] Free ice cream! Free ice cream! One day only! Get your free ice cream!
[SpongeBob and Patrick hears the ice cream truck outside.]
Patrick: Oh boy! Let's go!
SpongeBob: You're the boss!
[Squidward, who is reading a magazine, hears the truck as well.]
Sandy: Free ice cream!
Squidward: Oh my sea stars! Free ice cream!
Sandy: [in Italian accent] Hey, boys! How'd ya like a nice free bowl of tootsie frootsie ice cream?
[SpongeBob and Patrick jump in excitement.]
Sandy: Okey-dokey!
[Sandy gives SpongeBob and Patrick the bowls of ice cream and they head back in the house. Squidward comes up to the truck.]
Squidward: One free ice cream, please?
Sandy: [stunned] All sold out. Maybe I'll get some later.
[Sandy closes the awning on Squidward's nose. Squidward pulls his nose out and walks back to his house, grumbling. Inside SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting on the sofa holding their bowls.]
Patrick: Um. Uh. Your.. your bowl is bigger!
SpongeBob: Do you wanna trade?
Patrick: Yeah.
[SpongeBob and Patrick trade their bowls. Patrick's bowl only has a small amount of ice cream in it. Patrick looks at the bowl and sees SpongeBob has more ice cream in it.]
Patrick: You got more ice cream!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think your ice cream only looks smaller, but the bowl is big.
Patrick: Well, I wanna trade back!
[SpongeBob and Patrick trade their bowls again. But Patrick realizes that he has the small bowl again.]
Patrick: There's only one fair thing to do.
SpongeBob: What's that?
[Patrick grabs SpongeBob's bowl and he eats the ice cream from both big and small bowls.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you call that fair?
[Patrick throws the bowls away.]
Patrick: I'm in charge!
SpongeBob: Uh... Oh. Yeah.
Sandy: Time for variable two. More free ice cream here! Now, with same sized cones!
Squidward: Huh? I just got my slippers on!
Sandy: Here ya go!
[Patrick grabs the cones before SpongeBob.]
Patrick: I'll take those my good man.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, I...
Patrick: I'm in charge.
[Squidward shows up.]
Squidward: One cone, please?
Sandy: All gone!
[Sandy closes the awning on Squidward's hands. Squidward pulls his hands out and walks back to his house, grumbling.]
Squidward: For the love of Pete!
SpongeBob: Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now?
Patrick: Hmmm... [sits on SpongeBob's chair] Rub my feet first!
SpongeBob: Oh, come on!
Patrick: Who's in charge?
SpongeBob: Alright, I'll rub your feet.
[SpongeBob cringes when he sees how hideous Patrick's feet were, but he rubs them anyway. He then notices his cone is melting in Patrick's hand.]
SpongeBob: Hey! My ice cream is melted all over your hand!
Patrick: Oh... I'll fix that.
[Patrick licks SpongeBob's melting ice cream cone.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you are making very poor choices!
Patrick: Don't you back-sass me! I'm in charge and you have to do what I say! Now count that bucket of white sand.
SpongeBob: Alright, I will!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob counting the white sand while his cone is melting in Patrick's hand.]
SpongeBob: One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and one, one-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and two, one-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and three.
[SpongeBob's bucket is completely empty, but his ice cream cone is still melting.]
SpongeBob: Done! Now to count the black sand.
[Patrick selfishly kicks the bucket of black sand.]
Patrick: Oh, that's a pity.
[Patrick steps on the sand and swirls around together.]
Patrick: Looks like you'll have to start over.
SpongeBob: Aaaah! [angry] Enjoying that ice cream, Patrick?
Patrick: Yes, I am.
SpongeBob: Would you like sprinkles on it?
[SpongeBob puts a handful of white sand on Patrick's ice cream cone.]
Patrick: Hey!
[Patrick drops his cone on the sand and arrogantly eats SpongeBob's melted cone. SpongeBob becomes enraged at Patrick's selfish behavior as steam comes out of his holes. However, Sandy discovers what is happening during her experiment.]
Sandy: Jeepers! I didn't see that comin'!
[SpongeBob decides to leave his house but Patrick locks the door.]
Patrick: You're not leaving until I say so!
[SpongeBob and Patrick glare at each and begin circling around as they are ready to fight. Gary watches nervously at the confrontation.]
Sandy: [voiceover] Sandy to Gary! Sandy to Gary! How serious is the situation?
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
Sandy: Oh, I didn't think this all the way through! I've gotta shut this down!
[Sandy activates the emergency button and the siren goes off.]
Squidward: Ah-ha!
[Squidward runs out.]
Squidward: I want my free...
[Sandy opens the door, which sends Squidward flying head first into the sand. Sandy races out of the truck and accidentally steps on Squidward. Squidward pops his head out of the sand.]
Sandy: [pulls on the door] Open the door! The experiment is over! [knocks on it] Open the door!
Patrick: You heard Sandy! Open the door!
SpongeBob: You open it!
Patrick: No, you open it!
SpongeBob: No, you open it!
[Sandy kicks the door open.]
Patrick: Mr. Pavlovi, tell SpongeBob to open the door!
Sandy: [takes off her fake mustache] It's me! Sandy!
[Patrick's anger disappears and his head pops in sudden realization.]
Sandy: The experiment is over!
SpongeBob: But we didn't even finish counting the sand!
Sandy: I didn't care about the sand! I just wanted to observe you acting naturally. So I hid microphones and cameras around your house...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Cameras?
[SpongeBob and Patrick looks around and sees that Sandy was right. There were cameras and microphones hidden around the house. The stood straight like robots as they did at the beginning. SpongeBob then notices Gary wearing a pair of headsets and a camera on his shell, realizing that he was in on Sandy's experiment too.]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Et tu, Gary?
Gary: Meow.
[Patrick, upon realizing that he got carried away with being in charge, breaks down in tears.]
Patrick: I was a monster! I deserve a "Z" minus! [sobs]
SpongeBob: Aww, Patrick. Don't be so hard on yourself. It was the experiment's fault that you were such a jerk.
Patrick: I blame science! Stupid science!
Sandy: Everybody gets an "A" plus and ice cream!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah!
Patrick: [laughs]
[Squidward steps out of the sand and hears laughter in SpongeBob's house. He steps in the house.]
Squidward: What is going on?
[Squidward sees SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Gary incredibly full from eating ice cream.]
Squidward: I know it's a stupid question, but is there any ice cream left?
Sandy: [groans] Sorry. We're all out.
Squidward: [starts a tantrum] You ate it all?! You animals! You didn't even leave me one drop?! [picks up an empty ice cream container and looks in it] There's gotta be some left in here!
[Squidward looks through all the containers and starts crying. Sandy, SpongeBob, Gary, and Patrick leave.]
Sandy: Now let the real experiment begin.
[Sandy pulls the pineapple costume off, revealing that it was a cage in disguise as SpongeBob's house. Squidward continues looking for ice cream in one of the containers.]
Squidward: Come on! Get in my mouth! No, this one's empty!
[The episode ends with Squidward in the cage crying for ice cream while SpongeBob, Sandy, Gary, and Patrick begin studying his behavior patterns.]


[The episode starts with an exterior shot of the Krusty Krab, but the two left maritime flags are messed up, suggesting something is wrong. In addition, the antenna on the roof is bent and the windows in front have huge holes broken in them, with glass shards scattered around the entrance. Then, several fish run out of the restaurant, screaming loudly. We cut to inside, where Mr. Krabs is sitting on the floor, cowering in fear as a sea bear swims up to him, growling and drooling into a puddle on the floor. The camera zooms out slightly, revealing a broken table, barrels scattered everywhere, and the edge of the Galley Grub menu, which has fallen onto the floor. Plankton, in a lion tamer's hat and holding a chair and whip, looks on from on top of the sea bear's back.]
Plankton: Why couldn't I see it before? [the sea bear roars very loudly, blowing Mr. Krabs' face back. Plankton chuckles] The way to get the Krabby Patty formula was so obvious! [he throws the chair and whip away offscreen, and hops down onto the sea bear's head] Spend an inordinate amount of time training several dozen sea bears to take over your restaurant and force you to give it up! [about eight more sea bears surround Mr. Krabs from all sides, all growling] Nothing can turn them from their central purpose!
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Yoo-hoo! [the sea bears all turn to look at SpongeBob] Who wants their tummies tickled? [he has a playful look on his face and is making a tickling motion with his fingers]
Plankton: No... [the sea bears all smile excitedly and dash away, leaving Plankton floating in mid-air] My weapons! [he succumbs to gravity, and falls to the ground so hard he bounces a little] Ouch!
SpongeBob: [standing on top of a green sea bear and tickling his tummy] Sea bears aren't weapons, Plankton. [the sea bear is laughing uncontrollably and waving his front fins around wildly] They're furry buckets of love. [the sea bear starts slapping his tail on the ground, making SpongeBob giggle] See? [jumps off the sea bear's stomach to the other side of the dining room, causing his work hat to fall off] And what do sea bears love more than tummy tickles? [pulls a jellyfish hive out from behind his back and holds it above his head] Jellyfish honey!
[Three sea bears, two green and one brown, see the hive and rush over to SpongeBob. The middle brown one already has on a pink bib with a jellyfish hive on it. SpongeBob pours the honey out of the hive onto his head and tosses the hive away; this makes the sea bears even more excited to the point of drooling. The middle one is rubbing his front fins together in anticipation, and the one on the right has hearts in his eyes and is flapping his fins up and down with his tongue out.]
SpongeBob: [sing-song] Come and get it! [runs out of the Krusty Krab, smothered in honey; all the sea bears swim out after him, breaking through the door, sending wood and glass flying, and knocking down the rest of the maritime flags]
Plankton: [running after his sea bears] No! Come back! [sees Mr. Krabs approaching]
Mr. Krabs: [angry, obviously] Why do you keep doing this, Plankton?
Plankton: [backing away] Heh-heh-heh... [falls down into a sitting position]
Mr. Krabs: [pointing a stern finger at Plankton] When you mess with me business, ya mess with me money! [clenches both claws furiously]
Plankton: [puts on a smile] Er, money's not everything, you know. [laughs nervously]
Mr. Krabs: 'Course it is! [seven dollar bills circle around his eyestalks] Money makes the world go round, and makes me heart go pound. [his heart becomes visible from his shirt, pounding in the shape of a dollar sign]
Plankton: [stands up, putting his hands on his hips] Well, if you love money so much, [mockingly] why don't you marry it?
[Mr. Krabs goes silent, then his mouth opens like a cash register, his lower jaw becoming a drawer divided into compartments, with silver and gold coins in the front one, and dollar bills in the back three; in the back of his throat a white tag with a red dollar sign on it pops up. He pushes his mouth closed.]
Mr. Krabs: [sadly] If I could, I would.
Plankton: [getting an idea] Would you now...? [laughs evilly while rubbing his hands together]
Mr. Krabs: You still here? [lifts Plankton by the antenna and pulls his left leg back]
Plankton: [startled] Yuhh! [Krabs kicks Plankton out of the Krusty Krab all the way across the street to the Chum Bucket] This gives me an idea. [pushes through the double doors of the Chum Bucket, and lands inside. There is a loud crash] Owww!
[Bubble wipe to that night. Mr. Krabs has repaired most of the damage done by the sea bears, except for a gaping hole in the roof, a bite taken out of the left wall, and the front windows, which are still broken. He pushes one of the double doors open, and sighs. He is carrying a garbage bag.]
Mr. Krabs: Ohh... another lonely evening... dumpin' trash... [He walks out of the Krusty Krab, over to two trash cans on the side of the road, one empty, and one overflowing with garbage bags. He lifts the lid of the empty one, drops his bag in, and closes it back.] ...alone. [he hears someone crying] Huh? [he looks around until he sees someone crying on a bench, illuminated by a street light; the "BUS" sign on the street light pole seems to give the implication that this a bus stop next to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs isn't sure what to do at first] Umm... [he decides to go over and see who it is] Hello? Miss?
[To his surprise, it is a stack of dollar bills wearing lipstick and a red bow with yellow polka dots. She stops crying and looks up at him. She's beautiful, and has green eyes with eyelashes, and sparkles a little. Mr. Krabs is instantly attracted to her; he sticks his tongue out and his eyes bloat up, and together they form the shape of a throbbing heart. He makes a weird noise.]
Mr. Krabs: [handing the stack of money a tissue] Ooh, careful now, careful. [smiles] Your ink will run.
[She giggles, and wipes her eyes with the tissue.]
Cashina: My, you're such a gentleman. [sniffles]
Mr. Krabs: Heh. [chuckling nervously while scratching the back of his head] Yeah, well... so, um... what's a nice denomination like youuu [points at her] doin'... on a bench like this?
Cashina: My date was supposed to bring me to the bank... [she starts to cry again] ...but he stood me up! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: [outraged by this] What?? [pointing to himself] Hey, if I met the scallywag that stood you up, I'd knock him down. [he winds up and punches the street light next to him hard, then turns around and smiles proudly; the street light, subsequently, falls off the pole and comes crashing down onto his head] Dooh! [the light cover, which is shaped like a scallop, hinges open, revealing Mr. Krabs' face and making him look like he is wearing a knight's helmet]
Cashina: [as a fanfare plays] My knight in shining exoskeleton!
Mr. Krabs: [quickly sliding onto the bench next to the money, looking at his claw and imitating James Bond] The name's Krabs... Eugene Krabs. [looks at her] And yours?
Cashina: [her cheeks blush a bright pink] Cashina. You're very sweet. [her eyes get all shiny]
Mr. Krabs: You know somethin'? [jumps off the bench and points at Cashina] You look like a million bucks when you smile. [Cashina giggles again; Mr. Krabs gets down onto one knee] Cashina, would you make this old crab's day [looks up and away anxiously] and allow me to take you to a place where you can buy me dinner? [smiles again]
Cashina: I'd love to...
[Cashina's face becomes completely transparent as the rest of her darkens, revealing none other than Plankton inside, sitting on a chair and controlling Cashina by means of a lever, a control panel with buttons, a joystick, and a microphone on it, and a camera]
Plankton: [puts his hand over the microphone] ...scam you out of your secret formula, that is. Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha! [he laughs evilly as Cashina's face reappears; she covers her mouth as Plankton's laugh only comes out as a small giggle.]
[Bubble wipe to the next scene. A green fish wearing a purple shirt walks down the road past Fancy!, a restaurant that looks like a huge ship in a bottle. Inside, elegant music plays as a waiter walks past carrying a covered platter and a bottle of wine with two glasses, along with a napkin. We zoom past some tables with fish seated at them talking, over to where Mr. Krabs and Cashina are laughing and enjoying a plate of spaghetti and meatballs at a table with a checkered tabletop. Judging by all the noodles and meatballs piled inside Cashina, she has already "eaten" quite a lot. As Plankton struggles to pull another noodle in through Cashina's mouth hole, Krabs is slurping on the same noodle at the same time. The noodle gets tighter and tighter as he slurps more and more of it, to the point where Plankton can be seen almost falling out of Cashina's mouth for a second. He just manages to pull himself back in before Mr. Krabs sees him. The noodle bridging Cashina and Mr. Krabs' mouths gets so short, Mr. Krabs has to lean over the table and Cashina has to stand on top of the plate of spaghetti. Becoming desperate, Plankton pulls out a pair or scissors and cuts the noodle, sending both Cashina and Krabs flying in opposite directions.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! Oof! [He lands on his chair, breaking it, and crashes to the floor. Meanwhile, Cashina lands on her back on the edge of the table so hard she starts sparking. Her left side becomes transparent, showing Plankton inside, being electrocuted. Mr. Krabs stands up.] Allow me. [pushes Cashina's legs down until she is sitting upright]
Cashina: This food is so delicious. Oop! You don't suppose it has a secret formula. [she stands up and flicks Mr. Krabs' nose flirtingly] I don't suppose you know anything about secrets... or formulas.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. I do have a very special recipe...
Cashina: Yeeeess...?
Mr. Krabs: [puts his arm around Cashina and slaps the plate off the table] ...for delicious kisses! [the plate can be heard shattering offscreen; inside Cashina, Plankton groans, then suddenly has to put his hand over his mouth to keep from throwing up. Mr. Krabs points to his lips] Cashina, would you mind if I kissed you?
Cashina: [smiles unsurely and turns around, one foot tiptoed] Oh, Eugene. This is all moving so fast...
[inside Cashina]
Plankton: [covers up the microphone again so it won't pick up what he's saying] ...just as I planned. [chuckles]
Cashina: Be gentle! [they both lean in for the kiss; inside Cashina, Plankton presses a gray button on the control panel with a picture of pink lips on it]
Robotic voice: Purse lips.
[Cashina's lips and a rectangular area surrounding them slide upward into Cashina, revealing another pair of lips on a rod which extends outward until Krabs' and Cashina's lips touch. Instantly both of them jump into the air as they jolt all over. After they finish kissing, both of them are charred and smoking.]
Mr. Krabs: [weakly] Wow, what a woman!
[Inside Cashina, Plankton is charred and smoking too. He covers up the microphone again, and some slight feedback is heard.]
Plankton: Ugh. Well, I finally did it— I kissed a crab!
[Bubble wipe to Mr. Krabs' anchor at night. The camera zooms in on his bedroom window. Cut to Mr. Krabs lying on his stomach on his hammock, giggling. He is holding and looking at a golden heart-shaped locket, but only the back of it can be seen at first. Krabs sighs dreamily and rolls over onto his back, then resumes giggling. We cut to a shot of the front of the locket, and finally get to see what he is looking at: the locket contains a picture of Cashina with one hand on her hip and the other fluffing her "hair," on a magenta background with red hearts surrounding her.]
Mr. Krabs: [now sitting up] Oh, Cashina... [he kisses Cashina's picture... right as his daughter Pearl opens the door and steps into the room]
Pearl: [cheerfully] Daddy, I want to... [The background music stops with a record scratch. Mr. Krabs gasps and stops kissing the locket, but it's too late. He shifts his gaze to behind him and sees Pearl's smile fade and her eyes open wide.] EEWWWW! [her face turns from shock to disgust and she points an accusing finger at her father] Are you kissing a locket with a woman's picture in it?!
[Krabs starts to sweat profusely.]
Mr. Krabs: [nervously shaking his head] Oh, no, no! [glances away to the right] I was, uh... [he holds up the locket, making sure Pearl only sees the back of it, and points to it] I was polishin'... this jewelry... with me... mouth hole... you see. [he sticks his tongue out as he speaks and points to his mouth, which now has red lips] Like this! [he closes his eyes, growing eyelashes, and kisses the locket several times] Right, hmm... [He puts the locket's chain around his neck, tucking the locket itself under his shirt to hide it from Pearl. He finishes by smiling goofily.]
Pearl: [screaming in Mr. Krabs' face, causing him to recoil somewhat] Gross! [storms angrily out of the room; her father gets down from the hammock and follows her]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, me little beluga... [Pearl stops, turns around, and puts her flippers on her hips; Krabs scratches the back of his head again] I never thought I'd say this, but... [raises a claw and smiles] I may have found you a new mom.
Pearl: [shakes her head] No way! [starts pacing counterclockwise around Mr. Krabs with her flippers out] I have seen stepmoms in movies, Dad. She'll make me sweep up the cinders, and then she won't let me go to the ball! [she stops pacing] And then I'll never meet my Prince Charming! [she starts bawling, and tears start spraying from her eyes like little waterfalls and flood the room]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls a string, which unplugs a cork stopper, thereby draining the ocean of tears Pearl cried and leaving behind a few puddles] Ya know, we're gonna have to have another talk about fantasy and reality.
Pearl: [who has stopped crying by now, but is still worried] Okay... then what's she like?
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] Well, she's... [A cash register ding is heard, and Mr. Krabs grins and his eyes get huge and shiny. He is surrounded by twinkling stars and dollar signs] ...everything I've ever wanted in a woman.
Pearl: [offscreen] Blech!
Mr. Krabs: [sees Pearl crossing her arms and snaps out of it] Oh, don't worry, sweetie. Nothing will ever come between us. [He scuttles over and starts petting her on the nose. Pearl smiles. Just then, the doorbell rings, and Mr. Krabs gasps excitedly.] She's here! Out of me way! [Pearl does not get out of the way in time, and her dad rushes past her so quickly that she spins around rapidly before slowing to a stop and flopping down on her back. Mr. Krabs gets to the front door and opens it for Cashina.] Hello, me little money stack. [he walks her over to the table where Pearl is already sitting in a blue metal chair, looking rather upset] I want you to meet me daughter, Pearl. [he sits in a plain chair, while Cashina hops up onto a barrel topped with a round red throw cushion]
Cashina: [awkwardly] Pearl, I... love your rouge. [points at it] How chic!
Pearl: [not amused] It's actually a rash. [she has a rash that looks like rouge on the left side and continuing about a third of the way across the front side of her nose]
Plankton: [inside Cashina, starting to sweatdrop] Uhhhh... Teen Talk, Teen Talk... [he picks up a purple magazine with the red words "TEEN TALK" on a yellow background on the front cover, and fries through the pages] Ah. Girls like shoes.
[while Plankton has been consulting his Teen Talk magazine, Cashina's face has become frozen in a weird expression, but it pops back to normal.]
Cashina: [pointing at Pearl's boots] Well, Pearl, I love your shoes.
Pearl: [getting mad, crossing her arms] I'm not wearing shoes. Those are barnacles. [a quick shot of Pearl's feet reveal that Pearl is indeed not wearing her white boots right now; she does, however, have white barnacles covering her back fins that look like boots from a distance]
Cashina: Oh, uh... heh... [raises her finger] I have some cream for that.
Pearl: [explodes] Stop trying to mom at me, lady! [She bangs on the table with both fists so hard that Cashina and Mr. Krabs both bounce in their seats. Pearl looks away and crosses her arms.] I don't need youuu!
Cashina: [becoming a little concerned] Well, Pearl, since I'm seeing your father, I hope we can learn to understand each other.
Pearl: [points at Cashina] You'll never understand me! [gets up so fast she knocks her chair over] In fact, I'm going to make it a point to never be understandable again! [she walks over to the bathroom doorway, but turns back and points at Cashina again] Blarb snobble goober blaaab!
[On the word "blab," she stomps her foot as hard as she can, causing the screen to shake briefly, and runs into the bathroom. Mr. Krabs sighs as Cashina jumps up onto the table.]
Mr. Krabs: Let me talk to her.
Cashina: [holds her hand out as if she's saying "stop"] No. I think I should do this alone.
[she ruffles her "hair"; bubble wipe to Krabs pacing back and forth in the living room]
Mr. Krabs: [groaning] Oh... I haven't been this nervous since me first boatswain's ball. [he is startled when he sees Pearl and Cashina descending the stairs into the living room]
Cashina: [telling Pearl a story] ...and I was all, "You call this a mugging?" And then I suplexed him until he gave me my purse back! [they both hug each other and laugh hysterically]
Mr. Krabs: [walking over to them with his claws on his hips] Hey-hey, you two! How about inviting me into your inside joke? Eh?
Pearl: Oh, you wouldn't get it, Dad. It's a "giiirl thing."
Mr. Krabs: [walks closer to Cashina and gets onto one knee again while bowing, surprising Cashina] Cashina, you know I love ya. [looks up at Pearl] And now me daughter loves ya too. Will you marry me, Cashina?
[Cashina studies Mr. Krabs' face. He is biting his lip and looks almost desperate, almost pleading. Pearl smiles really big excitedly, hoping Cashina will say "yes." Cut to inside Cashina.]
Plankton: [clenching his teeth, also excited] Eeeeeeee...
[Back to Mr. Krabs' face.]
Cashina: [holding her arms out] Yes! Yes! Yes!
[Pearl clasps her fins to the sides of her face. Three hot-pink hearts with dollar bills inside them appear floating above Mr. Krabs. Cut to inside Cashina]
Plankton: Perfect! [lifts his finger up high in the air] When we're married, he'll have to tell me the secret formula! [laughs evilly, then fist-pumps] Yeah!
[Bubble wipe to the Krusty Krab sometime later, possibly even the next day. The exterior of the building has already been decorated for the wedding. A red carpet leads to the entrance, which is surrounded by colorful lights that have been strung all the way around the Krusty Krab and even around the pole of the sign, which has a silver diamond ring sitting in the bottom part of the clamshell. The maritime flags hanging above the door and windows have been replaced by a white banner with small red hearts painted all over it; the banner is supported in the center by two big hearts— the bigger one is red, and the smaller one which is in front of the bigger one is closer to pinkish-red. Last but not least, some red, pink, and light blue balloons are tied to the chimney. A few boatmobiles are already parked out front, including a white limousine with yellow porthole Windows and a yellow spoiler, which is presumably for Mr. Krabs and Cashina. The whole scene zooms in slightly.]
Mr. Krabs: [from inside] SpongeBob! You're gonna be me wedding planner.
[cut to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob inside the former's office]
SpongeBob: [removes his work hat, puts his legs together, and bows] I'm so honored, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Great! [holds up a dollar as a cash register dings] Here's your budget.
[he hands the dollar to SpongeBob, who takes it]
SpongeBob: [stretches the dollar with both hands, then lets it go, causing it to make a snapping sound, and holds it up high] Mr. Krabs, I am gonna stretch this dollar until it begs for mercy! [he sees Mr. Krabs walk up to him looking rather offended, and starts playing with the dollar nervously] No... disrespect for your new bride.
[Cut to five onions, four heads of lettuce, six tomatoes, six Krabby Patty patties, and three different kinds of cheese sitting on a table that has been decorated with a white tablecloth. SpongeBob chops all of this up with his spatula, turning it into an amazing centerpiece with blue ribbon sticking out of it and a golden trident in the center. In a wider shot, we can see that SpongeBob has already decorated a few tables the same way. As Squidward, wearing a top hat with a red band and a wedding tuxedo with a red bowtie, puts a white tablecloth over a bare table, SpongeBob, in an outfit similar to Squidward's, tops the centerpiece with a whole tomato, then stands back and admires his work with a big smile on his face. Pink ribbon can be seen strung around a pole along with green confetti, with more pink ribbon hanging from the ceiling. A white banner with small red hearts on it, similar to the one outside, is also hung from the ceiling. After a second, SpongeBob runs away laughing. Just then, Patrick appears, dressed in a top hat with a purple band and a black bowtie, along with his shorts. He is also wearing white cuffs. He is carrying a plate stacked with plates and glasses, but is also rolling backwards on a wooden barrel. Squidward does not care and continues with his tablecloth.]
Patrick: [struggling to stay on the barrel] Huh, hee, whooah-oh-hoo-hoo...!
[SpongeBob flings a few plain patties onto a banner and the words "Krabs + Cashina" are spelled on screen. SpongeBob splats some ketchup in a cup. Then he takes that same cup and then gets a cup of mustard in his other hand.]
SpongeBob: Would you like our house red or or house yellow? [laughs]
[Afer they finish making the wedding decorations, the scene fades to the wedding going on.]
Wedding Manager: And now, the couple will exchange their vow.
Cashina: Eugene, you have everything I've ever wanted with a man: An exoskeleton, freakishly long eyestalks, and the secret krabby patty formula.
Audience: Aww...
Mr. Krabs: Cashina, you gave it to my life, but I thought I'd leave the rest of it alone. You showed me once and for all: If money can't buy you love, it can give you love.
Audience: Aww...
Wedding Manager:  You may now kiss the bride. [They kiss each other and get electrocuted again. The audience goes wild]
Cashina: Oh no, what about the bouquet?
SpongeBob: Uh... One bouquet coming up, Mrs. Krabs [He steals some flowers from the crowd and makes a bouquet and Cashina throws it to Patrick, causing him to eat it.]
Patrick:  [laughs with his mouth full] Hooray! I win! [he belches loudly]
[All the women start bawling, while a bloated Mrs. Puff just sits there sadly. Scene bubble transitions to Mr. Krabs dancing with Cashina.]
SpongeBob: [As Patrick picks his teeth with a toothpick] It's a shame Plankton couldn't be here.
Plankton: [inside Cashina] Ugh... Uhh... Uhh! Who knew Eugene was so light on his crab legs? [He vomits. Bubble transitions to Honeymoon Hotel, Mr. Krabs and Cashina's car pull up and they enter the hotel, into a room. Mr. Krabs takes off his tie and goes over to Cashina, who is on top of two pillows]
Cashina: Eugene, I don't want there to be any secrets between us.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what? Oh, I'll tell you everything. No matter how embarrassed, I wet the bed until I was 40. My armpits smell like tartar sauce when I'm afraid.
Cashina: Not those kinds of secrets.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, OK. Whatever you want, me sweet. Just ask.
Cashina: I want you to tell me... (scheming smile face) the secret Krabby Patty formula!
Mr. Krabs: The what?
Cashina: The secret formula... is locked away in your heart. Unlock your heart for me, Eugene. Let me in
Mr. Krabs: Oh, anything for you, baby. (He looks in both directions, Left and Right) I'm gonna whisper it to you, just in case there's any prying ears out there.
Plankton: Oh boy, here it comes!
Mr. Krabs: Alright, me sweet. Here it is. (He starts to get emotional) Ugh. I'm gettin' a little emotional. While, I never told anyone the secret... Krabby Patty formula before. [Cashina grins in anticipation] So, here goes. [he takes a deep breath, about to tell her the formula, but then grimaces as a tear falls from his eye] Erngh. [His tear falls into Cashina's mouth, causing her to explode and reveal Plankton inside a robot.]
Plankton: (Girl voice) Come on, Krabs [The voice starts to fade away into his normal voice] Let it all out! [Realizes Mr. Krabs sees him]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton?!
Plankton: No, no, I'm not Plankton [Tries to cover himself with a part of the robot. Imitating Cashina] I'm Cashina, you're blushing bride. I.. uh... uh... Am I blushing?
Mr. Krabs: You... monster! [He is about to crush Plankton but stops and groans loudly]
Plankton: You're not gonna crush me?
Mr. Krabs: I've been alone for so long, and for the first time in forever, I felt for someone. Well, I mean something: A pile of cash with lips. It was all too good to be true. Cashina may have not been real, but me feelings were, weren't they?
Plankton: Get a hold of yourself, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, are you saying it was all just a scheme to you? And you felt nothing?
Plankton: You're crazy! I'm out of here, and one day, the formula will be mine! Mark it. [He exits. Mr. Krabs scoops up some of the remains of Cashina in each of his claws and holds them close to his face, trying not to cry. He cries anyway. A doorman enters the room.]
Doorman: Oh, hey buddy. I want you to know: although your wife just ran out on you, you still have to tip me.[He puts all the cash into his suit, grabs a nickel and throws it. He catches it with his soup and makes a dazed face at it. The episode ends.]


[the episode starts in Pearl's room]
Pearl: Ooh! [kissing a magazine] Mwah, mwah, mwah! Aaahhh!!! Num-num-num-mmm... Mwah! [calling Marina]
Marina: [cell phone rings and she picks up] Hi, Pearl.
Pearl: Hey, girl! Let's hang out!
Marina: Uh, I can't, I have to work at Hot-Dog on a String today. Brad called in sick, so I'm in charge of stringing the dogs. Totally lame.
Pearl: I guess I'll see you later then.
Boy Customer: Uh... Can I get one with extra string?
Marina: Ugh.
Nocturna: [phone rings] What?
Pearl: [calling Nocturna] Hey, girl! Want to come over and make fun of boys or something?
Nocturna: Uh, sorry, girl, I can't. I'm working at Scorched Coral all day. It's heinous.
Pearl: [laughs] Oh! So heinous. See ya later.
Nocturna: See ya later, Pearl.
Girl Customer: How much is this choker?
Nocturna: Um, it's a wrist band.
Girl Customer: [gasping and choking]
Nocturna: Awesome.
Nixie: [cell phone rings] Nixie speaking.
Pearl: [calling Nixie] Nixie! My bestest friend in the whole wide world. You should come over. We can watch TV and eat cheese!
Nixie: I wish I could, Pearl, but I have to work at Dangles and Bangles. All dangles are half off with the purchase of any bangle. Dangle must be of equal or lesser value than bangle. Some restrictions may apply.
Pearl: Oh, you don't work at the mall, do you, Derek?
Derek: No, but all my girlfriends do. [ding]
Pearl: Daddy! Guess what?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps, swallows his wallet, chuckles] I have no idea, Pearly.
Pearl: Dad, I'm getting a job today.
Mr. Krabs: [shouts] Yahoo! Oh, this is great news, Pearl, me dear!
Mr. Krabs: Now instead of wasting my precious money on your "clothes" and your "school supplies"... [chuckles] You can waste your own.
Pearl: I'll be an independent working woman, blazing my own trail and standing on my own two fins.
Mr. Krabs: That's the spirit.
Pearl: Oh, can I borrow $10?
Mr. Krabs: I'll miss you around the house.
Pearl: Oh, Daddy, you'll see me after work.
Mr. Krabs: I was talkin' to the money.
Pearl: [at the mall]Hey, Marina! I'm here to apply for a job.
Marina: You should meet the manager, I guess. He's in his office. Mr. Pepalino, there's someone here for a job.
Pearl: Ah!
Marina: [straining, grunting, groaning]
Pearl: I-I don't think he's in there.
Mr. Pepalino: [muffled moaning, mumbling, groaning, gargling] We're not hiring.
Nocturna: Welcome to Scorched Coral. Please go away. Oh, hey, Pearl. What are you doing here?
Pearl: I would like to apply for a job, please.
Nocturna: Yeah, sorry. You're a little late. We were hiring, but we actually just hired someone today.
Pearl: Ah! Oh, Nixie, I need to work at Dangles and Bangles! This is my last chance, you gotta help me out here! Oh, please, please, please, please, please!
Nixie: Come on, let me introduce you to the manager. This is--
Bangles and Dangles manager: Nope, not hiring.
Pearl: You don't understand. I have to work here!
Bangles and Dangles manager: Sorry, missy, the only thing we don't dangle here... is hope.
Pearl: Oh, bangles. Ah... [belches] Oh, this is the worst. If I don't get a job at the mall, I'm gonna have to hang out with my dad! [sighs]
Beatrice: You looking for a job, deary?
Pearl: Yeah! I need one as soon as possible. It's a life or death situation, actually.
Beatrice: Oh, my goodness. Are you in danger?
Pearl: In danger of never seeing my friends 'cause I don't have a job.
Beatrice: Come with me.
Pearl: [gasps as she follows] Weird. I've never been in this part of the mall before. [gasps] Ugh! What's that smell?
Beatrice: Oh, probably one of the many perfumes that we sell here at Grandma's Apron! Congratulations! You're hired.
Pearl: [gasps] Oh, this is the best day of my life!
Beatrice: [groaning] Ah! [back pops] Well, I can't quite afford to be picky these days. The only other employee besides me was Myrtle, and she's... no longer with us.
Both: [shrieks]
Myrtle: Almost forget my shades! See ya later, suckers! [laughing]
Marina: Hey, Pearl. Over here.
Nocturna: Did you find a job?
Pearl: Yeah, I got a job at Grandma's Apron.
Marina: [laughing] Pearl, you cannot be serious.
Nocturna: Ew, that store is for old people.
Nixie: [laughing] Old people are so... old.
Pearl: Old people aren't that bad. Are they?
All: [laughter]
Marina: Hey, girls. I smell moth balls.
Pearl: Well, we are having a sale on them. They're 25% off today.
Nocturna: Um, isn't it your nap time, Pearl?
Nixie: Where's your muumuu, granny?
All: [laughter]
Beatrice: Oh, don't let those bubble-headed nincompoops get to you, Pearly.
Pearl: But it's not fair.
Beatrice: Life's not fair, my dear. We all go through hard times at some point. Here, look. See? I was different from the other girls, and they teased me for it. They called me "Boring Beatrice." Not very creative, those girls. [chuckles while showing a picture]
Pearl: Who would even take a picture of that?
Beatrice: Oh, good ol' Jonesy from the AV Club took that one!
Pearl: Wait, but who took that picture--
Beatrice: All that matters, Pearly, my dear, is that things will soon change. But in the meantime, you should be having as much fun as possible. Let me show you how grandmas do it.
Both: [laughter]
Pearl: Whoa, come back here, yarn! [panting]
All: [gasp, when Pearl walks over]
Marina: [laughing] Love the shoes, Pearl.
Pearl: You guys just don't get it. Being a grandma is fun. I get to sit in a rocking chair, dust tchotchkes, bake cookies, knit mittens, hats, and scarves.
All: [laughter]
Nocturna: Scarves.
Pearl: It's actually, like, the most coral store in the whole mall, so you can all just... just... eat barnacles!
All: [laughter]
Beatrice: Now, now, girls. Let's be polite.
Marina: What are you gonna do about it, granny? [grunting menacingly]
Beatrice: Granny power! Power! Power! [echoing]
Marina: [screams]
All: [screaming]
Beatrice: Pearl, toss me the Autumn Years perfume.
Pearl: Hi-ya!
All: [screaming]
Marina: It smells like pills and bed pans. Whoa!
Beatrice: [laughing]
All: [whimpering]
Beatrice: Well, now that you're all sitting down, let me tell you about the first time I ever saw a talking picture show. Oh, boy, did they know how to talk.
Nixie: No, please! I can't take anymore!
Marina: It's... so... boring!
Nocturna: No, I hate the past!
Narrator: One hour later...
Beatrice: And that's why today, we all wear shoes.
Marina: Okay, okay, we get it, we will stop being mean, I promise, just let us go!
All: Whoa! [groaning]
Marina: Listen, Pearl. We didn't mean to hurt your feelings or anything. We just, like, think it's weird that you're, like, a grandma now, or whatever. We don't really get it.
Pearl: Well, I don't care what you think anymore anyway. I'm being true to myself, and--and that's all that matters!
All: Eh.
Pearl: I'm a grandma now. Right, Beatrice?
Beatrice: Oh, Pearl, I'm so glad you enjoy being a grandma, but your friends make a good point. You're only young once, you see. You don't want to grow up too fast or you'll miss out on all the fun.
Pearl: I guess you're right. Being a grandma is nice and all, but I do miss being a super hip young person.
Beatrice: Go have yourself some fun, my dear. Ah, ah, ah, ah. How 'about a nice, gentle handshake instead? [groans]
Pearl: Hey, wait up, guys! I want to be friends while I'm still young!
Beatrice: I'll see you tomorrow.
SpongeBob: [appears] You dropped this.


[The episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick about to thumb wrestle.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: One, two, three, four...
Patrick: I declare a thumb war! [they both thumb wrestle]
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: Yah!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughter]
Patrick: Now that was a great thumb war, mister!
SpongeBob: It was Patrick, but now we will let peace prevail. Let us sign this treaty, and our thumbs will live in harmony.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they sign the treaty with their thumbs] [start laughing]
SpongeBob: Great job, Patrick! [SpongeBob gives Patrick two thumbs-up, one from each hand]
Patrick: Gee, thanks, SpongeBob. That means a lot!
SpongeBob: Wow, giving someone a thumbs-up feels great!
[cut to the Krusty Krab]
Customer: Boy, these Krabby Patties are delicious.
Other customer: I'll say. They're absolutely stupendous.
SpongeBob: Well, you guys are stupendous customers. [SpongeBob gives the customer two thumbs-up.]
Customer: [gasps] That thumbs-up really touched my heart.
Other customer: Yeah, me too. It's like there's a thumbprint of happiness on my aorta. [heart thumps]
SpongeBob: Flipping.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you shifty sea-slacker, have you counted the cups like I told to do?
SpongeBob: I sure have, Mr. Krabs. Five. But thanks for being on top of the situation. You're a fantastic boss. [SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs one thumbs-up.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, thank you. That's nice of you to say. Now back to work!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs one thumbs-up.]
SpongeBob: ... [SpongeBob gives Old lady one thumbs-up]
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, do you have one of your precious thumbs-up for me? I would just love to get one. [snickers]
SpongeBob: No, Squidward, I do not have a thumbs-up for you.
SpongeBob: I've got two thumbs-up! [SpongeBob gives Squidward two thumbs-up.]
Squidward: Oh. That's... thank you. I think.
SpongeBob: [whistling] Whoo!
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, I'm giving your outfit two thumbs-up. [SpongeBob gives Sandy two thumbs-up.]
Sandy: [giggles] This old thing? It's just something I threw on.
SpongeBob: Well, girl, you really make it work. [SpongeBob gives Sandy one thumbs-up.]
Sandy: Okay.
Driver: Excuse me, I'm trying to find the Goo Lagoon and I'm totally lost.
SpongeBob: Great job on not being afraid to ask for directions. [SpongeBob gives Driver two thumbs-up.]
Driver: Hm... that way? Okay.
SpongeBob: You got the right stuff, golden boys. [SpongeBob kisses his two thumbs-up.]
Sandy: SpongeBob, don't you think that you may be using the thumbs-up just a teensy bit too much?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? [SpongeBob put his one thumbs-up on Sandy's helmet.]
SpongeBob: The thumbs-up is an iconic, internationally-recognized sign of positivity and affirmation. Boop!
Sandy: Yeah, I know. But when you do it all the time the thumbs-up loses its meaning. It becomes not special.
SpongeBob: Well, I happen to think you can never give too many thumbs-up. [SpongeBob put his many thumbs-up.]
Sandy: I don't know, SpongeBob. I think you should be careful.
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy, don't be such a worry whale.
SpongeBob: What could do wrong? [SpongeBob put his two thumbs-up.] [humming]
SpongeBob: Ah. [SpongeBob blows his two thumbs-up] Whoo, I'm giving away thumbs-up today.
SpongeBob: Hey, guy. Way to wait. [SpongeBob gives Fish Guy two thumbs-up.]
Fish Guy&#160;: Who, me?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob put his left thumbs-up on his mouth makes gives Fish Guy big one right thumbs-up.]
Fish Guy: Yeah... [whistling]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gives Fish Guy one thumbs-up]
SpongeBob: Hey, guy. Way to walk. [SpongeBob gives Fish Guy two thumbs-up.]
Fish Guy: [whimpers] [thud]
SpongeBob: Oh, this feels great.
SpongeBob: Way to flick that eye booger-- [SpongeBob gives Other Fish Guy two thumbs-up.] [His thumbs snap, then a live-action footage of trains crashing shows, with a new live action footage every time his thumbs snap, followed by a bridge falling apart, a tree falling, a crow, and a baby crying. Eventually, SpongeBob breaks his thumbs]
Thumbhawk two: Thumbhawk one. Thumbhawk one. This is Thumbhawk two. We got two thumbs down. Repeat. Two thumbs down!
Thumbhawk one: Thumbhawk one here, copy that. Initiate emergency procedures.
Thumbhawk two: Initiating on my count. Three, two, one.
Thumbhawk one and two: [Screaming]
SpongeBob: My thumbs. My thumbs! My thumbs!
SpongeBob: How's it looking, Dr. Manfish?
Dr. Manfish: Well, I'm afraid it doesn't look good, SpongeBob. It seems you've severely damaged your ulnar collateral ligament, possible from some kind of repeated action.
SpongeBob: An action like a thumbs-up?
Dr. Manfish: Certainly that is one possibility. Hitchhiking could be another.
SpongeBob: But doctor, I will be able to use my thumbs again, right?
Dr. Manfish: [Dr. Manfish takes both his eye lenses off.] SpongeBob, I can't say that for certain. I'm only a board certified thumbologist. I don't know everything. I can only say that we must give it time and see. There are limits to science. But you should prepare yourself for the possibility that you may never regain the use of your thumbs again. [Dr. Manfish put his right eye lenses on.]

[Thumb coughs]

Mr. Krabs: All right, you boneless invertebrate lazy bones... [chuckles] Come on. Flip them patties, boy-o, just like the old days.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Uh, let me give you a hand. My thumbs work.
SpongeBob: No! I can do it. [groans]
Mr. Krabs: I'm sorry, son, but I have a business to run. I'm gonna have to let you go.
SpongeBob: That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I understand.
Mr. Krabs: Now where's me new fry cook?
Mr. Krabs: There he is. Come on in here.
Patrick: Uh, sorry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm glad it's you. Better than some weird stranger, right?
Patrick: Uh, yeah, I guess. I probably won't even be able to do good flipping.
SpongeBob: With a little practice, you could do anything. [SpongeBob holds both his broken thumbs-up] [groan] Oh...
All: [gasp]
SpongeBob: OI' Patty flippin' patties. Who'd a' thunk it, huh?
Customer: Poor kid.
[cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street] ♪Thumbs are opposable, thumbs are great. We share 'em with the monkeys and with the apes. You can grab, you can tie, you can pinch a cheek. But without your thumbs you're all thumbs. All thumbs, no thumbs, busted up your thumbs. Sucking on your pinky will sure look dumb. You can never hitch a ride or pull out a plum. Without your thumbs you're all thumbs. All thumbs, no thumbs, fells like a crime. Can't pull up a zipper or flip a dime. And forget about chopsticks you'll starve every time. Without your thumbs you're all thumbs. Thumbs, Thumbs, Thumbs, Thumbs, Thumbs, Thumbs, Thumbs, Thumbs. Without your thumbs you're all thumbs.♪
Sandy: [cuts to inside SpongeBob's pineapple] SpongeBob! It's me, Sandy! [opens the door] Hey SpongeBob! I haven't seen you in days, whatcha doin'?
SpongeBob: Waiting for autumn.
Sandy: Come now, it can't be that bad!
SpongeBob: Leave me Sandra, forget you ever knew me! Erase from your memory the face of this useless sponge! With these...[shows his thumbs which appear to be nailed in to a piece of wood]...mutilated thumbs!
Sandy: [gasps] Don't give up SpongeBob! You have to find something you love! Something to live for! 
SpongeBob: And what might that be?
Sandy: [shakes her head] I don't know SpongeBob! That's a question you have to answer for yourself. [leaves SpongeBob's pineapple]
SpongeBob: Sandy? Sandy! Sandy come back! [gets out a jar of peanut butter] I need you to help me open this jar of peanut butter! [tries to open the jar, fails, and starts crying] Enough sitting around feeling sorry for myself! [Cut to the Hospital, where SpongeBob tries to tear off the bandages on one of his thumbs, and succeeds. Then he lifts a barbell with the other one. He then tries to use the controller while playing a game, which was actually a heart monitor for a patient, who moves in weird positions. SpongeBob brings up his thumbs, and he nods] [cut to the Krusty Krab kitchen, where Patrick is cooking Krabby Patties]
Patrick: Uhhhhhh, turn over. [SpongeBob enters the kitchen]
SpongeBob: My thumbs are better and I am ready to work!
Patrick: The job's taken.
SpongeBob: Well I'm taking it back.
Patrick: Just how are you gonna do that?
SpongeBob: [tears up treaty] Thumb war.
Patrick: [holds up his thumb] En garde!
SpongeBob and Patrick: One, two, three, four. I declare a thumb war! [SpongeBob and Patrick play thumb war and do it while walking in the restaurant. Eventually, once they walk on a ledge, they lose their balance and SpongeBob is hanging on Patrick's hand. Then a piece of the ledge breaks off due to Patrick's weight.]
Patrick: Admit it! You have been bested!
SpongeBob: Never! [they land on a customer's table, and Patrick eats the Krabby Patty]
Patrick: Then prepare to be pinned!
Sandy: Don't give up! Something to live for! [gives SpongeBob the thumbs-up]
Customers: Something to live for! [they all give SpongeBob the thumbs-up]
Customers: Woooaaahh! [SpongeBob pins Patrick and wins the thumb war!]
SpongeBob: Yeeeaaahh!
Sandy: SpongeBob wins! [she and the crowd cheer]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you old patty junkie! Welcome home son! [SpongeBob glances at Patrick]
Patrick: It's okay, I hate work anyway. [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh Patrick!
Patrick: No really, I do hate work! [everyone laughs even harder, even Patrick starts laughing] Everybody's laughing! Oh hey SpongeBob, I got something for ya!
SpongeBob: Yes Patrick?
[Patrick gives SpongeBob two thumbs-ups, as well as SpongeBob. The crowd cheers, SpongeBob's and Patrick's thumbs launch into the air, and explode into a big "THE END" and the episode ends]


[The scene shows the Chum Bucket. Inside SpongeBob, Plankton, and Karen are in line doing the conga and laughing in a party-looking setting.]
Plankton: More fruit punch, SpongeBob?
[Karen gets SpongeBob a glass of fruit punch.]
SpongeBob: You know, Plankton, when you invited me over, I thought it was another trick to get the Krabby Patty formula. Now, I see you just love social gatherings in the workplace!
[SpongeBob drinks the fruit punch.]
Plankton: Oh, I love office parties. We got roller chair races and karaoke. Hey! I know a gag we can do. Copy our faces on the new copy machine!
[SpongeBob looks at the copier.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! Should I put my face on the glass?
Plankton: Why don't you lay your whole body down? That glass is big enough.
SpongeBob: How's this? Like this? What about this? Is this good?
Plankton: Just lay face-down and keep still. [clicks "SCAN"]
SpongeBob: [Laughs]
Plankton: Alright. Party's over. Go home!
SpongeBob: Aw...But I'd like some more fruit punch.
Plankton: No more punch for you! You don't look so good, SpongeBob. I suggest you take the day off tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Nah! I feel fine!
Plankton: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: Now that you ask, I don't know. [feels a twinge] I think I just felt a twinge!
Plankton: You'll be fine if you take tomorrow off. [Slams the door. The scene returns to the copier. Plankton clicks "PRINT." A copy of SpongeBob is printed from the copier. Plankton squirts a drop of toner. The SpongeBob copy comes to life.] Hello, SpongeBob CopyPants. Can you say "Secret formula"?
SpongeBob Copy: Se.. Se... for mama.
Plankton: "Se-cret Form-ula".
SpongeBob Copy:  Se-cret Form-ula. Secret formula!
[The SpongeBob copy and Plankton both laugh evilly. Scene cuts to Plankton making a tie for CopyBob]
Plankton: Now, remember. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and your assignment is to ask Krabs for the secret Krabby Patty formula.
SpongeBob Copy: My name is SpongeBob SquarePants, and I want the secret formula.
Plankton: Excellent! Now, off you go! Wait! [He colors the white tie with a blue marker.] Just keeping track of my copy.
[The copy walks into the Krusty Krab humming. The real SpongeBob is humming the same tune, but gets stopped by Plankton.]
Plankton: What are you doing here?! You said you would take today off.
SpongeBob: But I feel great today.
Plankton: Are you sure? Because you're sweating. [Scene shows SpongeBob in a pot of fire. SpongeBob walks away but Plankton bursts over.]
Plankton: But you can't work. You have yellow jaundice!
SpongeBob: [Laughs] Oh, Plankton. Yellow is my natural color. [Goes into Krusty Krab. Scene shows the copy putting on a Krusty Krab hat.]
SpongeBob Copy: Morning.
Squidward: Whatever. [The real SpongeBob comes doing the same thing]
SpongeBob: Morning.
Squidward: I said "Whatever." [Shocked] Wait, didn't I just... didn't I...[Looks behind the window as there is two SpongeBobs.]
Both SpongeBobs: Ooh. [Both laugh]
Squidward: There's only one explanation. I'm still in my bed and I'm having a nightmare! [Starts beating himself up.] Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! [A short customer enters]
Short customer: I'd like to place an order for two.
Squidward: Two, as in Two SpongeBobs? Sure, this is all just a bad dream, right? I'm dreaming and you're in my dream!
Short customer: That's me: The man of your dreams. [Walks away]
Squidward: If this is a dream. there are no consequences. I can do anything! [He pushes a cup of soda off the cash register but it's floating in the air.] I really am dreaming! [Scene shows a kid with a propeller hat making the cup fly. Scene cuts to the SpongeBobs.]
SpongeBob: What's your name, handsome stranger?
SpongeBob Copy: My name is SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: [Surprised] Wow! We look alike and have the same name! That's two things we have in common! [Both laugh] I always wanted a twin brother! [Turns into a bubble shape of himself] How do you feel about bubbles?
SpongeBob Copy: I love them! [The real SpongeBob turns into a jellyfish]
SpongeBob: Jelly fishing?
SpongeBob Copy: The same thing you do. [The real SpongeBob turns his face into the form of Squidward's face.]
SpongeBob: How about Squidward?
SpongeBob Copy: Oh, please. [Both laugh]
SpongeBob: I think I'll nickname you... Me two! [Both laugh again. Plankton goes into SpongeBob Copy's ear.]
Plankton: Hey, SpongeCopy. Good to see ya. [Whispers] Have you learned the secret formula yet?
Me Two: Oh, I can't tell you that. It's a secret. By the way, my name is Me Two.
Plankton: Me Two? I'm such a deep sea dope! Now that the copy's gone in contact with the original SpongeBob, he won't tell me the formula. [Me Two launches Plankton into Mr. Krabs' office.] Time to adjust my plan. [Mr. Krabs appears.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute! I can't afford two SpongeBobs! If this a scheme to collect two paychecks, forget about it! You're getting one paycheck split in two.
Both SpongeBobs: You are too good to us, Mr. Krabs. [Bubble transitions to Chum Bucket and comes to the copier]
Plankton: [laughs] Karen, did you know you're married to a genius?
Karen: How could I forget? [Scene shows a tattoo of Plankton on Karen's hard drive] You had it tattooed on my hard drive.
Plankton: Now where was I? Oh, yeah, I saved SpongeBob digital DNA. [Clicks "Print" again. Another sponge appears. Plankton squirts another drop of toner and the sponge comes alive. Plankton laughs.]
SpongeBob Copy: Ooh. [Eats Plankton]
Karen: No, no, SpongeCopy. We don't put dirty, nasty things in our mouth. Spit it out. [The copy spits Plankton out.]]
Plankton: Yuck! Now listen. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and you're to go straight to Mr. Krabs [whispering] and ask him for the secret formula.
SpongeBob Copy: Mr. Krabs, secret formula. Got it.
Plankton: And stay away from any other SpongeBobs!
SpongeBob Copy: Got it! [Eats Plankton again]
Karen: Ah! Ah! SpongeCopy! [Spits Plankton on the floor]
Plankton: You see, this is why I never had children.
[Scene transitions to Squidward looking at the SpongeBobs. One is eating ketchup and the other is juggling Krabby Patties.]
Squidward: Yup. I'm still dreaming. [To a customer] Hello, there. Are you enjoying my dream? [Slams his patty on the ground] I heard you like your patties "Ground"! [Laughs and goes over to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Mr. Squidward! Just what the devilfish do you think your doing?!
Squidward: Isn't it obvious, you red-faced tightwad? I'm dreaming! [Pulls down Mr. Krabs' pants] What's that under there?
Mr. Krabs: Under where?
Squidward: That's right. [Kicks Mr. Krabs into his office] ♪I don't care, I don't care, none of this is real.♪ Hmm, I always wanted to fly and since this is my dream, I'm going to fly! [Copy enters Krusty Krab and goes into Mr. Krabs's office.]
SpongeBob Copy: Hello, Mr. Krabs. Hey, can you tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula?
Mr. Krabs: You want me tell you the formula? That's quite a responsibility, laddy.
SpongeBob Copy: Secret formula.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you make a good point. Lean in boy! [Plankton is looking at them]
Plankton: He's doing it. He knows the formula. I can taste triumph! Wait, no! No!
SpongeBob Copy: Secret formula. Secret formula. Secret formu...
SpongeBob: Hey, look. Another handsome devil. [laughs] We'll call you Me Three [laughs again] Aww. Let's go flip some patties.
Plankton: Neptune's puddle! Now that SpongeBob's been corrupted by the other 2! What I need is a legion of Bobs. A full-lined blitz cream of Bobs. [Scene bubble transitions to Plankton playing a snare drum as a million copies of SpongeBob walk out of the Chum Bucket.] March! March, my pretties, and learn the formula!
SpongeBob Copies: Secret Formula. Secret Formula.
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! You guys are multiplying faster than me moneys! Alright, pipe down! I'm only going to tell you the secret formula one more time!
SpongeBob copies:  One more time! [all leave the office]
Mr. Krabs: So you've all memorized the formula. Now get to work! I have to calculate paychecks.
SpongeBob copies: Yay! Hooray!
Plankton: They all know the formula!
One SpongeBob Copy: Let me do that!
SpongeBob: Okay. Thanks.
[SpongeBob walks towards the mop, another copy pops out of the bucket.]
Another SpongeBob Copy: Let me do that!
SpongeBob: Sure.
Another SpongeBob copy: I'll polish the pickles.
SpongeBob:  [To Me Two] Looks like you sponges have everything covered.
Me Two:  Mm hmm. [Turns into light gray hue]
SpongeBob: Hey, you don't look so good. Can I take you home? Where do you live?
Me Two: I came from the Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob: The Chum Bucket?
Plankton: ♪I'm going to know the formula! I'm going to know the formula...♪
SpongeBob: Plankton! Me Two says you made him in a copy machine, so that you could steal the secret formula.
Plankton: Uh, well, that's pattonly ridiculous!
Me Two: Uhh...
SpongeBob: You got to help him! I think he's sick or something.
Me Two: I feel funny. [Vanishes]
SpongeBob: Me Two! Me Two! Oh! What happened to him?!
Plankton: I was afraid of that. I thought I'd save some money by using cheap toner.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Plankton: It means my plan is ruined! All the SpongeBob copies will fade away now!
SpongeBob: Fade away? All my brand new friends?! Nooooooooo! They can't! [Talking to Me Three] No! Don't disappear! [He disappears right after he says that. He cries.]
Plankton: Quickly, man! Before you fade, what's the formula?!
SpongeBob Copy: It's easy. You take one par... I don't feel so good [Disappears]
Plankton: Wait, no! [Each time he goes near a copy, he says The formula but then each copy disappears. Scene cuts to a bunch of other copies cleaning the roof, mowing the lawn, and some other things but they disappear. Then the scene cuts to Patrick playing with some of the copies but they disappear also.]
Patrick: Life is but a walking shadow. Ha-lube-lube-lube-lube-lube... [Stopped because he gets hit by a lawnmower and gets split into 9 mini copies of himself. Scene transitions to Plankton running over to the final copy.]
Plankton: What's the formula?! [Mr. Krabs enters.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I did it. I calculated 1 paycheck down into 300 separate tiny checks. Only one of you left? Here.
[The copy vanishes]
Plankton: Geez, what a cheapskate. [exits the Krusty Krab] I can't believe I failed again!
SpongeBob: [appears in front of Plankton] I can believe it.
Plankton: Wait, are you a copy?! Quick! What's the formula?!
SpongeBob: Well, you see, it's... [reveals his red tie] Nice try, Plankton. But I'm the O.S. The original sponge. [Grins, then frowns] I can't believe they're all gone.
Plankton: You wouldn't want all those copies of you around. They were just imitations anyway.
SpongeBob: Hey, those imitations were my friends.
Plankton: One SpongeBob is more than the world can handle anyway. You're a unique snowflake.
SpongeBob: Yeah, thanks, Plankton. Things did get a bit out of hand with all those me's around.
Plankton: Yeah, you're pretty annoying. Well, you can stomp on me now if that's you want.
SpongeBob: Plankton, I'm a unique snowflake, and snowflakes don't stomp. They skip. [He skips off-screen, laughing]
Plankton: Well, what do you know about that. No comeuppance!
Squidward: Gaining speed, increasing thrust, raising nose, air pressure on tentacles, stray tables in right position, and liftoff!
Plankton: Eh, spoke too soon. Comeuppance in three, two... [Gets crushed by Squidward] OW! Right on my keys!
[Episode ends]


[The episode begins inside Patrick's rock, where Patrick is watching his TV.]
Meredith: Did you get stuck in the pet door again?
Isopod: I ain't gonna lie to you, Meredith, [the isopod is shown stuck inside of a pet door],  I am not a happy camper!
Patrick: [laughs]
Announcer: We'll be right back with "The Giant Isopod Stuck in the Pet Door" show, after these messages!
Nick: Homes, homes, homes, homes, homes! I'm Nick Fishkins and I wanna buy your home!
Patrick: [confused] What?
Nick: You heard me, I wanna buy your home!
Patrick: But my home's not for sale.
Nick: [suddenly buff] It doesn't matter to me, any condition, [Nick lifts a barbell with two houses at each end] any size, I'll buy your home! Sold!
Patrick: [drops pizza and juice box] Sold? Where am I gonna live now?
[the scene transitions to SpongeBob blowing a feather into the air. He sees Patrick with a sack walking by.]
SpongeBob: What's happening, Patrick, you going on a hike?
Patrick: It's a forever hike.
SpongeBob: A forever hike?
Patrick: Yeah. All because of Nick Fishkins.
SpongeBob: Who's Nick Fishkins?
Patrick: He shows up on television and buys your home and there's nothing you can do about it. [saddened] Now I am doomed to walk the seas without a home.
SpongeBob: Aw, don't worry, Patrick, you can move in with me. We'll be roommates!
Patrick: Wow!
[transition to a shot of SpongeBob's pineapple at nighttime. Inside, SpongeBob and Patrick are watching TV while eating chips and popcorn. SpongeBob changes the channel, which happens to be the same commercial Patrick saw.]
Nick: I'm Nick Fishkins and I wanna buy your home! Sold!
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream and spit out their popcorn. The scene then transitions to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Gary, all with sacks, walking to the back of the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Well, we might as well spend the night here. [takes Gary off of his head]It's not so bad. We could make a home out of all this trash!
Patrick: [inside a broken bathtub while holding a steering wheel] Don't forget to make a garage for our new boat! [laughs]
[transition to Squidward's house, where it is just about the crack of dawn. A crowing sound is heard]
Squidward: [he wakes up from his slumber, only to realize something is strange] Hm? Huh, how strange. Usually, I wake up each morning with a dark feeling of dread gnawing at my stomach. But today, I feel positively... happy! [scene transition to Squidward walking happily with a rainbow over his head, singing] ♪Smilin' rainbows, smilin' sun, smilin' rocks, and vegetation! Look ma, I'm dancing, and hear my song! The world is lovely when nothing is wrong! Everything's smiling, yes even me! Is this what they call feeling happy?!♪ [he walks through the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is grabbing a trash bag from the trash can. As Squidward walks by happily, he takes Mr. Krabs' arm holding the trash. He proceeds to walk to the dumpster]
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Morning, Squidward!
Squidward: Good morning, SpongeBob! [he tosses the trash and Mr. Krabs' arm into the dumpster. As he proceeds to walk back into the Krusty Krab, he stops and realizes why he is so happy] Oh, that's why I felt great this morning, there was no SpongeBob.
Patrick: [offscreen] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [he notices SpongeBob, Patrick, Gary, looking like wrecks, relaxing around their newly-built house of trash] Oh, what did you numbskulls do with the trash?
SpongeBob: [the camera zooms out to reveal the entire house] Built a house. [a table holding a barrel, two pillows, and a photo falls over]
Squidward: What the-- why?
Patrick: Cause Nick Fishkins bought my home and then he bought SpongeBob's home.
SpongeBob: So now we live here.
Squidward: Oh, why didn't you just use the money that Nick Fishkins gave you to rent a room or buy a new home?
Patrick: Well, he hasn't paid us yet!
SpongeBob: Yeah, he said it right on the TV, "I wanna buy your home!" But we haven't seen any money!
Squidward: Ohhh... let me get this straight. You saw a TV commercial of Nick Fishkins saying he would buy your home and without meeting him or signing anything, you believe your homes have been sold? Now doesn't that seem weird, even to you?
Patrick: Really weird!
Squidward: Oh, listen you dumb-- [Squidward stops talking and realizes that SpongeBob and Patrick moving out is positive. He imagines himself in front of his house, forming a rainbow that destroys SpongeBob and Patrick's homes. After this, he makes a creepy smile] Uh, you know, looks like you guys got Fishkinned, and well, there's nothing you can do about that! [chuckles]
[transition to the next day, at dawn, where a clam is seen crowing like a rooster. SpongeBob wakes up in his "bed," drinks from a thrown-out soup can, and takes a "shower," which is actually Patrick dumping more trash on SpongeBob. After this, SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Ready for work, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [sees SpongeBob looking like a wreck] Wait a minute! What's the matter with you, boy? [view shows SpongeBob looking like a mess once again] You look like you slept in a pile of trash!
SpongeBob: A pile-of-trash house! Patrick and I built one out back with all your garbage!
Mr. Krabs: With my garbage? On my land?! I'll be chargin' ye a reasonable rental fee.
SpongeBob: [shocked] How much?
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... your paycheck oughtta cover it!
SpongeBob: Gee, I didn't know being homeless was so expensive.
[transition to Squidward in his cashier boat.]
Squidward: [checking his watch] Ah, work is done! [puts his hat in his pocket] Now I can go home to a SpongeBob-free zone and rearrange my doily collection!
SpongeBob: [runs up to Squidward] I miss the old neighborhood! I think I'm gonna visit my old house tonight!
Squidward: Uh, no, no, you don't wanna do that!
SpongeBob: Why?
Squidward: Well, a family has moved in there, with a lot of kids, and they don't like to be disturbed.
SpongeBob: How many's a lot?
Squidward: Oh, like, pfft, 12 kids!
SpongeBob: But if I just ask politely to visit do you think they--
Squidward: And they don't speak English! Uh, the Fishtraps only speak... German!
[SpongeBob, saddened by this, deflates]
Patrick: [on a table eating garbage] Maybe I can move in with whoever's in my house.
Squidward: No, no, no, uh, a band lives there now!
Patrick: A rock band?
Squidward: Um, yes.
Patrick: Cause my house is a rock?
Squidward: Yes, a big rock band with like eight people and all sorts of musical equipment so there's only room for musicians! [he leaves the Krusty Krab after responding]
SpongeBob: Hey, I could learn German!
Patrick: And I could learn what "learn" is.
[transition to Squidward's house at night. Inside, Squidward is reading a magazine while relaxing music plays on his record player.]
Squidward: Mmmm, nice! Ah, it's like a beautiful dream! So peaceful, no more aggravation! [he hears someone knocking on SpongeBob's pineapple. He looks outside and sees SpongeBob] What is that porous terror up to now? Oh no, he's expecting a big family that speaks German! [Squidward runs into his closet, grabs supplies, and runs to SpongeBob's house. He opens SpongeBob's door, dressed in a Tyrolean hat and lederhosen] Uh, German, hallo?
SpongeBob: Ach! Guten morgen! Mein name ist SpongeBob! (Oh! Good morning! My name is SpongeBob!)
Squidward: Say what?
SpongeBob: Guten morgen! Mein name ist SpongeBob! Ich bin gekommen um mein alte heimat besuchen. (Good morning! My name is SpongeBob! I have come to visit my old home.)
Squidward: Uh, please, vould you speaken-zee English, I need za bractize!
SpongeBob: Huh? Oh, ja, I mean, sure, good morning! My name is SpongeBob, what is your name?
Squidward: Umm... Gerhard.
SpongeBob: Well, hello, Gerhard, I used to live here. Just stopped by to visit my old home.
Squidward: Ach, meine Neptune, uh, now is nein such a good time mit the wife and zuch!
SpongeBob: [while Patrick is walking behind SpongeBob] Wife? Where is she?
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
Squidward: [panicked] She's shy... well, I must be going! Mein wifenz calling me for zupper! She is a fine Gutenchef of Fudenschlop!
SpongeBob: Um, would you mind if I stay for zupper? [SpongeBob enters his pineapple] Whatchya having?
Squidward: Umm... kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz.
SpongeBob: Kerglooginpfiefer, that's my favorite! Uh, what's your wife's name?
Squidward: I don't know... Hedvig! [Squidward grabs SpongeBob and puts him into his chair] Dunt movin! Not a schtepp! [SpongeBob tries to get out of the chair, but Squidward rushes and stops him before he could] Nein, nein! No moven sie! Sitz! [Squidward rushes back to his house, grabs more supplies, and rushes inside to Patrick's house. Patrick knocks on his rock, and Squidward open it, dressed as a rock star] Hey, man, like, what's happening?
Patrick: I missed my house, and I was hoping I could move back in.
Squidward: Oh, sorry, dude, no room. This place is, like, filled with band members and musical instruments.
Patrick: What do you play?
Squidward: Oh, pfft, the electric clarinet.
Patrick: There's no such thing!
Squidward: [a little nervous] Sure there is.
Patrick: Prove it!
Squidward: I'll be right back! [Squidward runs back to his house, grabs his clarinet, attaches a speaker into it, grabs more musical equipment, then runs back to Patrick's house. The camera then zooms over to SpongeBob sitting in his chair]
SpongeBob: Oh, Gerhard! Are you coming back?
Squidward: [pops up behind Patrick's rock, and sneaks back to SpongeBob's pineapple, still in his rock band outfit]
SpongeBob: Hello! [SpongeBob gets out of his chair and shakes Squidward's hand] You must be Hedvig!
Squidward: Hedvig? [now pretending to be Hedvig] Oh, oh ja, that's me, Hedvig!
SpongeBob: I have heard so much about your kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz! Can't wait to try it.
Squidward: One-- [in Hedvig's voice] One second! [Squidward grabs a trash can full of garbage, dumps it onto a plate, and gives it to SpongeBob] Tonight's zupper is to go, so please, to go!
SpongeBob: Well aren't your twelve little German children gonna sing for me while I eat?
Squidward: I don't have children! [realizing what he said] I mean- I mean, ja, ja, outside please! [Squidward pushes SpongeBob outside]
SpongeBob: I love outdoor concerts.
[Squidward closes SpongeBob's door and rushes back to Patrick's house. He opens the rock to reveal himself playing an "electric" clarinet. Patrick is satisfied by this.]
Squidward: Uh, groovy enough for ya, man?
Patrick: That was great! You should give lessons to my ex-neighbor, Squidward! He stinks!
[Squidward growls, closes Patrick's rock and then runs back to SpongeBob's house. Patrick itches his back and walks to SpongeBob's front entrance, where he sees SpongeBob.]
Patrick: What's going on?
SpongeBob: Shhh! The Fishtrap children are gonna sing!
Squidward: [with puppets on his tentacles] ♪Ve are der little kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, ve are der little kiddievinks, ve love to sing all day!♪
SpongeBob: [eating part of his "kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz"] I think the littlest kiddywink is off-key.
Patrick: They need a band. I'll go talk to the guys that live in my old place, and see if they can come over to play along!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: [frustrated by this] That's it, I'm done! [he takes off his wig and puppets]
SpongeBob: Squidward?! What are you doing in the Fishtraps' house?
Squidward: You idiots! It's not the Fishtraps' house, it's your house, and that is still Patrick's house! You just saw a commercial-- that's all!
Patrick: So... is Nick Fishkins gonna live in my house?
Squidward: [stops growling] He doesn't live in the houses he buys.
SpongeBob: Well if he doesn't live in them, what does he do with them?
Squidward: He flips the houses, you dimwits! He buys houses then resells them for a profit! He flips houses for a living!
Patrick: He flips houses for a living?
Squidward: Yes! And I'm calling Nick Fishkins right now to come over and flip my house, so I can move away! [walks away mumbling angrily]
SpongeBob: Poor Squidward. We should do something really nice for him!
Patrick: [gets an idea] I know!
[The scene transitions to SpongeBob and Patrick each holding one end of Squidward's house.]
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick! On the count of three! One... two... three! [SpongeBob and Patrick flip over Squidward's house on its side, while Squidward is screaming inside. His house proceeds to fall upside down. Then, Nick Fishkins pulls up]
Nick: Say, is this the home of Squidward Tentacles? The one that was for sale?
SpongeBob: Sure is!
Nick: Yeesh. This place is a wreck! I'm Nick Fishkins and I do not wanna buy this home! Not sold! [a sign reading "NOT SOLD!" appears in front of Nick. He then drives away]
Squidward: [coming out from the top of his flipped home] What happened?
SpongeBob: We flipped your house for ya.
Squidward: Who's that driving away?
Patrick: That was Nick Fishkins.
Squidward: And what did he say?
Patrick: He said "Yeesh! Who'd wanna live in that thing? Not sold!"
Squidward: I... I can't believe you did that!
[SpongeBob and Patrick return to their homes.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: You're welcome!
[Squidward's house crumbles into pieces.]
Squidward: Ow! Ach du lieber... [the episode ends]


[the episode opens up on the island of Bikini Atoll, where a crane of a ship holds a crate. The rope breaks, decelerating the supply of fortune cookies down to Bikini Bottom]
SpongeBob: Whoa, look at that cloud, Gary! It looks just like a giraffe eating ice cream.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary, all this cloud-watching is making me hungry too. Ooh, look at that big one, Gary!
Gary: [gets shocked] Meow!
SpongeBob: It's getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, [Gary yowls as he slowly crawls away] and bigger, and— ow! [SpongeBob gets crushed by the giant box of fortune cookies]
Gary: Meow. [sniffs the box]
SpongeBob: [emerges from the sand] Hey Gary, that was a pretty heavy cloud.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary, it's not a cloud at all. [SpongeBob pushes himself out of the sand] Let's see what's inside. [SpongeBob then removes a piece of the box and releases all of the fortune cookies] Whoo, fortune cookies! Vague prophecies baked into delicious bite-sized snacks. These cookies can see the future, Gary, which means they knew we were hungry, even before we did. Let's eat!
[SpongeBob and Gary begin eating the fortune cookies. SpongeBob opens his fortune and starts reading it]
SpongeBob: "A great fortune has fallen upon you." [gasps] Did you hear that Gary, the fortune is true! Let's look at your future. [Gary hands SpongeBob his fortune] "Happy trails will follow you always." [gasps and points at Gary's slime trail] Your fortune came true too!
[Gary then looks behind him to gaze at his trail]
SpongeBob: Cookies with fortunes that actually come true? We have to share these with everybody!
[the scene transitions to the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is declining SpongeBob's idea]
Mr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob, we are not handing out anything free with every purchase! Even the smiles here cost a nickel.
SpongeBob: Aw, why not, Mr. Krabs?
Squidward: [chuckles] Because, SpongeBob, fortune cookie fortunes are always lame and they never come true.
SpongeBob: Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Squidward. These fortune cookies are different, try one. [Hands him the fortune cookie]
Squidward: [backs it away] No. [SpongeBob pushes it back to him] Way.
[SpongeBob forces Squidward to eat the cookie by controlling his arms and shoving the cookie in his mouth. The fortune exits Squidward's mouth like a receipt and he reluctantly reads it]
Squidward: "You will be rewarded for your particular talent." Right. [SpongeBob turns Squidward around]
French Purser: Excuse me, Mr. Squidward Tentacles, you have just won the most miserable cashier in Bikini Bottom contest. Here is your cash prize! [Hands Squidward the money and begins celebrating]
Squidward: Holy harpoons, the fortune did come true!
Mr. Krabs: [snatches the money] Me cash register, me money. [walks away]
Squidward: And that's why my depression is award-winning.
SpongeBob: [Mr. Krabs shoving money into his pants] Don't you see, Mr. Krabs, the fortunes in those cookies are real. Can't we share them with everyone?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps and coughs] You know, you're right, SpongeBob. [pledging] We will share these magical macaroons with all the folks in Bikini Bottom. You just leave it to me.
SpongeBob: [jumps in excitement] All right!
Squidward: [throws confetti] Hooray. [tilts head down]
Mr. Krabs: [as he is ready to give free fortune cookies to his customers] This is how you hook them! [shoves a funnel in SpongeBob's pore] Now remember, the first one is free! [grabs a load of fortune cookies and implants them into SpongeBob to throw out to the customers]
Dale: [opens and eats a cookie, then reads fortune] "Something wonderful is about to happen to you." [gets licked by a group of worm puppies then giggles] I love puppies. Thanks, fortune cookie!
Mable-Monica: "Eat your hat and you will fall in love." [takes her hat off to eat and sees Lenny eating his hat. They both run to each other, dancing and kissing]
Mable-Monica and Lenny: Thanks  fortune cookie!
Ivy: "You will soon injure your legs?!" [Piano crashes down on Ivy's legs] My legs! I was looking for an excuse to get out of jury duty. [plays piano] Thanks fortune cookie!
SpongeBob: Those fortune cookies are a hit. [the crowd then runs towards him, knocking him down. A crowd is shown outside the Krusty Krab, which attracts Plankton's attention]
Plankton: [while riding a small chopper] Fortune cookies at the Krusty Krab, aye? Well, Eugene, I have a prediction too. You are in for an epic fail supreme with extra cheese! [evil laugh]
Karen: Sheldon! Where are you!?
[Plankton then flies away only to hit the fist and he falls into the Chum Bucket, landing in front of Karen]
Plankton: Barnacles, woman, would it kill you to leave me alone for five minutes?!
Karen: Sorry, your lordship, but the garbage isn't going to take itself out. [drops the garbage bag on Plankton, smashing him]
Plankton: [slips out from under bag] Riddle me this, computer wife, what's hollow, full of lies, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth?
Karen: Our marriage? [she then shows an image of a wedding ring]
Plankton: No! Fortune cookies. And Krabs is raking it in right now because all of his fortunes are actually coming true?! So...
Karen: [imitating Plankton] So, you got an evil plan to get the Krabby Patty secret formula and soon it will be yours, all yours. [evil imitated laugh]
Plankton: [surprised] Wow, I can't tell if you're sarcastic or psychic.
Karen: Ugh. [rolls eyes]
[the scene transitions to a chuckling Plankton, who is creating fortune cookies with bad messages in them]
Plankton: This will be a good one, [types] "You stink." [evil laugh while Karen is packaging the cookies]
[the scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, where Plankton is bringing in a load of bad fortune cookies and vaporizes the original ones]
Plankton: Enjoy your new fortune cookies, Krabs!
SpongeBob: [singing] Time for a refill. [takes the load of bad fortune cookies to the Krusty Krab]
[the Krusty Krab is loaded, Mr. Krabs' eyes turn to dollar signs, and Squidward is selling the cookies without a break]
Lenny: What is my future?
Squidward: [his tentacle cracks] My tentacles are going to fall off if I don't get a break soon, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [pushes Squidward away] Look out, Mr. Squidward, I'll teach ya how to run a cash register. [pacing to put the money in the register and runs out of fortune cookies] Huh? More cookies, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Fortunes flying in, Mr. Krabs. [drops a load of cookies]
Plankton: Let the wave of misfortune begin. [chuckles as he flies away]
Dale: "You will get stomach cramps from the Krusty Krab?!"
Mable: "The octopus with the big nose just spit in your food?!" [Squidward wipes his nose]
Frankie Billy: "A yellow sponge will serve you salmonella?!"
Ivy: "You will live forever if you eat at the Chum Bucket?!" [Crowd gasps]
Susie Rechid: Let's eat at the Chum Bucket. [crowd agrees, runs over SpongeBob who is mopping the floor, and runs down to the Chum Bucket]
[Mr. Krabs loses his customers, causing his dollar eye pupils to turn to cents. The two cents fall to the cash register and Mr. Krabs closes it. The "no sale" sign appears in the register. The scene transitions to the Chum Bucket, where it is jam-packed with customers]
Mr. Krabs: [Plankton holds a fortune cookie as he secretly jumps on the chair] What did we ever do to those fortune cookies to make them lie about us like that?
SpongeBob: Well, the fortunes in those cookies were always right before. [Plankton jumps in the fortune cookie bowl] Here Mr. Krabs, maybe this next one will change your luck.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs picks up a cookie, secretly given to him by Plankton, opens it, and starts reading the fortune teller] "Unless you give a tiny copepod the Krabby Patty secret formula, you will die?!"
Plankton: [opera voice] Hello! [normal voice] Did someone say copepod?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs shriek, and starts running with fear to his office, where SpongeBob locks the door and Mr. Krabs puts a plank in the way]
Plankton: Just wanted to borrow a cup of grease, Eugene. I'll come back later, ciao!
Mr. Krabs: [nervously speaking] J-just how true are these cookie fortunes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: If the cookie says it's true, then it's true. Horribly, terribly, truthfully, true! [begins wailing]
Mr. Krabs: "You will die." [the world "die" echoes in his head three times, leading to a vision of Mr. Krabs' funeral service]
Pearl: [sobbing] Oh, I'll miss you, daddy! [continues sobbing then she takes his wallet] But I really can't wait to spend your hard-earned money on shoes! [laughs and runs away]
Mr. Krabs: [wakes up] Me money!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! No! [weeping tears and filling up Mr. Krabs' coffin, causing him to float down and hit his head on the floor. Vision ends]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs, it's time. [SpongeBob's arm breaks off while holding on to Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs gets scared as SpongeBob appears on his other side] It's time to give up the secret formula to Plankton! [puts back his arm] Because your life is worth more than some scrap of paper in a bottle.
Mr. Krabs: You're right, me boy-o, [heads toward his safe] I've got to face me fortune. [takes secret formula out of safe]
[the transition cuts to the Chum Bucket, where Karen is controlling the crowd]
Karen: Don't crowd, there's more Chumbalaya where that came from, unfortunately. [Plankton is feeding the customers]
Crowd: [gags]
Frankie Billy: "It's worth it to live forever."
Plankton: The scheme is working perfectly, [sees Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob approaching the Chum Bucket] and here comes gullible Krabs now to hand-deliver the secret formula. [tears up] I promised myself I wouldn't cry. [chuckles]
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are having trouble getting inside the Chum Bucket]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this crowd is impossible!
SpongeBob: [snatches secret formula] Leave it to me, Mr. Krabs. I'll make sure Plankton gets his so you won't get yours. [prepares to run to the crowd] Hot stuff comin' through! [jumps inside the crowd. Places the secret formula on his head then he swims through the crowd to Plankton but he sinks]
Plankton: Don't worry, secret formula, I'm comin', baby!
[Plankton then jumps in his boat to grab the secret formula, but SpongeBob is off-balance, so Plankton uses his fishing rod to grab the formula]
Plankton: Me want that papa! [SpongeBob lands on Plankton, destroying the boat]
SpongeBob: [hands out formula] Here Plankton, Mr. Krabs wants you to have this.
Plankton: [chuckles] Finally! [Plankton reaches for formula, but an anchovy sticks his head up, knocking the formula away] No! [he jumps to the floor where he finds it rolling] Ah-hah. [the bottle is kicked towards him, which flattens him out. He gets up, balances on the bottle, but then is kicked to the ground. Plankton then tries to run from a customer wearing large, green boots, but he gets stepped on. Plankton's squashed body gets up from the ground] I have had enough! [still, in a squished form, he rolls to a chum bucket] Get out of my restaurant, you mindless sheep! I wrote those fortunes, [crowd gasps] they were fakes, don't you get it?! Now all of you, out! [growling]
Dale: Let's go back to the Krusty Krab! [crowd agrees and starts running back to the Krusty Krab]
[Mr. Krabs receives his formula back]
Plankton: I guess I didn't really think that through.
Mr. Krabs: I figured the funeral fortune was phony, Plankton.
Plankton: Oh, yeah?! What are you going to do about it, Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, Sheldon. [holds a fortune cookie] Here, have a fortune cookie. [gives Plankton the fortune cookie]
Plankton: [opens fortune cookie and starts reading the fortune teller] Eh. "You will go on a long voyage where you will get everything you deserve." [gets picked up by Mr. Krabs] Hey!
[the ending follows to a Chinese restaurant where Plankton pops out of a fortune cookie and is avoiding the chopsticks]
Plankton: Ahh! Hey! [gets grabbed by the chopsticks] Ooh! Mommy! [a chomping noise is heard]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick having a fun time in Jellyfish Fields. They attempt to catch some jellyfish but snagged themselves with the nets while there are jellyfish on their heads. Patrick removes his net and the jellyfish stings him, swelling his head. The same thing happens to SpongeBob. They both laugh at each other because of how funny they look. The scene changes to them skipping down the road. Then the scene changes to them brushing their teeth near a mirror at a mirror store, which puzzles several bystanders. Then the scene changes to them at the outlet store. They both slip into a large pair of pants. Then they wobble out of the store.]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh.
Patrick: No, no, just—
SpongeBob: Whoa. [grunts]
[The scene changes to the Barg'N-Mart where SpongeBob and Patrick are wobbling in the freezer aisle. As they wobble, they knock over a few things until they lose their balance and fall over.]
Patrick: It's harder to walk, but worth it.
[They stand back up.]
SpongeBob: Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day: buying ourselves the perfect ice cream.
[SpongeBob's opens the freezer door.]
Patrick: So many flavors.
[A huge stack of ice cream is shown with various flavors. At the top, a mountain climber appears and yodels. SpongeBob and Patrick jump into the freezer.]
Both: Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Hmm, what brand should we buy, Hogen Duep?
Patrick: No, that's too fancy.
[SpongeBob and Patrick search through the pile until they find one carton of ice cream with the flavor rocky road.]
Both: Rocky road!
Patrick: With real rocks!
SpongeBob: Rocky road, unlike our friendship, which is a smooth avenue and will never have any bumps.
[Moments later, Mr. Krabs comes by with a shopping cart and unintentionally shuts the freezer door on SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Mr. Krabs: Bump. [notices SpongeBob and Patrick trapped in the freezer, not knowing it was them] When did food get so ugly?
[Mr. Krabs opens the freezer door and takes out one of the frozen dinner boxes while SpongeBob and Patrick are stuck to the door.]
Mr. Krabs: [reading] "Lonely Krab Dinner for One: Now 30% lonelier." Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient.
[Mr. Krabs takes out a few frozen dinner boxes and puts them in his cart. SpongeBob and Patrick slide off the door. SpongeBob slides over to the shopping cart, takes one of the boxes, and looks at it.]
SpongeBob: Can you imagine if they had frozen Krabby Patties at the supermarket? Oh, that would be so convenient, everyone in the world could enjoy them.
[Mr. Krabs' nose ignites like a dynamite and his eyes pops into confetti, which resulted in giving him an idea.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, that's a million dollar idea that I just had that you just said before me.
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab being recorded for a commercial. Mr. Krabs is at the front doors where he is in between two tables. One table had a plate of Krabby Patties and the other had a box labeled "Frozen Krabby Patties." During the commercial, SpongeBob peeks through the window.]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, welcome to my commercial. Would you like the convenience of a Krabby Patty at home, without the hassle of going to the Krusty Krab? Well, now you can. [takes a patty] Have delicious Krabby Patties any time you want. [stuffs patty in the box] They're in your grocer's freezer section. Buy them. I want your money! Did you get that, Pearly-girl?
Pearl: Yes, Daddy, and stop babying me!
[Pearl turns off the camera. The video is shown to a local business executive named Don Grouper. The TV turns off and the picture of Don closes.]
Mr. Krabs: So, Mr. Grouper, what do you think?
Don Grouper: Call me Don.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, well, okay, Don. Will this make me rich?
[Don thinks for a few seconds. As some sort of Easter egg, his thinking face is the same as his picture.]
Don Grouper: Mr. Krabs, if you wanna sell zero Krabby Patties and wind up in the poor house, then I say go with your commercial.
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
Don Grouper: But if you really want to be rich, keep your mouth shut, and listen to us, sir. [tooth sparkle]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. Okay.
[Don pushes the button on the remote, opens the floor and reveals four more executives.]
Don Grouper: Let me introduce you to the team here at GGK. That's Barry Goby, Rob Koi, and Limia with her team from creative. Everyone, this is Mr. Krabs and a yellow box.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, actually, my name is Spon-
Don Grouper: Let's say we give a look-see at what we've cooked up for you.
[Don pushes the button on the remote, which shuts the blinds on the windows and turns on a hologram of a Krabby Patty.]
Don Grouper: The Krabby Patty, a mainstay of dining in Bikini Bottom for a very long time, [SpongeBob tries to touch the hologram, but Mr. Krabs stops him.] like an old friend, but not too old, because research shows us old is gross.
Limia: Yes, oh, it's absolutely...
Barry Goby: Oh, of course...
Rob Koi: Just gross.
Barry Goby: Yeah, no, it's disgusting.
Old executive: Well, I don't think old is gross.
[Don pushes the button on the remote and opens a trapdoor for the old executive to fall through. The old executive is replaced by a baby executive. The baby spits out its pacifier, takes out her phone and texts it.]
Baby executive: Goo-goo, social networking, ah, ah!
Don Grouper: Exactly. Now, here are some of the slogans we've been kicking around.
[Don pushes the button on the remote and shows Martin walking with a Krabby Patty.]
Don Grouper: "Krabby Patties: Like a friend, but edible." [shows another one with a delivery man] "Krabby Patties: The shut-in's favorite patty." [shows another with two Krabby Patties on a cliff] And finally, "Krabby Patties: Shove 'em in your mouth-hole!" [mouth-hole burps]
SpongeBob: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I have a slogan!
[The executives stare at SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, "Krabby Patties: Taste so nice that they... taste nice."
[Don is silent. The other executives nod their heads in disagreement. The baby executive blows a raspberry.]
Mr. Krabs: Let's just leave it to the professionals, boy-o.
Don Grouper: The thing is, Frozen Krabby Patties are a convenience for everyone, and we need a campaign that says exactly that. We need a regular guy to represent all consumers.
SpongeBob: Me!
Don Grouper: Someone everyone can relate to...
SpongeBob: Oh, me, me!
Don Grouper: With a face that says, "I love Krabby Patties."
[As Don thinks, SpongeBob winks his eyes. One eye has the letter I on it. The other has a heart on it. SpongeBob then reveals a Krabby Patty on his tongue.]
Don Grouper: We find that face, and we have our campaign.
Mr. Krabs: And I've got the perfect guy for the job.
[SpongeBob happily grins. Then a frozen Krabby Patty box is shown being put in the microwave by Patrick. Patrick is sitting on a recliner chair, opens the microwave, takes out the Krabby Patty from the box, and eats it.]
Patrick: Krabby Patties: They taste so nice, that they taste nice.
[The filmmaker claps the clapperboard and the scene is finished. Patrick gets of the chair.]
SpongeBob: Hey, that was my slogan.
[Don walks over to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs with Patrick.]
Don Grouper: Great stuff, huh? This guy is gonna be a star!
Patrick: I'm already a star.
Don Grouper: That's the attitude.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, now that I'm finished doing whatever it is I'm doing, you wanna go play?
SpongeBob: [gasps]
Limia: Sorry, yellow box, Patrick has to make a personal appearance at the mall.
SpongeBob: I—oh...
[SpongeBob sadly walks away.]
Mr. Krabs: Don, will this commercial really help me make money?
Don Grouper: You need to call your bank, Krabs, because they are gonna have to build an extra vault to hold all the extra money.
[Mr. Krabs faints into Don's arms.]
Mr. Krabs: [in Southern accent] Ooh, I do declare, Mr. Grouper, I believe I have a case of the vapors.
Don Grouper: I told you, call me Don. [tooth sparkle]
Mr. Krabs: Don.
Don Grouper: Of course, you could double, maybe even triple or quadruple that money, if you... No, forget it.
Mr. Krabs: What? Forget what? What? What?! What are you saying?
Don Grouper: Well, we ran some numbers and realized that you could make a lot more money if you... changed the formula.
Mr. Krabs: How much "a lot more"?
Don Grouper: A lot "a lot more."
Mr. Krabs: Well, then let's fill her up with filler!
[SpongeBob walks back in, having heard what Don just said.]
SpongeBob: [shocked] Mr. Krabs, are you changing the secret Krabby Patty formula?
Mr. Krabs: Heh, no, I-I can— well, it's just a little tweak, me boy.
SpongeBob: But what is "filler"?
Don Grouper: [walks over to SpongeBob and squishes his head to avoid more questions.] Whoa, hey, this little yellow box sure is full of questions. What do you say we go see where the money's made?
Mr. Krabs: Ho-ho, that sounds great!
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab with a large factory built behind it. Don is driving a cart while SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs ride in it.]
Don Grouper: Take a look around. It's your dream come true. Through the wonders of automation, this factory can make as many Krabby Patties in one minute as you used to make in a week. Take a whiff of the future, Krabs. Does it smell like money?
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] Oh, yeah.
[During the tour, one of the workers ended up on the conveyor belt and is burned and frozen in the process.]
SpongeBob: Hey, why does that barrel say "sand"?
[SpongeBob point to a filler where workers are suspiciously filling it with sand.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's imported. It's spelled "sand" but it's pronounced, "filler."
Don Grouper: Hey, let's check in on our taste test area.
[Don drives to cart towards the test lab in a fast motion. He stops and SpongeBob flies into the window of the lab. SpongeBob slides off the window. Mr. Krabs and Don looks into the window where a taste test of the frozen Krabby Patty is being performed.]
Fish Guy: Hmm. This tastes kind of bad.
Limia: [holds up a dinner box with Patrick on it.] Would you buy it, though?
Fish Guy: Well, yeah, for the convenience... and the face of that stupid guy [chuckles] Though I have noticed a bit of a side effect. Hmm-hmm.
[The fish guy points to his behind as it appears to have gotten bigger. Limia calls for security and the guards carry the fish guy out,]
Limia: [laugh] He loves it.
[Two executives drive up, one of which resembles the vacation salesman from That's No Lady.]
Executive: Great news, Krabs. Sales are going all the way up to the surface of the ocean. Here's your first check.
[The executive gives Mr. Krabs a check. His check revealed to be 100 million dollars. The date on the check says 1/28/16. This hints that this episode takes place in January 28, 2016.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
[Mr. Krabs opens the check further and reveals more zeroes at the end, meaning he has made a lot of money. He gasps and looks at the back and sees even more zeroes. His pupils scream. Mr. Krabs faints in Don's arms again.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm rich, boy-o, rich!
SpongeBob: Great, can we go back to the Krusty Krab now?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes, we can.
SpongeBob: Hooray, finally!
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab with a Patrick robot on the roof. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs enter the restaurant as workers are building inside. SpongeBob runs into the kitchen, takes out his spatula and prepares to make Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: Whatcha doing, boy?
SpongeBob: Making Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, you've made your last Krabby Patty.
[Nat comes in and brings a robotic SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: You mean my last one for the morning rush?
Mr. Krabs: No, ever.
[Nat moves SpongeBob away from his position with a forklift.]
SpongeBob: You mean my last one for today-ever?
Mr. Krabs: No, I mean forever and ever. You're fired.
SpongeBob: [confused] Fired?
[Nat takes the spatula.]
Mr. Krabs: But I'm ready to re-hire you.
SpongeBob: Oh, please, re-hire me Mr. Krabs. I'll do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Then follow me.
[Mr. Krabs leads SpongeBob out of the kitchen. The robotic SpongeBob looks at SpongeBob with red eyes as he leaves. He shows animatronic robots of Patrick, Squidward, and various customers in the restaurant. The Krusty Krab has somehow turned into a museum under Don Grouper's orders.]
Robot Patrick: This tastes nice.
[A robotic Plankton is at the safe and is hammered by a robot Mr. Krabs.]
Robot Plankton: Ow, curses, foiled again, ow.
SpongeBob: You turned the Krusty Krab into some kind of museum?
Mr. Krabs: That's right, me boy. It's all history now, but you, you have the most important job of all. [carries SpongeBob to the gift shop.] You give tours and sell tchotchkes in the gift shop.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but what if someone wants a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, we've got plenty of Krabby Patties right here in the freezer.
[Mr. Krabs takes out a frozen Krabby Patty, puts it in the microwave, and heats it up.]
Patrick Microwave: Ding.
[Mr. Krabs takes out the heated up Krabby Patty.]
Mr. Krabs: You see? Customers at the museum can cook the patties themselves, like this.
[Mr. Krabs eats the Krabby Patty. However, he does not appear to be enjoying it because of the taste.]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, it's so convenient, see? [chuckles]
[Squidward walks in.]
Squidward: And what about me?
[Mr. Krabs swallows the patty and puts it in his pocket.]
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired.
Squidward: Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?
Mr. Krabs: Heh! No, you're just fired.
Squidward: What? No, you don't fire me—I quit! I got my resignation letter all prepared. [reads resignation letter] "Dear Mr. Krabs—"
Mr. Krabs: Do you have a ticket, sir? Can't be in a museum without a ticket.
Squidward: What the—what?! [continues reading as he is being carried out by a delivery man] "I-I-I tender my resignation from this greasy establishment. Too long have I toiled under your iron claw. Now I am free—free to live my dreams of being a ballet dancer, ha-ha, and the first chair clarinet in the Bikini Bottom Orchestra, ha-ha, and I am going to finally publish my mystery/thriller novel: 'Dial D for Doily!"
[Mr. Krabs places a Krabby Patty shaped hat on SpongeBob's head and opens the front door to let customers in.]
SpongeBob: Ahem, [reads card] "hello, and welcome to the Krusty Krab Museum, the original home of the Krabby Patty, now available in the frozen food section of your local supermarket."
[The robotic Squidward behind SpongeBob explodes.]
SpongeBob: Oh, and don't forget to buy souvenirs at the gift shop.
Mr. Krabs: Atta boy, embrace the future!
[Mr. Krabs leaves. The robotic Squidward's head lands on the floor. As time passes by, customers with larger butts continue to by Frozen Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs goes to the bank and gives the bank loaner a check. The loaner gives Mr. Krabs a huge sack of money, which resulted in Mr. Krabs fainting. The loaner pushes the bag off of the counter. Patrick is at the Barg'N-Mart signing autographs to his fans. SpongeBob attempts to get Patrick's attention. But due to the popularity, he is being ignored as Patrick is busy signing autographs to his fans. Mr. Krabs is in his swimsuit and goes into a pool of money. He swims all around the pool. Then he pulls down a lever and money pours down on him. The scene then changes to a local hotel where it is built at the spot where Patrick's house used to be. SpongeBob goes into the hotel.]
Elevator operator: Going up?
[SpongeBob goes into the elevator.]
SpongeBob: I'm going to a party—a party to celebrate my friend's upcoming 400th commercial.
Elevator operator: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: I brought ice cream. Me and my best friend are gonna share the ice cream. Who knows? Maybe we'll even get a chance to share pants. [laughs] Again.
Elevator operator: [grossed out] You should get out. Now.
[SpongeBob leaves the elevator and goes into a room filled with rich people at Patrick's party.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.
Colonel Sandab: Uh, Patrick, did you order something through the mail? 'Cause a yellow box just arrived for you.
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, I'm sure glad you made it to my party.
Colonel Sandab: Uh, excuse me, yellow box, are you feeling a little overheated? Because I do—I say, I do believe that you are melting. [laughs]
[The snotty rich people laugh at SpongeBob as the ice cream melts.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, I guess I should get this in a freezer. Patrick, where's the kitchen?
Patrick: Oh, I don't know.
Limia: It's just past the solid gold gym. Take a right at the zoo.
SpongeBob: I'll come with you, SpongeBob.
Limia: He can find the kitchen by himself. The press needs some photos of you with your new mascot friends.
SpongeBob: [sadly] Aww.
Patrick: [sadly] Aww.
[SpongeBob sulks to the kitchen freezer and opens it. In it is a huge stack of HOGAN DUEP ice cream. A yodel is heard in the background. SpongeBob looks sadly at the freezer. He didn't bother to put the ice cream he brought to the party in the freezer, so he places it on the countertop. He sulks away as Patrick is getting photos from the press.]
Press: This way, Mr. Star! Hey, Patrick, over here! Over here, right here! Who are you wearing?
French Narrator: The next day...
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sulking at the front door of the Krusty Krab Museum. He sighs and puts on the Krabby Patty hat. He walks into the former restaurant and trips over Squidward's foot.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, oof!
Squidward: Ow.
SpongeBob: [his body is face-down but his face come out and sees Squidward] Squidward? What are you doing here? I thought you were off following your dreams.
Squidward: I was. They turned out to be nightmares. Apparently, you need more than 17 years behind a cash register to be qualified for dreams. [holds out paper that reveals that Squidward has been a cashier for exactly 17 years.] I never thought I would say this, but I'm begging you, SpongeBob, let me come back and work at the Krusty Krab Museum.
SpongeBob: I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off.
Robot Squidward: I love my job. Thanks for coming!
Squidward: Totally out of character.
[Squidward takes the Krusty Krab hat, pushes the robotic Squidward out of the register boat, and takes over.]
Squidward: [mechanical-esque] I hate everyone. [regular] Huh, much better.
French Narrator: Later...
[The scene changes to the filmmakers at the Krusty Krab Museum setting up for a commercial.]
Patrick: [reads script] "Tastes so nice that they—"
Squidward: They taste like lice!
Patrick: Oh, now I gotta start over! Ooh, someone fix that broken robot.
Squidward: Huh?
[Nat grabs Squidward and flips him over. Then he takes out a drill and proceeds to painfully drill Squidward in the behind.]
Squidward: What are you doing with this—ow!
Patrick: [reads script] "Tastes so nice that they taste nice."
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, rehearsing your big 400th commercial, huh?
Limia: Excuse me, yellow box, Mr. Star is not to be disturbed. He's very, very busy right now.
SpongeBob: Yeah, sure. I get it.
[SpongeBob sulks away.]
Patrick: But he's my friend.
Limia: You're a star. You have no friends.
[Limia walks away and Don comes to check on Patrick.]
Patrick: [sighs] What am I doing again?
Don Grouper: Stand over here and say your line. And...action.
[Don gives Patrick a Krabby Patty before he leaves for the filming to begin. Patrick is standing next to a table of Frozen Krabby Patties with the number 400 sign. Patrick eats the patty but doesn't appeared to be thrilled with it.]
Patrick: Tastes so nice, it... uh... [Patrick throws down the Krabby Patty and starts looking and acting depressed.] blah, blah, blahblahbli-blah...
[Patrick becomes depressed as the 400 sign lights up. Confetti is then released.]
Don Grouper: And..cut! Alright, you guys can fix that in post. Okay? that's a wrap. Let's pack it up.
[Limia walks up with a contract for Patrick to sign.]
Limia: Okay, and here. And here. Okay, and then sign here. And again here.
SpongeBob: Patrick, there's something weird about these Frozen Krabby Patties.
[SpongeBob notices a filmmaker eating one of the Frozen Krabby Patty. After he eats it, he goes to remove the headlight and his behind becomes larger.]
Filmmaker 2: Looks like you've been hitting the patties pretty hard there.
Filmmaker 1: Speak for yourself.
[The other filmmaker's behind is larger than the other.]
SpongeBob: Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out. [continues as filmmaker is carrying SpongeBob] I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrick—oof!
[The filmmaker places SpongeBob in a box that comically contains yellow boxes.]
Limia: Come on, Mr. Star. You've got an 11:00 eyeball waxing.
Patrick: [sighs] See you later, SpongeBob.
[Patrick sulks away.]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Aww.
[Patrick and Limia walk up to a limo where they are driven away, while a bicyclist follows them with a sign that says "Eat Frozen Krabby Patties." Meanwhile, Plankton sneaks by, hoping that he will finally get the secret formula.]
Plankton: Finally, now is my chance to strike.
[Plankton runs into the museum.]
SpongeBob: Welcome to the original Krusty—
[Plankton runs up to the safe where the robotic Plankton and Mr. Krabs are being operated.]
Robot Plankton: Curses, foiled again. Curses, foiled again.
Plankton: Pfft, never happened.
[Plankton jumps into the safe, grabs the formula, and kicks the robotic Plankton.]
Plankton: Now to make my escape.
[Plankton make his escape as he laughs. Surprisingly, robotic Mr. Krabs's hammer does not smash Plankton. However, he stops to notice that SpongeBob is not in the mood for chasing him.]
Plankton: Aren't you gonna try and stop me?
SpongeBob: That'll be $1.99, please.
Plankton: What do you mean, $1.99? You're not gonna step on me? I've got the secret formula, you know.
SpongeBob: Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop.
[SpongeBob takes one of the bottles and pulls out a blank paper.]
SpongeBob: See? They're all just fakes. [rips up the paper] Everything here is a fake!
Plankton: Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to? [smashes bottle] All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go.
Patrick Microwave: Ding.
[SpongeBob takes the patty out of the microwave and gives it to Plankton.]
Plankton: [laughs] Yes, you fools!
[Plankton runs off.]
Squidward: Shouldn't we chase after him? He didn't pay.
SpongeBob: Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?
[SpongeBob takes a bite of the Frozen Krabby Patty and doesn't like the taste of it. Then suddenly, without warning, he throws up sand and it forms into a sandcastle. SpongeBob then coughs up a toy shovel.]
SpongeBob: Sand?! It tastes like sand! Not good sand, either.
Squidward: Of course it does. What do you think Krabs uses as filler?
SpongeBob: Krabby Patties aren't made with sand! They're made with love.
[SpongeBob runs to the kitchen, retrieves his spatula, and kicks away the robot SpongeBob. He opens his body and takes out the real Krabby Patty formula. He opens the bottle, takes out the formula and reads it. His eyes glimmer with happiness.]
SpongeBob: Mm! I am going to show the world what a fresh, [puts Krusty Krab hat on] not frozen Krabby Patty tastes like, and the first one is for my best friend, Patrick.
[SpongeBob cooks the patty on the grill. As he cooks, depressed citizens with large butts smell the scent of the Krabby Patty being handmade by SpongeBob. Meanwhile, Patrick is getting interviews from the press with Don and Limia.]
Press: Over here. Right here, Patrick. Right here, right here. One, more, Patrick.
Agent: Patrick, baby, sweetheart, have you thought about that feature film I pitched youse?
[Patrick sadly looks at the picture of himself with SpongeBob until a camera man flashes in Patrick's eyes. Patrick is finally fed up with his popularity.]
Patrick: That's it! I can't take it anymore! Everybody out!
[Don, Limia, and the press leaves Patrick's hotel.]
Patrick: I wish things could go back to the way they were. Mm... [rubs his picture with his hand] I just wanna be able to share one pair of pants with my best friend without it being in the papers.
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob has finished his handmade Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Freshly grilled Krabby Patty, you and I are going to save the world. And save a friendship.
[Patrick sulks at the balcony when he sees SpongeBob running up to him.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob! [Patrick leaves the hotel and runs to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [through a bullhorn] Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!
Patrick: [Still running and not hearing,]SpongeBob, what?
SpongeBob: [through a cell phone] Patrick, the Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand!
Patrick: [through a telephone] I thought they tasted familiar!
[SpongeBob and Patrick soon crash into each other.]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob pulls himself off of Patrick and lands with a big hole in his face. He regenerates his face.]
SpongeBob: Missed you.
Patrick: I missed you too.
SpongeBob: [takes out the Krabby Patty he made himself] I got something for you, from one friend to another.
Patrick: No, no, I don't wanna eat another one of those things!
[SpongeBob stuffs his handmade Krabby Patty into Patrick's mouth. As he eats it, he begins to feel a sense of happiness. He flies around the air with joy.]
Patrick: Mm! Now that's a real Krabby Patty! Oh, as delicious as our real friendship.
SpongeBob: Now that we've saved our friendship, we have to save the reputation of the Krabby Patty.
Patrick: But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand? [kicks sand in SpongeBob's face]
[SpongeBob wipes the sand off his face.]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach.
[The scene changes to the shareholder meeting. Don and Mr. Krabs are on stage speaking to the audience.]
Don Grouper: Thank you, everyone, for coming to this gala event celebrating the meteoric success of Frozen Krabby Patties. In honor of this momentous occasion, we are going to premiere our 400th commercial.
Mr. Krabs: And here to say a few words is the face of the Frozen Krabby Patty, our own Patrick Star. Come on up, Patrick!
[The audience cheers and Patrick walks up to the speaker.]
Patrick: Good evening, ladies and... the other ones. I know you're all excited to see the 400th commercial, but before we see it, I just want to say...
[Patrick looks at SpongeBob, who gives him a thumbs up. Then he turns to the audience.]
Patrick: That...[looks at Don and Mr. Krabs] that...Frozen Krabby Patties are...
SpongeBob: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Patrick: ...Made with sand!
[The audience gasps in shock.]
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] Oh, no!
[Mr. Krabs faints in Don's arms again.]
Don Grouper: That was cute when you were rich. [drops Mr. Krabs and surrenders with his hands up guiltily] I'm out of here.
[Don leaves the stage as the audience vomit out sand. In doing so, their butts shrink down to their normal size. The scene changes to a graph of the Frozen Krabby Patty sales going down.]
Perch Perkins: And in shocking news today, it has been revealed that Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand.
[As everyone is watching the news, various people vomit out sand and their butts shrink back to normal. One of which vomits out palm trees. Another vomits out patty-shaped sand. Another vomits out sand shaped like a rectangular box. Another vomits sand through his eye sockets. Another vomits out sand with a snail in it. Then their butts begins to shrivel up afterwards. Not wanting to take this anymore, the customers decided once and for all to throw away all of the frozen patties they bought. Mr. Krabs is seen near a trashcan, depressed. The Krusty Factory is being closed down and pushed away by construction workers.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's gone. Everything I spent me life building is all gone. I'm ruined. [sobs] What?
[Mr. Krabs peeks into the Krusty Krab and sees customers eating the handmade Krabby Patties and are enjoying them.]
Harold: Now that's the taste I remember.
Mr. Krabs: That's strange.
[Mr. Krabs walks into the restaurant and sees all of the automatic robots being thrown out.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what is going on in here?
Squidward: Uh, [mechanical-like] I am Animatronic Squidward. I cannot answer questions.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward!
Squidward: [regular] It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are in the kitchen making Krabby Patties, sharing the same pants they wore in the beginning. Mr. Krabs walks in.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, did you do all this?
SpongeBob: Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped.
Patrick: A friend always helps. It's called "frelping," and I was very frelpful.
Mr. Krabs: But how did you get these customers to eat Krabby Patties? They know they're filled with sand.
SpongeBob: The frozen ones are, but these are made fresh.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Fresh?
SpongeBob: Go on, have a bite.
Mr. Krabs: No, no I—
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, just a nibble.
[SpongeBob spreads the patty on Mr. Krabs' face. Mr. Krabs takes a taste of the juice.]
Mr. Krabs: Here!
[Mr. Krabs nibbles on the fresh patty.]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor. [rubs his face] The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?
SpongeBob: Nothing, we're not selling them.
Patrick: Yeah, we just give them away.
Mr. Krabs: [freaks out] Agh, SpongeBob, me boy, you've done a good thing here, lad, but you could use a little frelp, I think. [jumps into the pants] How about we partner up, and I become your boss and pay you minimum wage while I work you mercilessly? What do you say?
SpongeBob: Yeah! The Krusty Krab is back in business!
Mr. Krabs: Great, now get back to work! [laughs]


[The episode begins at the Bikini Bottom Fair. SpongeBob and Patrick are chewing on some salt water taffy.]
SpongeBob: Mmm! Isn't this salt water taffy just tafflicious?
Patrick: Mmm! Stickerific!
[SpongeBob and Patrick continue chewing taffy. SpongeBob forms his taffy into guitar strings in his mouth and his tongue plays music with them. SpongeBob giggles. Patrick forms his taffy into a dog and the dog barks. SpongeBob stretches his taffy and makes a jump rope out of it. Patrick stretches his taffy and lassos some more taffy into his mouth.]
Patrick: Oww!
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Patrick?
Patrick: I have a headache inside of my tooth!
SpongeBob: Maybe you should do something about that.
Patrick: Okay, I will!
[Patrick runs off and SpongeBob hears Patrick screaming in pain. When he comes back, he has mouse traps all over his body.]
SpongeBob: How does that help?
Patrick: Well, now that my all over hurts, I'm not thinking about my mouth. [his mouth vibrates] Ow! I guess that didn't work!
[Patrick shakes the mouse traps off and they land on SpongeBob. SpongeBob jumps and shakes the traps off his body.]
SpongeBob: That's it! I'm taking you to the dentist, Patrick.
Patrick: No way! I've heard horror stories!
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Patrick. Dentists are our friends. [notices Patrick missing] Huh? Patrick? Patrick?
[SpongeBob looks around and sees Patrick trying to pose as a toy prize at a bottle toss stand.]
SpongeBob: Oh.
[SpongeBob goes to the bottle toss stand, pays the carnie a dollar, takes a ball, and wins the game.]
Carnie: And we have a winner.
[The carnie gives SpongeBob Patrick as a prize.]
SpongeBob: Thank you!
Patrick: Aww, darn it.
[SpongeBob carries Patrick away. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick at the dentist office.]
SpongeBob: Oh boy! Aren't dentist offices fun? [gasps] Oh, they've got colorful wooden beads on wires! [plays with the toy] Whoa, look at it go!
Patrick: Slow down, SpongeBob! This place is scary enough without you going crazy with the beads!
[Patrick grabs a magazine, blows dust off of it, and sees a picture of a fish from the 1700s with rotten teeth. He freaks out and throws the magazine away. He sees a tooth jack in the box break. He freaks out again. He gets even more frightened when he also sees a girl with braces and her teeth being held up by rubber bands and wires.]
Radio announcer: And that was the Incidentals with the startling number called Dramatic Music Stings. Coming up, here's the Spookers with the haunting little tune called Ominous.
Agnes: Patrick Star, we're ready for you now.
[Patrick hides under the sofa.]
SpongeBob: Aww, come on, Patrick. [pulls Patrick out] The doctor will fix you right up.
[SpongeBob drags Patrick.]
Agnes: Sit here, please. Dr. Mundane will be right with you.
[SpongeBob pulls Patrick to the dentist chair. Patrick begins to sweat as he sees a shadow looming in. Patrick freaks out and Dr. Mundane appears before him.]
Dr. Mundane: Agnes, please turn down that radio.
[Agnes turns off the radio and Dr. Mundane climbs up to his chair.]
Dr. Mundane: I'm Dr. Beige Mundane. You must be Patrick Star. What seems to be the problem?
Patrick: No problem. I was just leaving.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! Sit!
[SpongeBob grabs the rinser and sprays Patrick with water to make him sit.]
SpongeBob: Good boy. Ow!
[SpongeBob accidentally sprays himself with water. He laughs and wrings himself.]
Dr. Mundane: Let's take a look in your mouth. Open wide, please.
[Patrick opens his mouth and releases an awful odor. Dr. Mundane sees that one tooth is smaller than the rest and pokes it with his dental tools.]
Dr. Mundane: Mm-hmm. I see the problem. Your friend here still has a baby tooth.
SpongeBob: Oh, I wanna see!
[SpongeBob jumps on Patrick's chest and goes in his mouth. In Patrick's mouth, there is a sunken ship in his left cheek and bats fly into his throat. SpongeBob looks and sees Patrick's baby tooth wearing a blue cap sleeping in his jaw.]
SpongeBob: Aww. Coochie coo!
[Patrick's baby tooth cries and Patrick bites SpongeBob in half. He spits out the other half of SpongeBob and puts him back together. SpongeBob giggles.]
Patrick: I still have a baby tooth?
Dr. Mundane: Yes. [pulls down his x-ray and shows a bigger tooth trying to push the baby tooth out] And the pain is coming from your adult tooth trying to push your baby tooth out of the way.
Patrick: [gasps and pushes the x-ray away] That's not right!
Dr. Mundane: It's the natural way of things. [holds out some bigger pliers with sharp edges] If you want the pain to go away, then I need to extract the tooth.
[Dr. Mundane uses the bigger pliers to open the door and takes out smaller pliers to pull the baby tooth out.]
Patrick: You leave my baby tooth alone, you monster!
[Patrick runs away.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, come back!
[SpongeBob follows Patrick out of the dentist office.]
Patrick: Nobody's gonna tell me what to do with my baby tooth! This tooth is staying in my mouth!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. But that means your tooth won't be going to Tooth Island.
Patrick: Tooth Island?
SpongeBob: Yeah! Tooth Island! It's where the Tooth Fairy takes all the baby teeth that are left under pillows.
[SpongeBob images up an island with baby teeth swimming in calcium lakes, sleeping in gum trees and swinging on floss-like vines.]
SpongeBob: Tooth Island is a wonderful place where teeth can be free! They can soak in the calcium pools all day or sleep in the comfort of the pink gum trees. They get to swing on floss vines and never ever have to worry about cavities.
Baby teeth: Hey, come on over! Come on!
SpongeBob: Of course, I guess your baby tooth could be happy in your mouth all alone by itself.
[Patrick's baby tooth cries upon seeing how lonely it is.]
Patrick: I don't care, SpongeBob! I know what's best for my tooth! I can make it happy.
[Patrick walks off. The scene changes to nighttime at Patrick's house. Patrick is wearing a bathrobe, has hair on his face, and has hair curlers on his head. Patrick is still suffering pain in his mouth as rubs his cheek and his baby tooth continues to cry. Patrick moves his jaw back and forth.]
Patrick: ♪Rock a bye baby on the treetop♪
[Nothing helps. He grabs some keys and jingles with them. The baby tooth stops crying and giggles at the keys. Patrick accidentally drops the keys.]
Patrick: Oops.
[The keys hit the baby tooth's head and it goes back to crying. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab. Patrick is eating a Krabby Patty. But as he chews, he continues to feel pain in his mouth.]
Patrick: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
[SpongeBob, who is at the grill making Krabby Patties, hears Patrick screaming.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. My friendship sense is tingling. Patrick must be in trouble.
[Patrick moans in pain.]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, pal?
Patrick: [swallows] Nothing! Just, uh, practicing being a seal! [laughs]
[Patrick claps and barks like a seal. Craig Mammalton is offended by Patrick's stupidity and angrily walks off.]
Patrick: Ow!
SpongeBob: Patrick, Dr. Mundane always says, "If you can't bite, things ain't right."
Patrick: Okay, SpongeBob. I guess I have to get my tooth to the Tooth Fairy.
Squidward: Ha! You rube. There's no such thing as a Tooth Fairy.
[SpongeBob and Patrick gasps]
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: It's all a bunch of made-up baloney.
SpongeBob: It is not baloney!
Squidward: It is baloney!
Patrick: Who's got baloney?
Squidward: [groans] There is no baloney! Just like there is no Tooth Fairy. In fact, if you could prove there were a Tooth Fairy, I would eat, oh, a bucket of chum!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Eew!
SpongeBob: Squidward, why would you want to do that?
Squidward: I said I would, only if there was a Tooth Fairy, and since there isn't a Tooth Fairy, I will never have to eat a bucket of chum.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I've been your friend for a long time. I would never lie to you. You need Dr. Mundane's help so you could get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy.
Patrick: That's okay, SpongeBob. I think I can manage.
[Patrick takes out a blender, grinds a Krabby Patty into a smoothie, puts a tiny umbrella and a straw in it, and drinks it through his nose. As he swallows it, a drip of the smoothie falls on his baby tooth and it starts crying again. Patrick cries in pain and falls to the floor.]
SpongeBob: You see, Patrick? We have got to get that tooth out.
Patrick: You'll have to catch me first!
[Patrick runs away.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait!
[SpongeBob chases Patrick. But in doing so, he jumps on the barrel and begins rolling in place with it.]
Squidward: Ha, ha! Tooth Fairy! What a couple of molar morons!
[SpongeBob kicks the barrel in Squidward's face and resumes chasing Patrick. Patrick is running down the road. SpongeBob, with some help from two worms, chases Patrick like a cowboy chasing a rustler. SpongeBob takes off his glasses and looks around for Patrick.]
Patrick: The worms!
[Patrick runs through a grassy field. SpongeBob and the worms plow through the field. Patrick jumps over a wire fence. SpongeBob and the worms break through the fence. Patrick stops at a lake, grabs a bamboo stick for a snorkel, jumps in the lake, and sucks water in his body. SpongeBob and the worms stop and look for Patrick. The worms spot Patrick at the lake and Patrick spits water at them, which makes him flying into a tree. On the tree is a wanted sign with Patrick's picture on it. Patrick takes a pencil and writes on the sign.]
Patrick: Not wanted. That fixes it.
[Patrick sees SpongeBob and the worms catching up to him and frantically climbs up the tree. The worms jump up and down to try to reach Patrick. The worms turn out to be smaller worms.]
Old Lady: Mipsey, Pipsey, you bad girls! You get back on this leash!
[The two worms go back on the leash and the old lady walks off.]
Patrick: You may have called off your worms, but I'm not coming down!
SpongeBob: Patrick, they weren't mine.
Patrick: A likely story!
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick, can I show you something?
[SpongeBob climbs up the tree and pulls out a scrapbook.]
Patrick: What's that?
SpongeBob: It's a scrapbook of all my baby teeth. [shows a picture of himself with his baby tooth] Ha. That was a good one. I remember every tooth. Even though they're no longer in my mouth, I still keep the memory of them in my heart.
Patrick: [laughs] I thought you kept them in the scrapbook!
SpongeBob: Patrick, don't you think your baby tooth wants to see all his old friends on Tooth Island?
Old Lady: Don't listen to him! I still have all my baby teeth and look at me!
[The old lady shows them her teeth and they look incredibly hideous. SpongeBob and Patrick freak out.]
Patrick: Okay, SpongeBob. We can go.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick at the dentist office again.]
Patrick: I'm ready, Doc. Do what you have to do.
[Dr. Mundane extracts Patrick's baby tooth from his mouth with the pliers.]
Dr. Mundane: I'm done.
Patrick: That's it?
Dr. Mundane: That's it.
[Dr. Mundane gives Patrick his baby tooth which is wrapped in a blanket. His baby tooth is now happy.]
Patrick: You're going under my pillow so you can go to Tooth Island my sweet boy!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob opening Patrick's house open. Patrick is sleeping while his baby tooth is under his pillow. SpongeBob attempts to take the tooth until a light appears and Patrick wakes up.]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
Squidward: [holding a spotlight] Ha! I was right! The Tooth Fairy isn't real!
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you don't understand! I'm just helping to get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy!
Squidward: Oh, that's a good one.
SpongeBob: It's true!
Patrick: How can I believe you? All the lies! [holds out his dictionary] The chicanery! [cries]
Squidward: [laughs] Look at how betrayed Patrick feels! Oh, this was totally worth staying up all night.
SpongeBob: You don't believe there's a Tooth Fairy? Well, follow me and I'll show ya.
[SpongeBob takes Patrick and Squidward to the docks.]
SpongeBob: Behold, the Tooth Ferry!
[The "Tooth Fairy" turns out to be a huge ferry with teeth decorations and the words "Tooth Ferry" on the bow. Several people are tearing up as they say good-bye to their baby teeth as they go on the boat.]
SpongeBob: This is where parents and friends take teeth so they can be ferried to Tooth Island.
Patrick: There really is a Tooth Ferry!
SpongeBob: Of course.
[Squidward drops his jaw in surprise and his eyeballs fall on his tongue.]
Ferry Worker: All aboard!
[The ferry worker directs the teeth onto the boat. Patrick's baby tooth waves at Patrick before leaving.]
Baby Tooth: [giggles] Hello!
[Patrick sheds tears of joy and the Tooth Ferry blows dollars out of the horns as it departs for Tooth Island. The crowd cheers as they get money from the Tooth Ferry and wave good-bye to their teeth. SpongeBob catches a dollar.]
SpongeBob: Oh, here. This is yours.
Patrick: Could you wait 'til I'm asleep and put it under my pillow?
SpongeBob: Mm, sure Patrick. Anything for a pal.
[SpongeBob puts the dollar in his pocket. Squidward, who is shocked at the sudden revelation, tries to run away.]
Patrick: Hey! Where do you think you're going, chum chewer?
[Patrick grabs Squidward and holds him up. Patrick and SpongeBob are now angry at Squidward for what he tried to do.]
Squidward: Hey, come on! This is just a big misunderstanding! Ferry, fairy: They're two different words that just happen to sound alike!
[SpongeBob holds up a bucket of chum meat.]
SpongeBob: Open wide, Squidward!
Squidward: No.
[Squidward's teeth scream and they jump out of his mouth. Squidward's teeth go into the water and swim towards the Tooth Ferry, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Patrick are hitting a plastic cup with a stick, feeling bored.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Your turn. [gives Patrick the stick]
[Patrick hits the cup with the stick.]
Patrick: Now you. [gives SpongeBob the stick]
[SpongeBob hits the cup with the stick.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: [sighs] Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Do you think it will make the game more exciting if we played it with... [holds out two sticks] two sticks?
[Patrick's head buffs up and snatches the sticks from SpongeBob's hands.]
Patrick: Two sticks?! That's against the rules! You can't change the rules, SpongeBob, just because I'm winning!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick. I'm just so bored playing "Stick in a Cup."
Nathiel Waters: [on television] Are you tired of playing with an old stick and a cup?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [turn their heads to the TV] Yeah.
Nathiel Waters: [on television] Well, say goodbye to boring and hello to whirly brains! The exciting new toy that puts you in the driver's seat of your own mind! It's so simple! Just flip your lid, attach the propeller, and watch your brain soar hundreds of feet into the air as you control the action!
[SpongeBob and Patrick get very excited about the advertisement on TV and their eyes were put in a trance. Two fishing poles dragged them to the screen.]
Nathiel Waters: Get your whirly brain today and free your mind!
SpongeBob: Free my mind! Free my mind! Free my mind! [chews on a stick]
[Patrick chews on a cup. Both SpongeBob and Patrick grab to television and started doing a tug-of-war with it.]
SpongeBob: I want it!
Patrick: No, I want it!
SpongeBob: No, I want it!
Patrick: No, I want it!
SpongeBob: No, it's mine!
Patrick: I want it! I want it!
SpongeBob: No, it's mine!
[They pulled so hard that they accidentally break the television into pieces.]
Patrick: Sorry to hear about your TV, SpongeBob.
[They put the television back together and it turns on.]
Nathiel Waters: [on television] Whirly brains available now at Bikini Bottom Toy Shop.
[They put the television down and start dancing around.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whirly brains! Whirly brains! Whirly brains! Whirly brains! Whirly brains!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob opening the Whirly Brainbox and taking out the propeller. SpongeBob climbs up on Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. Just let me flip your lid so I can attach the propeller directly to your brain.
[SpongeBob tries to open Patrick's head, but failed as it gets out of shape. SpongeBob slides down and Patrick straightens out his face. SpongeBob reads the instruction paper.]
SpongeBob: Step one... [reads] Oh, I see what to do.
[SpongeBob pulls out a monster mask, puts it on and scares Patrick out of his wits. Patrick's head opens up.]
SpongeBob: [takes off mask] It's just me, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh! [sighs]
[SpongeBob attaches the propeller on Patrick's brain and gives Patrick the mask.]
SpongeBob: Now, you do me!
[Patrick puts on the mask.]
Patrick: Boo!
[SpongeBob screams as his head opens up. Patrick attaches the propeller on SpongeBob's brain and takes off the mask. SpongeBob takes out the remote controls and gives one to Patrick.]
SpongeBob: It's time to free our minds!
[SpongeBob and Patrick activate the remotes and their brains slowly exit their heads with their eyeballs attached, leaving their bodies blind. Their whirly brains then fly around the air.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick! I've never seen the world from this angle before!
Patrick: [laughs] And the propeller tickles my think folds! [laughs] Hey, hey, hey, SpongeBob! Eye bump!
SpongeBob: Eye bump!
[SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains crash into each other and injuries their eyes.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, no more eye bumps. Okay?
Patrick: [rubs his eye hole] I feel you.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains fly around SpongeBob's house. The whirly brains fly through the chimney and come out through the sink faucet. SpongeBob's whirly brain flies around the kitchen to look for Patrick's whirly brain. Patrick's whirly brain, who is in the freezer, sneaks up on SpongeBob's whirly brain and pulls it in. The two whirly brains fight each other inside, which makes the refrigerator bounce around the house and sends it crashing outside. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as their whirly brains feel dizzy.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whirly freeze!
[SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains fly through a bush and makes a SpongeBob and Patrick-shaped topiary. Patrick's whirly brain slices the pineapple peel off of SpongeBob's house, revealing Gary doing his business in his litter box. Gary hides himself in the curtain. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. I know who we can spy on. [laughs]
[Squidward is in his bathtub.]
Squidward: [sighs] The sanctity of my bathroom. The only place in the world where I can... [unravels his nose] let it all hang out. [sighs] Me... [sinks into his tub and rests]
[SpongeBob and Patrick whirly brains peek inside Squidward's bathroom.]
SpongeBob: Hey, where's Squidward? I'm sure I saw him in here.
[SpongeBob's whirly brain flies in and lays on Squidward's head.]
Patrick: Well, maybe he fell in the toilet. I'll check!
[Patrick's whirly brain flies into Squidward's toilet.]
Patrick: Squidward, are you in here? Did you fall in? Squidward!
[Squidward wakes up.]
Squidward: Stop serenading me, you sap! It's my day off! Now, go away!
[Squidward takes out a mirror and looks at his reflection. But to his horrifying surprise, he sees SpongeBob's whirly brain on his head and freaks out.]
SpongeBob: Found him!
[Patrick's whirly brain flies out of Squidward's toilet.]
Patrick: Yep, that's him! Hi, Squidward!
[Squidward is freaked out.]
Squidward: Aliens from Mars! It's an invasion!
[Squidward jumps out the window and lands flat on his face in the ground. He gets up and frantically runs around, naked. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick flying their whirly brains around until they sliced their heads. The heads fall on the wrong bodies.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whirly brains are go!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains switching Perry and Evelyn's cups at the Le Café. They both drink the wrong cups until they spit in each other's faces. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: She spit in his face! [laughs]
[The scene changes Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs going on a date. SpongeBob and Patrick both spy on them with their whirly brains.]
Mr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff, we've been dating for 16 years now. So, I was sincerely hoping that today might finally be the day that...
Mrs. Puff: Yes, Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Can I steal a little kiss?
Mrs. Puff: Oh! [laughs] Oh, Eugene! I thought you'd never ask.
[SpongeBob turns the brain gas lever on the remote.]
Mr. Krabs: Come here, you.
[As Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs are about to share a kiss, SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains pass gas, which causes Mrs. Puff to inflate herself.]
Mr. Krabs: What a woman!
Mrs. Puff: [blushes] Oh, Eugene!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains flying around, creating a whirly brain-shaped cloud with the gas. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh until someone throws eggs in their faces.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: What was that?
[Right in front of SpongeBob and Patrick was a kid who also has a whirly brain. But he is using it to bully people like throwing eggs.]
Kid: Oh, that smarts! [laughs] Bullseye!
Patrick: I thought we were the first kids on the block to get whirly brains!
Kid: What are you? Thick? Every kid in town's got a whirly brain! [spits]
[Numerous whirly brains fly around SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains.]
Buddy: Daddy, daddy! Can I have a whirly brain too?
Fred: Absolutely not, son. Your brain is your body's most important organ, not a toy.
[Buddy cries while a whirly brain flies towards Fred and hits him. Buddy laughs.]
SpongeBob: Hooray! Now, we can play whirly brains with the whole neighborhood! Hey, kid! Race ya to the end of the street!
Kid: Eat my brainstem slowpoke!
[The three whirly brains take their positions for their race.]
Patrick: Get ready, get set, punch it!
[The three whirly brains fly through the air at fast speed. The kid's whirly brain spit out gas to blind SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains. SpongeBob and Patrick cough and continue to fly. The kid's whirly brain laughs as he is beating them. But unfortunately, the kid's whirly brain ended up flying into Bubble Bass's butt. SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains fly past Bubble Bass.]
SpongeBob: Yes! We're gonna beat him, Patrick! We're gonna win!
[SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains continue flying until suddenly, they get hit by someone's can and fell on the ground. The cane belonged to a grouchy old man who thought kids were invading his property with toys.]
Angry Old Timer: Play your toys into my yard, will ya? Well, they're mine now!
[The old man takes SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains inside his house and stores them into a barrel where he keeps the other whirly brains in. He wraps a sheet over the barrel so they won't fly out.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what's going on? Everything went dark! Uh, Patrick, can you see anything?
Patrick: Only the dismal abyss of black nothingness. [his eyeholes widen]
SpongeBob: Aw, our remote controls are dead too! Oh, Patrick, I don't want to jump to any conclusions here, but I think that we have lost our minds!
Patrick: [laughs] M-O-O-N. [laughs] That spells moon! [laughs hysterically]
SpongeBob: Okay, don't panic, Patrick. We'll find them. Just take it easy. Take it easy! PATRICK, TAKE IT EASY!
Patrick: I'm taking it easy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Our brains are probably right around here somewhere. Uh, here brains! Brains! Here, boy! [stutters]
Patrick: Here, brains!
[SpongeBob and Patrick look for their whirly brains. SpongeBob touches Nazz who is holding her baby.]
SpongeBob: Brainy, where are you?
[Patrick touches Officer John.]
Patrick: Brain, brain, brain! I think I found it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I've found mine too!
[SpongeBob has the baby on his head with its feet sticking out of his eye holes while Patrick has a fire hydrant on his head.]
SpongeBob: Oh, darn it. I still can't see.
Patrick: Yeah, my brain won't fit back in.
[Patrick hits the fire hydrant with a hammer. Nazz takes her baby out of SpongeBob's head, leaving its stinky diaper behind.]
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, ma'am, you forgot something.
Nazz: That's okay. You can keep it. [she leaves]
Patrick: I'll take it!
[Patrick takes the smelly diaper and puts it in his head. He closes his head and marks dots on it to make it look like eyes.]
Patrick: Oh, yeah! Lookin' good!
SpongeBob: Ew! Give me that!
[SpongeBob kicks open Patrick's head and throws away the smelly diaper.]
Patrick: Aww, man! That felt all squishy! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Patrick, we need help. Let's call Sandy.
Patrick: Okay. Sandy!
SpongeBob: [takes out phone] Patrick, I meant on the phone.
[SpongeBob dials the number and calls Sandy.]
Sandy: [on phone] Hello?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sandy!
[The scene changes to Sandy using her brain detector while SpongeBob and Patrick are tied to a rope so they won't get lost.]
Sandy: Dang. You two sure are lucky that I created this brain detector last summer. I was beginning to think I'd never use this thing.
SpongeBob: Oh, I hope we find our brains soon. They're probably cold and hungry by now. Poor things.
[Soon, everyone in town is looking for their missing whirly brains and as they look, they end up crashing into each other.]
Sandy: And it looks like you're not the only critters around these parks to lose your minds. [looks at her detector] Hmm... And my detector is leading us directly to that house.
[The old man who stole SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains is sleeping on his rocking chair on the porch.]
Sandy: Excuse me, kind sir. Would you mind too terribly if we just came in your house for a minute and looked around for my friend's missin' brains?
[The old man is still sleeping.]
Sandy: We're gonna take that as a yes. Step lively, fellas!
[Sandy, SpongeBob and Patrick enter the old man's house.]
Sandy: This place has a ten-gallon case of the creepies. I wonder what's in...
[Sandy takes a peek inside the barrel.]
Sandy: [gasps] Hey, fellas! I think I've found your brains!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
[SpongeBob and Patrick jump in excitement but accidentally creaks the floor.]
Angry Old Timer: [offscreen] Hey!
SpongeBob, Sandy and Patrick: Huh?
Angry Old Timer: What are you sneak thieves doing into my house? Them brains violated my air space and I'm keepin' them! I'm callin' the cops!
[SpongeBob and Patrick pleads the old man not to call the police, crying.]
Sandy: Sorry nothin'! Look, Old Timer, one false move and I'll be on you like a horsefly on a cracker barrel!
Angry Old Timer: Bring it on, Slimmy Whiskers! All twenty-threes can do your bees knees with one nickel, sister!
Sandy: Alright! Now you listen to me, you twisted coot! You can't steal somebody's brain just because it flies into your yard! That's brain-napping! And it looks like I'll be the one callin' the police!
SpongeBob: Oh, I love it when Sandy gets aggressive. Let's give her some room.
[SpongeBob and Patrick back up but they both trip over the barrel and frees the whirly brains the old man stole. The whirly brains fly out of the old man's house and heads back to town to find their owners. Some of the whirly brains ring the doorbells.]
Fred: Oh, Brainy, you're back!
[Everyone cheers as their whirly brains have been returned. SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains fly back into their heads. SpongeBob and Patrick remove the propellers from their brains and close their heads, returning to normal.]
SpongeBob: Whew! I'll never be a no-brainer again! [laughs]
Sandy: Everyone has their brains back, so I'm a let it go this time. But if you steal as much as a beach ball, so help me I'll...
Angry Old Timer: [cries] I'm sorry, Squirrel Lady! I just couldn't take watching all the kids have fun in the air while I'm stuck here with this crotchety cane on the ground!
SpongeBob and Sandy: Aww!
Sandy: Well, I think we've got a cure for what ails you. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Sandy: I think I'm thinkin' what you're thinkin'.
SpongeBob: Patrick?
[Patrick is pulling his head with a plunger.]
Patrick: My think is clogged.
[The scene changes to the old man flying through the air with the whirly brain propellers and is having a lot of fun.]
Sandy: Sure was nice of you two to donate your whirly brains to the old timer. You fellas did a good deed today.
SpongeBob: Oh, no need to thank us, Sandy. If we can just make one angry old man happy, that and itself is thanks enough. The dignity of the elderly was the victor here today.
[The old man flies above several old people at Shady Shoals Resting Home.]
Angry Old Timer: [laughs] Look out my dears below! Take a ride on the love copter!
[Squidward, who is still naked, runs past Shady Shoals Resting Home.]
Squidward: The Martians are coming! Run for your lives! You're next! You're next!


[The episode begins with Squidward walking along the street]
Squidward: Maybe I'll do a cute little button. [Pulls his nose to give himself a button-nose. His nose pops out suddenly.] Or something a bit more manly perhaps. [pulls his nose hairs to create a mustache and a humanoid nose. His nose pops out back to normal suddenly] Upturned might be good, too. [Breathes in, puts his thumb into his mouth, and then blows. He gets an upturned nose. Just then, SpongeBob appears in his unicycle.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Great. [slaps himself] The idiot found me.
SpongeBob: Whatcha doing?
Squidward: I'm picking a nose.
SpongeBob: Ooh! I used to pick my nose too, until I finally cleared it out.
[SpongeBob lifts his nose and sticks his hand in it.]
Squidward: I'm not picking my nose, SpongeBob. I'm on the way to the hospital for a nose job. Plastic surgery. I'm finally gonna get the nose I should have been born with.
SpongeBob: [gasps] But, Squidward, you're a beautiful flower. You don't need to change a... [freaks out when he sees how hideously disgusting Squidward's nose is up close] Well, maybe a little work wouldn't hurt. Hey, you want a ride?
Squidward: With you? Absolutely not.
SpongeBob: Aww, come on, Squidward. [pedals off and comes back with a trashcan attached to his unicycle] I can get you there lickety-split.
[SpongeBob stuffs Squidward into the trashcan. Then he puts on a siren and pedals to the hospital at a fast pace, causing them to crash into the check-in desk.]
Nurse: You can't dump your garbage here, sir.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not garbage. That's my friend, Squidward. We're here to check in.
[SpongeBob removes the trashcan off of Squidward and his nose is covered with garbage.]
Nurse: Holy nostroly! You must be here for the nose job. Let's, uh, get your paperwork filled out.
[The scene changes to Squidward hooked up to the IV.]
Surgeon: You just relax, sir. The doctor will be ready for you soon.
Squidward: [inhales deeply] Ah. This is nice.
SpongeBob: Never fear, Squidward. Soon this dreary old room will be so full of well-wishing you'll never want to go home.
French Narrator: Five minutes later...
[Squidward's room is filled with balloons, teddy bears and get well cards.]
Squidward: [grunts as he pops out of his pile of teddy bears] SpongeBob, get this garbage out of here! I can hardly move!
SpongeBob: Oh, are you uncomfortable? Here, let me help.
[SpongeBob pushes the bed's buttons and the bed folds Squidward into the mattress. It also made Squidward get stuck into a teddy bear.]
Teddy Bear: I love you.
Squidward: [grunts as he rips the teddy off of him] The bed is fine!
SpongeBob: Fluff your pillow?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Fluff your IV bag?
[SpongeBob fluffs the IV bag, which makes Squidward's head buff up and down.]
Squidward: Enough, you buffoon!
SpongeBob: Well, gee, Squidward, I was just trying to be helpful.
Squidward: [sighs] If you want to help so badly, why don't you just go volunteer to be a candy striper? There's plenty of other people in the hospital you could torture.
SpongeBob: Squidward, that's a great idea. I was born to serve.
[SpongeBob runs out of the room. Squidward's bed folds up again.]
SpongeBob: Hello, lady, can I be a candy striper here at the—
Nurse: Grab a uniform out of the closet.
SpongeBob: Ooh, thank you! Thank you! Whoo! [runs into the closet and comes back out with a uniform] Ooh! Candy stripes. [slurps on the strips] Strawberry.
Purple Doctor: Ah, Doctor, thank goodness you're here.
Green Doctor: We were just looking for another physician to join us on our rounds.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and the doctors at a patient's room.]
Green Doctor: And what seems to be the problem today?
Catfish: [coughing] My throat hurts.
Purple Doctor: Prescribe him a numbing throat spray. Let's move on, shall we?
SpongeBob: Wait a second! I think I've seen this before. [rubs his finger all over the catfish and abstracts some filth] Mm, yeah. [licks the filth] Mm-hmm. I'll need one medical sea-chicken.
[The purple doctor takes a sea-chicken out of the first aid kit. SpongeBob plucks one of the feathers of the chicken, making it cluck in pain and places the chicken on the window but it falls down. SpongeBob tickles the catfish with the feather, which makes him cough up his keys.]
Catfish: Hey, my keys. And my throat feels better.
SpongeBob: You see, doctors, catfish are bottom feeders. The dirt on his face led me to believe he had recently eaten something that irritated his throat. Happens to my friend Patrick all the time. [grunts as he pulls out a pen, pencil and paintbrush from his head] Mm-hmm. [picks a pen and writes something down on a paper] Try a Krabby Patty next time, sir. They go down smooth, and they taste better than car keys.
Catfish: Thanks, doc.
SpongeBob: No need to thank me, sir. I'm here to help.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and the doctors at another patient's room.]
Purple Doctor: What treatment might you prescribe for this next patient, Doctor?
[The green doctor shows SpongeBob the x-ray of the patient's broken legs.]
Runner: So what do you think? Will I be able to run in the Bikini Bottom marathon next week?
Green Doctor: Oh, my, no. I'm afraid you're—
SpongeBob: Of course! Friends don't let friends miss marathons. We'll have you up in no time. [looks around and sees a skeleton] Ah!
[SpongeBob grabs the skeleton and lifts up the runner.]
Runner: What are you—
[SpongeBob shakes the broken bones out of the runner's body and stuffs the skeleton inside him.]
Purple Doctor: Most unorthodox.
Green Doctor: He's a genius.
[The runner appears to be good as new. Except that his head and feet are facing the wrong direction.]
Runner: Thanks, doc.
SpongeBob: Ready, set. [blows blowhorn as the runner runs out backwards]
[The scene changes to the doctors talking to Mrs. Puff hooked up to the iron lung.]
Green Doctor: And what seems to be your problem today, ma'am?
Mrs. Puff: Sometimes, I just don't have it in me to puff up under my own power.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: No! Not you! [whimpers] What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: [whispers] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'm a doctor...today. What is this crazy thing? Looks like some sort of weird submarine. [climbs through the iron lung]
Purple Doctor: You're kidding of course. We've placed her in an iron lung to help puff her back up.
SpongeBob: Ha-ha! Dive! Dive! Up periscope! Load the torpedoes. [imitates airplane]
Mrs. Puff: Huh?
[SpongeBob laughs but accidentally kicks the lever, making the iron lung move.]
Mrs. Puff: [whispers] Help me! [screams]
[The iron lung rolls down the hallway.]
Unnamed doctor: Hey!
[All the doctors and patients panic as the iron lung rolls through the hall, crashing into several people, including the runner in the process.]
Runner: My legs!
SpongeBob: Never fear, Mrs. Puff. I haven't lost a patient all day. [puts on medical goggles] Let's get medical.
[SpongeBob drives the iron lung with the levers, making Mrs. Puff get her puff back in shape. SpongeBob screams as he notices that he is about to crash into the windows. He tries to slow the machine down, but breaks the levers.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no.
[The iron lung crashes into the two windows, pushing Mrs. Puff out. Mrs. Puff inflates as her puff is now fully back in shape.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh. Actually, I feel like my old self again. But you still don't get a driver's license. [shrinks down to normal size and falls to the ground] Oh!
Purple Doctor: Wow. I've never seen anyone work an iron lung like that.
Green Doctor: So awesome.
[The two doctors high-five.]
Purple Doctor: We were on our way to perform a surgery...
Green Doctor: But we would be honored to watch you perform it.
SpongeBob: Me? Perform a surgery?
[Meanwhile at the operation theater, Squidward is getting ready for his nose job.]
Squidward: Oh, yeah, this is the life. And best of all, there's no SpongeBob here to ruin it.
[The two doctors and SpongeBob arrive in the operation theater.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy, surgery! And on my first day too.
Squidward: SpongeBob? No! What are you doing here?
Surgeon: Nighty night, Mr. Tentacles.
Squidward: Wait, wait, no, no, no, no!
[The surgeon puts Squidward to sleep with anesthesia.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, everybody.
Doctors and surgeons: Hi, SpongeBob.
Purple Doctor: Doctor, the patient's over here, and he's ready for you to begin.
Green Doctor: Oh, we're most eager to see which tool you select first.
SpongeBob: [looks for a tool] Hmm, mm—mm—mm—mm. Let me see. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Phew. [picks up a spatula] Here we go!
[SpongeBob twirls his spatula around for a few moments, impressing the doctors and surgeons.]
Doctors and surgeons: Oh! Ah!
[SpongeBob goes to do Squidward's nose job.]
SpongeBob: Okay, SpongeBob, this can't be too hard. Just make an incision here, and— [operates with the spatula and ink sprays up] no! Shoot! [the heart flips] Son of a gun! [continues to work, but breaks Squidward's foot off] Ah, my bad.
Surgeon: I'll take that. [takes the foot]
SpongeBob: Ah-ha! [chops with spatula and makes sushi] Mmm, sushi.
[The surgeon takes the sushi and SpongeBob pulls out a saw. SpongeBob performs the operation with a saw, but breaks it. SpongeBob gets creeped out when he notices that he just sawed Squidward in half. The surgeon moves Squidward's head to another bed where the rest of his body is being placed.]
SpongeBob: He's, uh, really going to pieces over this nose job.
[The doctors and surgeons laugh.]
SpongeBob: Oh, [chuckles] Thank you! Let's try again, shall we?
[SpongeBob resumes the operation and creates a patty with Squidward's tentacle in it.]
SpongeBob: Order up!
[The doctors and surgeons applaud and laugh. SpongeBob hops onto Squidward's bed and lifts his nose up. In the nostril, there's a blue ribbon in it.]
SpongeBob: Yow! That shouldn't be in there. [pulls ribbon and sees another one] Ooh! [pulls more ribbons out and a clipboard]
Yellow Doctor: What? [notices his clipboard is missing] Oh.
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[The doctors and surgeons applaud. SpongeBob is seen stitching Squidward's nose together.]
SpongeBob: Nurse, sponge.
[The surgeon clips part of SpongeBob's head and wipe the sweat off. The sponge jumps back into the place it was clipped off.]
SpongeBob: Thank you, nurse.
Gray Doctor: I can't see! I can't see! I want to see!
[The gray doctor jumps out of the window and falls into Squidward's nose.]
Gray Doctor: I still can't see.
[The gray doctor runs around to operating room, dragging Squidward all over the place. SpongeBob stops the gray doctor from running around and sends him flying back into the balcony with the spatula. The pink doctor catches the gray doctor with a catcher's mitt.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[The doctors and surgeons applaud. SpongeBob resumes the operation and gives the finishing touches.]
SpongeBob: There we go. You can wake him up now, nurse.
Squidward: [wakes up and groans] What—what happened?
SpongeBob: I finished your nose job, you silly goose. Take a look.
[SpongeBob pulls out a mirror and Squidward looks at his reflection. His nose appears to be bigger than it was before.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you idiot! This isn't even close to what I wanted!
SpongeBob: Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, nurse!
Squidward: Wait, no, no, no! I want a different doctor! I—
[The surgeon puts Squidward to sleep with anesthesia again. He wakes up again and looks at his reflection again. He has three noses instead of one.]
Squidward: No! [with a noisemaker] No! [with an elephant's trunk] No! [with clarinet] No! [with crabs nose] No! [with log] No! [with the face of Squilliam Fancyson] No! [with a reindeer's head] No! [with his house] No! [with real life octopus] No! [with car engine and it flares up] No-o-o-o! [sobbing]
[SpongeBob snaps his fingers. Squidward wakes up for the final time.]
Squidward: Stop! I don't want to change my nose anymore! SpongeBob, I'll do anything! Anything at—
SpongeBob: How's about the Squidward Classic?
[SpongeBob holds up the mirror and Squidward's nose is back to how it was.]
Squidward: Hey, not bad. This looks even better than my old nose.
SpongeBob: Well, I did have to use a few of your other body parts to re-sculpt it.
[Squidward appears to be missing his arms and legs.]
SpongeBob: D'oh! Look at the time. I have to go to work. [takes off his surgery outfit]
Purple Doctor: But you're a doctor. You're at work.
SpongeBob: No, I'm just a fry cook. [puts on Krusty Krab hat] But it was fun playing with you guys. Bye! [leaves]
Purple Doctor: Fry cook? Ooh. [faints in the green doctor's arms]
Squidward: Don't be afraid, ladies. This sinus Adonis is on the market.
[The two surgeons gasp and shiver.]


[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house during the night. As SpongeBob and Gary are asleep, a worm appears at the window. The worm ties himself with a rope and shoots an arrow at SpongeBob's diving board. He dangles over SpongeBob and looks down at his holes. He cuts the rope with his teeth and parachutes into SpongeBob's hole, which immediately wakes SpongeBob up.]
SpongeBob: Hi. [looks up] Gary, I feel funny inside.
[Gary is still sleeping. SpongeBob digs his finger into one of his holes. The worm bites his finger.]
SpongeBob: Yow!
[SpongeBob looks inside his body and sees the worm.]
SpongeBob: Hello.
[The worm shivers.]
SpongeBob: Gary, there's something inside of me.
Gary: [wakes up] Meow.
SpongeBob: You see anything?
[Gary peeks inside SpongeBob's hole and sees the worm. He screeches and his eyestalks fly around inside SpongeBob's body. He catches the worm and struggles to pull him out. SpongeBob pulls Gary's eyestalks out of his body.]
SpongeBob: Gary the Snail, is that any way to treat an uninvited guest?
[The worm pops out.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello.
[The worm goes back in SpongeBob's body.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! That tickles! More like prickles. Hey, I think I'll call you Prickles!
[Prickles hides in SpongeBob's body and pops out in another hole.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] I see you!
[Prickles continuously goes in and out of SpongeBob's holes.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay, okay. Enough's enough. It's time for you to go, little guy. I already have a pet—Gary. I'm afraid I just don't need another one.
[SpongeBob tries to blow Prickles out of his body, but it doesn't work. He does it numerous times, but Prickles still wants to stay inside SpongeBob. SpongeBob runs out of breath and Prickles begins to cry.]
SpongeBob: Aw, stop, stop! Oh, Gary, I don't want to hear the little guy cry.
Gary: Meow.
[Prickles pops out and babbles his story to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [teary eyed] Such a sad story.
[Prickles babbles about staying for one night.]
SpongeBob: Okay, little buddy, but just for one night.
[Prickles kisses SpongeBob and goes back inside. SpongeBob gives Prickles a blanket.]
SpongeBob: Nighty-night, Prickles.
[SpongeBob and Gary go back to sleep. But as they sleep, Prickles wakes up and signals an airplane inside SpongeBob's house. The airplane drops off more worms and the worms parachute inside SpongeBob's body.]
SpongeBob: Huh?
[SpongeBob wakes up and sees Prickles and his worm friends disco dancing inside his body. Two worms are flashing lights with the music, the other two worms are blowing through their noisemakers, another is juggling fire clubs, and a clown worm is riding through the holes on a bicycle. As they continue to party, SpongeBob bounces along with the music.]
SpongeBob: Wow, a house party going on inside of me! Hey, why wasn't I invited? [laughs] I guess I was since I am the house! Look, Gary, now we have tons of prickly new friends! [shows Gary the worms]
Gary: [annoyed] Meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!
French Narrator: 3,000 Wup-poos later...
SpongeBob: Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! [babbling and humming]
[Gary slithers to the window and pulls the shades up. It is morning outside.]
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! I completely lost all track of time! Hey, uh, sorry to be a party pooper, guys, but I've gotta take a shower and get ready for work.
[But the worms are too distracted by the music and continue to dance.]
SpongeBob: Guys? Guy—guys?
[Gary growls at the worms and pushes SpongeBob with his eyestalks.]
SpongeBob: Gary, calm down. We're all friends here.
[One worm blows a raspberry at Gary. Gary has had enough with the worms and pushes SpongeBob out of his house.]
SpongeBob: Ow! [gasps and pulls his underwear up] Open up, Gary! I'm still in my underwear!
[Gary throws out a pair of pants.]
SpongeBob: Gary, I need to take a shower.
[Gary throws out a stick of "Stinky Pits" deodorant. SpongeBob rubs his armpits with the deodorant. Nearby, a mother and a child are watching what SpongeBob is doing.]
Debbie Rechid: I did not need to see that! Ugh!
[The mom jumps into the baby carriage and drives off. SpongeBob throws away the deodorant stick and puts his pants on.]
SpongeBob: All right, I guess you guys will just have to stay and go to work with me. Just keep a low profile or I could lose my job.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob flipping patties at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: Eh, SpongeBob. Did ya clean out the— [gasps as he sees the worms in SpongeBob's body] Sweet Dutchman's ghost! [rubs his finger against SpongeBob's body] When's the last time you took a bath, boy-o? You're riddled with vermin.
SpongeBob: I—I d—d—don't know what you mean, sir.
[SpongeBob inhales his worms into his body, but he runs out of breath and the worms fly out.]
Mr. Krabs: If customers find out you're touching patties with your wormy hands, the health department will shut us down for sure.
[SpongeBob's hands are covered with worms.]
SpongeBob: I understand, sir. Mr. Krabs, will you excuse me for a second? [whispering] Prickles, you heard my boss. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you and your friends to leave, please.
[Prickles goes inside SpongeBob's head and types out on a piece of paper.]
SpongeBob: [reads paper] "Squatters rights?" What the heck is squatters rights?
Mr. Krabs: [takes paper and reads it] Oh, they're "lawyering" up, boy-o. They're makin' a legal claim to keep living in your body.
SpongeBob: It's okay, Mr. Krabs, they're not hurting me.
Mr. Krabs: Son, you gotta understand. I can't have you work here in your present filthy "condisherin'."
[Prickles pops out and dumps garbage on the patties.]
Mr. Krabs: [irritated] Oh! That's the last straw! Mr. Squid—
Squidward: On it, sir! Hasta la vista, worm boy!
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob out of the restaurant with a broom. But as he pushes him out, the broom is now a really long pole made of a wooden plank, a tree trunk, a stop sign where Old Man Walker is tied up, and a flagpole where the flag is an inverted flag of Ukraine.]
Mr. Krabs: And don't come back until you're dewormed!
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do?
[SpongeBob tries to push some worms out of his body as Plankton walks by.]
Plankton: Hey, SpongeBo— Whoa! I see you've got yourself a little problem with the cooties.
SpongeBob: Yeah, and I lost my job over it.
Plankton: Lost your job you say? I might be able to help you, if you can do something for me.
SpongeBob: Anything, Plankton! Anything!
[Plankton puts on rubber gloves and grabs a tank of toxic gas for pests.]
Plankton: [chuckles] Ridding SpongeBob of his worms will put him forever in my debt. That secret formula is good as mine!
[SpongeBob picks Plankton up so he can enter his body and exterminate the worms.]
Plankton: Time to crash this lousy party. Get it? Lousy? Louse? Oh, I'm good.
[Plankton roars as he attempts to get rid of the worms. But the worms attack Plankton from left to right inside SpongeBob's body until they push him out. Plankton is now injured from his fight with the worms.]
Plankton: [groans] You're on your own, worm boy.
[SpongeBob is overwhelmed at his condition as the worms continue to party inside.]
French Narrator: Soon after...
[SpongeBob continues to fight off the worms as he runs over to Patrick's house. He knocks on the rock as the worms continue partying in his body. Patrick opens up.]
Patrick: Hello?
SpongeBob: You gotta help me!
[The worms cover around SpongeBob's eyes and mouth to make a scary face.]
Patrick: Ah! It's a monster with SpongeBob's voice!
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, wait, don't close the—
[Patrick shuts his rock.]
SpongeBob: Aw! Hmm?
[SpongeBob sees Squidward entering his house and attempts to walk over to him.]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! [his eyes and mouth are covered with worms] I need a hug!
[Squidward screams, takes out a hose, and sprays SpongeBob with water. SpongeBob's body becomes filled with water. A worm swims inside SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Does that mean no hug?
Squidward: There will be no hugs! Get away from me, you monstrosity!
[The worms jump out of SpongeBob and swim over to attack Squidward. Squidward screams and runs into his house. The worms go back inside SpongeBob as he sulks his way to his house, which is boarded up by Gary. Gary growls as SpongeBob walks until he stops. He turns around and his body has become an apartment. One of the worms is seen hanging her laundry on her clothesline. SpongeBob opens his body and sees various worms doing their daily activities. One elderly worm is watching television, two worms are hanging out at a jacuzzi, another worm is rap dancing, and one cranky worm is knocking on the ceiling with a broomstick. SpongeBob closes his body as he has completely lost his sanity.]
SpongeBob: Well, this is my life from now on, huh? [laughs] Just call me SpongeBob WormPants, cause that's all I am, just an apartment for worms! [laughing]
[As SpongeBob loses his sanity while laughing uncontrollably, the worms become annoyed by his constant laughter as he is shaking his body. The worms have had enough with his laughter and decide to leave his body once and for all. They gather up all of their stuff, load up their mini van, and exit SpongeBob's body.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, that's better. Looks like I really wormed my way out of that one. [laughs as Gary slithers up to him]
Gary: [sniffs] Meow!
[SpongeBob hugs Gary.]
SpongeBob: Gary, it feels so good to be worm free!
[SpongeBob carries Gary into his house. The worms that left SpongeBob's body enter Squidward's house and begin partying inside.]
Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob! I need a hug! [The short "Clam Up!" plays]
[The short opens with Prickles getting out of his house, which is a can of beans, one morning with sunglasses on. He walks to a mousetrap, opens it, and sits on it. He puts a sun reflector on him and drinks some lemonade. A shade comes upon him, and when he slightly takes off his sunglasses, he sees a giant clam on top of a piece of coral, squawking. He yells at it, but the clam continues squawking. He moves the mousetrap away from the shade, and gets tired after pushing it. He goes back on it and gets his sun reflector again, but the clam squawks even more louder than before. He takes off his sunglasses and throws a boot at it, then puts his sunglasses back on to relax some more. The clam goes beside him and squawks loudly at him, shocking Prickles and causing him to get trapped inside the mousetrap, which also makes the clam laugh]
[Prickles then cooks his beans on a pipe. The clam comes back and sniffs the smell coming from the beans. As he's cooking, the clam spits on him and eats the beans. He kisses Prickles, and when it leaves, Prickles rips off his clothing and yells for awhile, as two Bikini Bottomites walk by. He eventually gets tired of yelling and falls down]
[Prickles places a couple of beans in a line. The clam, who is flying around, sees the beans and eats them all, leading to the can of beans which the worm traps the clam in. He turns the can around, puts a stamp on it, and throws it into a mailfish's package as he was walking by. He waves goodbye and goes back to his house, only to realize he sent his house away and slaps his nose]
[At night, Prickles is walking with a hobo stick, scared of the surroundings. He gets shocked when he sees the mailfish severely beaten up. He also sees that the can of beans has been opened, and the clam appears behind him. He gets extremely scared, and the clam attempts to eat him after roaring at him. He hides behind a piece of coral as the clam is looking for him, and when the coast is clear, he comes out. He sees SpongeBob's house, and goes in there through the window.]


[At the Chum Bucket, with Plankton working on The Analyzer.]
Karen: Oh, Planky-bear? Plankton?
[Plankton ignores her]
Karen: Plankton!
Plankton: What? What is it, Karen? Can't you see I'm working there?! [points right close to the electronic components of The Analyzer]
Karen: Yes, but I wanted you to show you my new screensaver. [Shows a screensaver full of flying cake mixers] What do you think?
Plankton: [sarcastically, not looking at her, and still building electrical components] Great.
Karen: [rolls towards Plankton] You didn't even look.
Plankton: Ehh... [looks at Karen] No, I didn't! Can't you see I'm working on my new molecular analyzer? [The Analyzer starts picturing whatever Plankton says] Now all I need is the smallest molecule of a patty and the formula will be mine!
Karen: Just tell me if I should permanently upload the screensaver!
Plankton: I said not now– [accidentally switches The Analyzer on and he gets sucked up by The Analyzer's tube] oww-oww!
[Plankton gets processed into the various machines. He gets smashed by a boot and flipped, dragged over by a robot hand to be wringed out by two other robotic hands. Liquid Plankton goes into another machine to be zapped and processed into binary dump. Plankton makes drowning noises as he is being processed into binary dump.]
The Analyzer: Analyzing... 30% mean guy, 20% spiteful monster, 50% evil butt-head. Sample is... 100% big jerk. [Pushes out Plankton, who is now back in his normal form] I have also analyzed your screensaver, Karen. It is most beautiful! [Rainbow appears on his screen]
Plankton: No one asked you! [Smashes The Analyzer with a wrench] Are you happy now, Karen?
Karen: No, I'm not! I was just trying to make myself pretty for you, but do you even care? All you ever do is make stupid schemes about stupid sandwiches!
Plankton: Stupid? Your new screensaver is stupid and it makes your processor look fat!
Karen: [the cake mixers screensaver changes to a screen with fire; indicating her fury] What?!
Plankton: Oop! Okay, let's all calm down before you say something you'll regret!
Karen: You know what? No one talks to me like that! Get out!
Plankton: I will not get out! This is my restaurant and no one can make me... [gets kicked out] leave! [lands on his face] Ow! Karen, baby. Come on, sugar lips, you know I'm sorry for everything I said.
[Karen barricades the front door with iron bars.]
Medley Fishbowl: I accept your apology.
Plankton: I wasn't taking to you, idiot! [Medley lifts his foot and steps on him.] Pain! [gets up from squished form] Okay, Karen, fun is fun, but it's time to let me back in. Come on, I really need to use the potty!
[Karen barricades the front door with steel doors and lasers.]
Plankton: Fine, I don't need you or the Chum Bucket! I got plenty of friends around here who would love to take me in!
[The scene changes to Plankton talking to Mr. Krabs at his house.]
Plankton: So is it cool if I crash here?
Mr. Krabs: No!
Plankton: Then can I just use your bathroom?
[Mr. Krabs slams the door in Plankton's face and sends him flying in front of SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, I know where this is going. I'd love it if you'd stay with me!
Plankton: Are you crazy? You're the most annoying sponge in the sea. I wouldn't stay with you if you were the last person in Bikini Bottom.
[SpongeBob slurps on a drink. Plankton whimpers over this.]
SpongeBob: Suit yourself.
[SpongeBob walks off as he slurps his drink.]
Plankton: Okay, fine! [follows SpongeBob]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob's house. Plankton comes out of the bathroom.]
Plankton: Whew! Much better. Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Silly, that's not my bathroom.
Plankton: Well, in that case, you're gonna need some new shoes.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Does this mean you're gonna stay with me?
Plankton: [annoyed] Yes!
SpongeBob: Yeah! [pulls a string and confetti, a banner, and balloons fall down] We're gonna be the best roommates ever! Oh! Wanna do each other's hair? [laughs]
Plankton: Oh, forget this!
[Plankton attempts to leave, but SpongeBob grabs him and carries him while laughing.]
French Narrator: Many unbearable hours later...
[SpongeBob and Plankton are watching a movie.]
Male Actor: Oh, my love, what a fool I've been. You've always been the only one for me. [kisses his love]
[Plankton gets teary. He takes out a picture of himself with Karen and looks at it. Plankton starts to cry.]
SpongeBob: Aw, Plankton. I am so sorry that Karen threw you out.
Plankton: Threw me out? I threw her in! [throws away the picture]
SpongeBob: Hey, this is your safe place. It's okay to talk about your feelings. [rubs Plankton's head] Oh, somebody's tense!
Plankton: Hey! What? Get off! Get—Oh! [moans and laughs] Oh, that's the spot.
SpongeBob: Now, tell SpongeBob why you and Karen got into a fight.
Plankton: I don't know, I was just doing the same things I always do.
SpongeBob: Well, if Karen threw you out for doing the same things you always do, maybe you should learn to not do the same things you always do!
Plankton: But I'm the best.
SpongeBob: Well, sometimes you can get a little...aggressive.
Plankton: Me, aggressive?! How dare you?! [punches and smacks SpongeBob's spongy body until he becomes exhausted] Maybe you're right. I can be a big jerk sometimes. I command you to help me be a nicer person! [blushes then shakes SpongeBob's right eye] I mean, will you please, please help me be a nicer person so Karen will take me back?
SpongeBob: Plankton, in a word: yes!
[The scene changes to outside of SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is with Plankton and Patrick and has a door nest to them.]
Plankton: What is that dimwit doing here?
Patrick: Ahh! Oh, behind me! Oh, get away!
Plankton: Will you stop that?! There's no one behind you! You're the dimwit.
Patrick: Oh. Thanks!
SpongeBob: All right, Plankton, the first step to becoming a nicer person is being thoughtful. Try holding a door for someone. It's simple, and it makes people happy. Like this. [opens door] After you.
Patrick: [laughs] I'm happy, SpongeBob! [kisses SpongeBob as he enters through the door; SpongeBob laughs as he closes it] Can someone get me out of here? [SpongeBob opens the door] Whew!
SpongeBob: All right, Plankton. Now you try!
Plankton: Fine, but if he kisses me, I'm gonna lose it. [Patrick skips happily to the door] Ugh. After you.
[Plankton struggles to open the door, but it's too big and heavy for him to open. He continues to struggle until his eye pops out. SpongeBob picks him up.]
Plankton: Whoa!
[SpongeBob puts Plankton's eye back together and places him near a smaller door.]
SpongeBob: Try this one.
Plankton: [opens smaller door] After you.
Patrick: But I can't fit through there.
Plankton: How dare you reject my act of kindness! Yah!
Patrick: Ahh!
[Patrick jumps and flies into the smaller door, making him stuck. Plankton punches Patrick's butt.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, no!
Patrick: Can someone get me out of here?
[Plankton punches Patrick's butt and SpongeBob sighs. The scene changes back inside SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Plankton, since you don't seem to be able to do something nice, in this lesson you're going to learn to say something nice.
Plankton: Easy!
SpongeBob: Great. So turn to Patrick and say something nice.
[Plankton turns to Patrick, who is in a goofy appearance.]

SpongeBob: Say something nice.

Plankton: Uh... Patrick, you're not a total moron. Just half of one.
SpongeBob: No, try again.
Plankton: Fine. Your color pink is not so repugnant.
Patrick: Thanks! I like... um... your antennas.
Plankton: What? What's wrong with my antennas?!
SpongeBob: Plankton, Patrick was complimenting you.
Plankton: Yeah, right! You two are mocking me! [punches SpongeBob and Patrick's bodies]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob? Do you think this is working?
SpongeBob: No, I think we better try something else.
[Plankton collapses from exhaustion. The scene changes back to outside of SpongeBob's house.]
Plankton: It's no use, SpongeBob. I'm just too brilliant to be nice! I'll never get Karen back now.
SpongeBob: Oh, yes, you will! We obviously can't fix your terrible insides, but maybe, just maybe, we can work on your terrible outsides. Makeover time!
[The scene changes back inside SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob gives Plankton a makeover and makes him look like a 1960s hippie. He gives him another makeover and makes him look like a 17th century judge. He gives him various makeovers and makes him look like a cowboy from the old west, a motorcycle gangster, and a cute little schoolgirl.]
Plankton: Brother.
[SpongeBob goes behind the changing curtain and changes himself to look like a high school girl. He puts Plankton in his pocket vest. SpongeBob looks at himself in the mirror. Plankton growls in anger and hops out of the pocket vest. He takes a bowling ball, puts it in the pocket vest, and sends SpongeBob crashing into a wall. The scene changes to them sitting on the sofa.]
Plankton: [takes off wig] Forget it, SpongeBob. Karen's the perfect woman: so smart, so conniving! Ah, she's never gonna take me back.
SpongeBob: Oh, yes, she is. You just need to do something big. Be vulnerable, be sweet. Show Karen your heart. [points to Plankton's chest]
Plankton: That's a great idea! I'll cook up a scheme to make her jealous and crush her spirit! [laughs but turns to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: That wasn't even close to what I said.
Plankton: Sure it was. And I know just how to do it. [mimics cat meow]
SpongeBob: Okay, I feel uncomfortable.
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket. Plankton is straightening out his bowtie and SpongeBob is in a handmade robot costume.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, are you sure about this?
Plankton: Of course I'm sure! Now, start doing a robot voice. Remember, you're not SpongeBob anymore; you're Shelby Naughtica.
SpongeBob: [in robot voice] Oh, I like that! [enters the Chum Bucket with Plankton] Boop beep! Beep boop boop!
Karen: Welcome to the Chum Bucket! [notices Plankton] Oh. It's you. What do you want?
Plankton: Yes, hello. I would like your most romantic table for myself and my beautiful date, Shelby Naughtica, the robot.
SpongeBob: Beep boop! [laughs robotically]
Karen: Hmm. [analyzes SpongeBob's costume] Mm-hmm. Shelby Naughtica, huh? Oh, what a beautiful name.
SpongeBob: Thank you! [gets kicked in the foot by Plankton] Ow! [in robot voice] I mean, thank you. Whoa! Beep boop beep bo boop!
[SpongeBob and Plankton sit at a table.]
Karen: I'll be right back with our lovers' special.
[Karen heads to the kitchen.]
Plankton: [laughs] This is going so great, SpongeBob! Karen is totally jealous!
[Karen comes back with a bucket of raw chum meat and a bucket of greasy nuts and bolts.]
Karen: Here we go. I whipped up a special batch of chum for you, and for your lovely robot date, a bucket of grease chock-full of nuts and bolts.
SpongeBob: Plankton, I don't want to eat this!
Plankton: Don't you ruin this for me, SpongeBoob, just eat it!
[Plankton and SpongeBob eat their meals as Karen confidently watches them. SpongeBob and Plankton swallow their food.]
Plankton: Ugh. [grabs SpongeBob's hand] Oh, my dear, Shelby Naughtica, you are the most beautiful woman I've ever laid my eye on!
SpongeBob: Oh, Plankton-poo, you say the sweetest things!
Karen: [scoffs] Oh, brother.
Plankton: I never knew what love was until I met you!
SpongeBob: Oh! You have made me the happiest girl robot in the world!
Karen: Hey, you! Get your hands off my man!
SpongeBob: You better step off, lady! No one can make Plankton happy like I can. We are soulmates, and we're going to get married and print 1,347 babies. [various papers of robot pictures fly out of SpongeBob's costume]
Plankton: 1,000 what??!
Karen: Oh, well, you're really in love. I won't stand in your way. Plankton's all yours.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Plankton: No! The whole point of this scheme was for me to get Karen back, and now you're ruining it!
SpongeBob: [takes off his costume] Sorry, Plankton. You just said nice things to me.
Karen: Wait a second. You're not just being a jerk? You mean, you cooked this whole stupid scheme up to win me back?
Plankton: Of course I did. [jumps on SpongeBob's head] I'd do anything for you, baby, even hang out with this moron.
SpongeBob: Oh, that is so sweet!
Karen: Get over here, you.
[Plankton kisses Karen's screen. Karen turns on the screensaver she showed him earlier in the episode.]
Plankton: Eww, it's that fat screensaver again.
Karen: [her screen becomes fire again] What?!
[Karen jumps onto Plankton and begins beating him up.]
Plankton: Now, Karen, take it easy!
SpongeBob: I'm gonna go now. [runs out of the Chum Bucket]
Karen: My motherboard was right about you! She warned me about you! And I should've listened to her!
[The Chum Bucket jumps up and down from the beatings inside. Plankton is thrown out again like he was earlier in the episode.]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob once again trying to pass his boating test. SpongeBob is driving out of control.]
Mrs. Puff: Look out! Oh!
[SpongeBob hits the boat against the fence and the boat bounces back on the road. The boat swerves around in circles and a passing driver crash into the fence.]
Driver 1: Learn how to drive!
SpongeBob: I'm trying!
Mrs. Puff: Calm down, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff!
[SpongeBob comes up with an idea as a bottle of bubble soap appears above his head.]
SpongeBob: Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles! [blows lot of bubbles that covers the boat]
Mrs. Puff: No blowing bubbles while driving!
[SpongeBob's bubbles pops into the eyes of many drivers. SpongeBob's boat stops.]
Mrs. Puff: Phew! [sighs]
[The drivers appear out of the cloud of bubbles and crash into SpongeBob's boat, inflating Mrs. Puff in the process. SpongeBob laughs nervously as the drivers moan and groan in pain. Firefighters arrive to put out the fire.]
Driver 2: I can't feel my big toe.
SpongeBob: So, uh, how'd I do?
Mrs. Puff: [deflates herself] Get out! You're never getting a boating license!
SpongeBob: [whimpers as he goes to leave] But—but—
Mrs. Puff: [screams] Never! Never!
[SpongeBob curls up and sulks away. A piece of debris falls on Mrs. Puff's head, inflating her again.]
SpongeBob: I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership!
[SpongeBob notices Larry's boat at his gym.]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Ooh...
Tina Fran: It's really nice.
[The girls giggle.]
Larry: Oh, yeah, it's a turbo jet. 390 sea horse power with 11-to-1 pop-up piston. [chest revs like a racecar engine] We're talking some serious muscle!
[Larry turns on his boat and his engine roars.]
Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry! [hugs the tire]
[SpongeBob murmurs as he sees Larry's boat. He sulks off as the girls continue to admire Larry and his boat. SpongeBob continues to sulk back to his house until he sees Mr. Krabs washing his boat.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash! [wrings out his sponge] Isn't it?
[SpongeBob runs away, crying.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts.
[SpongeBob stops running and continues to cry. Then he notices Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out?
Patrick: Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now.
SpongeBob: Your boat. [shrinks] Sure, Patrick. See you later. [whimpers]
[Patrick hums as he takes out a flying disc.]
Patrick: Catch! [throws flying disc at the boat]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sulking behind his house. He blows a bubble version of Mrs. Puff.]
Bubble Mrs. Puff: You're a very good driver, SpongeBob, and my favorite student. Here's your license.
[The Bubble Mrs. Puff blows a bubble license and gives it to SpongeBob before she pops.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [bubble license pops] Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles. [sulks down; gasps] Oh! That's it!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob putting on some shades.]
Abigail Marge: Whoa!
Tom: What is that?
[SpongeBob appears to be driving in a bubble-shaped boat. As he drives it, everyone seems to take notice of it. He stops at a stoplight.]
Girls: Oh!
SpongeBob: All right, all right.
[SpongeBob bounces inside his bubble boat and makes it go faster. A boat in back of the girls' boat crashes at seeing SpongeBob's bubble boat. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by.]
SpongeBob: Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer?
Motorcycle Cop: Sir, I'm going to need to see your license for that, um...
SpongeBob: [laughs] You don't need a license to drive a bubble.
Motorcycle Cop: Hmm, I suppose you're right. Carry on, citizen.
[SpongeBob drives off with his bubble boat. The scene changes to SpongeBob coming home with his bubble boat. He enters his house and jumps in front of Gary, who is sleeping on his chair.]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Gary: [yowls]
SpongeBob: You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this!
[SpongeBob imitates his driving experience by floating around the house.]
SpongeBob: Then I made a right turn on red like this.
[SpongeBob imitates his right turn on red and floats around the living room. He lands on top of Gary.]
SpongeBob: You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true!
Gary: [grumbling] Meow.
[Gary goes back to sleep. SpongeBob hears a knock at the door.]
SpongeBob: Hmm?
[SpongeBob answers the door and sees various people.]
Green Fish: I'm here for a bubble boat.
Martin: Uh, yeah, me too!
Dave: I want one!
Various people: Uh, yeah, yeah, me too! Yes, please. One, please.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats.
Green Fish: Please?
SpongeBob: Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob carrying a large bottle-full of bubble soap for everyone to have bubble boats. He pushes the bottle into the tub and fills it with soap. He kicks the bottle away. The green fish grunts in excitement. SpongeBob takes out his bubble wand from his mouth.]
SpongeBob: One bubble boat coming right up!
[SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows the green fish a bubble boat.]
Green Fish: Thank you!
[The green fish drives off with his bubble boat.]
Plankton: Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I sure do, Plankton!
[SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows Plankton a bubble boat that appears to be a killer robot. Plankton tries to get in, but he bounces off because the bubble is too big.]
Plankton: Oof!
[SpongeBob takes out a straw and sips the bubble boat down to Plankton's size. Plankton gets into his bubble boat.]
Plankton: Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets! [cackles]
[Plankton starts to drive his boat, but gets stepped on by Larry within seconds.
Plankton: Ouch!
[SpongeBob looks on, disgusted, as Larry raises his foot, unsticking Plankton from his foot. Plankton, squished into a blob, crawls away.]
Plankton: Strike fear...
Larry: Hmm...blow me something that screams Larry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I'm on it, Larry!
[SpongeBob pulls out a bigger wand, dips it in the soap, inhales and blows three huge bubbles until he shrivels. The three bubbles form into a bubble boat that has muscles like Larry.]
Larry: Now, this is what I call a muscle car!
[Larry jumps into his bubble boat as Tina drives by with her bubble boat.]
Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry!
[Larry's bubble boat bulks up as they drive away. Just then, a huge line of people line up at SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo! [jumps into tub]
[SpongeBob absorbs the bubble soap and blows a huge amount of bubble boats for everyone. The crowd cheers. Meanwhile at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, Mrs. Puff is preparing for class.]
Mrs. Puff: [hums as she writes on the board] Greetings, class. My name is—[gasps]
[No one is there.]
Mrs. Puff: [startled stammer] Mrs. Puff. Oh, now that everyone's driving bubbles, they don't need licenses. [sighs] I guess there's just no place in this world for an old driving instructor.
[Mrs. Puff puts her apple in her apples box. She drives away from her Boating School and drives into the street.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Bah!
Fred: Hey, watch it, lady!
[Mrs. Puff swerves into a passing driver.]
Mrs. Puff: Ah!
Tom: I'm driving over here!
[Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.]
Mable: Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Mrs. Puff: Oh—wah!
[Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.]
Clay: Hey! Pick a lane, butter-brain!
[A stoplight turns red as Mrs. Puff frantically tries to drive. As she drives, she runs through a stoplight, popping many bubble boats in the process. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by on a bubble motorcycle.]
Motorcycle Cop: I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the boat, ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over?
Mrs. Puff: You ran my plates and saw my rap sheet?
Motorcycle Cop: What? No. Your vehicle has been outlawed, ma'am.
[A truck driver tolls Mrs. Puff's boat with his bubble truck, throwing out her apples in the process.]
Motorcycle Cop: Now that everyone drives bubble boats, real boats have been deemed too sharp and pointy to be street legal. [writes a ticket]
Mrs. Puff: But I've never driven a bubble!
[The motorcycle cop gives Mrs. Puff a ticket and leaves.]
Mrs. Puff: Bubble boating school?
[The scene changes to Mrs. Puff's Boating School now changed to Bubble Boating School. Mrs. Puff walks to the school, worried.]
Mrs. Puff: Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. [opens door] Please don't be SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob is seen at the desk.]
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [spins on the chair until he flies into the board] Hi, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Of course.
SpongeBob: You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P. [blows bubble] You'll be learning from a master.
[SpongeBob bounces his bubble around. He puts his foot on it and pops it, making him fall over.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [belches out bubble and laughs]
Mrs. Puff: Great.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the driving track in the bubble boat.]
SpongeBob: Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this.
[SpongeBob pumps his legs and makes the bubble boat move. He gives the steering wheel to Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff tries to do what SpongeBob did, but she loses her balance.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ooh! Oh!
[Mrs. Puff inflates herself inside the bubble boat.]
SpongeBob: Nice start.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff pumps her legs and manages to control the bubble boat. She makes a left turn from the wall and turns where the safety cones are. SpongeBob is writing down her scores. Mrs. Puff avoids prickly cactuses. However, she did not notice the cactuses that are on fire.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Fire!
[Mrs. Puff makes the bubble boat run through the burning cactuses and swerves it into the school's lighthouse. The lighthouse is set on fire and firemen arrive in their bubble firetruck to put out the fire. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff takes a deep breath and drives the bubble boat again. She goes over a hill, through a loop-de-loop hill, and drives past the flaming cactuses.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ah! Hmm. Hah. Eeh.
[Mrs. Puff stops the bubble boat at the starting line.]
Mrs. Puff: I did it.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, you're ready.
Mrs. Puff: Really?
SpongeBob: Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there. [points to people driving in their bubble boats]
Mrs. Puff: [whimpering] Oh.
[Mrs. Puff drives the bubble boat out of the boating school.]
SpongeBob: Nice and easy. Doing great.
[Mrs. Puff continues driving.]
Harold: Hello!
[Mrs. Puff waves to Harold.]
Mrs. Puff: You know, this whole bubble boating thing isn't so bad. [laughs] Maybe I could—
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out!
[Mrs. Puff frantically panics now that she is on the freeway.]
SpongeBob: It's okay! Just calm down!
[Mrs. Puff swerves the bubble boat to the left.]
Mrs. Puff: Eeh! Oh!
[A passing driver makes Mrs. Puff's bubble boat spin around. The bubble boat hits two other drivers and bounces off into another street. Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob are driving in a one-way street and almost get hit by other drivers.]
Mrs. Puff: Ah!
[SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff move around in the bubble boat in panic.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
[Mrs. Puff's bubble boat hits Nathiel Waters' bubble boat.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! [inflates herself and pops her bubble boat]
[SpongeBob was sent flying into the ground. He pulls his head out of the sand.]
SpongeBob: Ah!
[Mrs. Puff's inflated body causes a pileup in the middle of the road. The bubble boats send Mrs. Puff and the other drivers flying to the surface.]
SpongeBob: Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface?
[The bubble boats reach the surface and they pop, sending everyone falling downward. SpongeBob quickly takes out his bubble soap and blows a lot of bubbles. SpongeBob's bubbles catches and saves everyone.]
SpongeBob: Doh!
[SpongeBob blows one last bubble to save Mrs. Puff.]
Mrs. Puff: [wipes the soap off] No more bubbles. Get them off me!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles? [laughs]
Motorcycle Cop: [takes bubble wand] Give me that! Bubble boats are too unstable. They've been declared illegal. Everyone back to your regular boats! [breaks the bubble wand and leaves]
SpongeBob: Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! ♪La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la♪
Mrs. Puff: [inflates herself] Oh, joy. [pops]


The Greek Chorus: Behold! We are the Greek Chorus! We narrate this epic tale of stupidity!
[Title card music plays, and soon the opening credits appear. The episode starts afterwards.]
The Greek Chorus: [all clear throats together] Behold Neptune, god of the sea, [Neptune arrives] with his mighty trident, a weapon so powerful, [King Neptune picks his teeth, then flicks off the food gunk.] nothing is beyond its user's reach! Behold the Kraken! [The Kraken appears from the ground. It roars and sprays saliva over The Greek Chorus] Gross monster.
[The Kraken continues roaring. King Neptune fights against the monster with his trident. He creates a lightning fist and punches the Kraken to make it go very far away.]
The Greek Chorus: Behold Neptune triumphant! [King Neptune combs his hair with his trident] What an awesome dude! [King Neptune goes on his golden smartphone. SpongeBob walking with his spatula in his pocket and reading a comic book as he walks] Behold this idiot and beware, for trident trouble comes!
[SpongeBob accidentally knocks into King Neptune, who happens to be still on his smartphone, knocking their spatula and trident respectively to the ground.]
SpongeBob: Sorry. [unknowingly picks up King Neptune's trident while King Neptune unknowingly picks up his spatula. Both walk off]
The Greek Chorus: See?
[SpongeBob walks to the Krusty Krab, still reading his comic book as he walks. Inside the Krusty Krab, all the customers are acting wild and savage.]
Customers: [repetitively chanting] Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!
Fred: Food! Food! Ah. [takes SpongeBob's comic book and eats it.]
SpongeBob: Hey, I was still reading that! [force-opens Fred's mouth and reads the last few pages of the comic]
Squidward: Forget the stupid comic! We've got a situation here! We don't have any Krabby Patties, and these animals are trying to eat us instead! [a customer eats Squidward's arm. Squidward is stunned, then looks at his eaten arm.] Hey, who's responsible for this? [his arm is in an old lady's mouth, then she slurps it up, and then picks her teeth with a toothpick.]
Mr. Krabs: [sounding scared] Get to flipping those patties fast, boy-o! Before we all become the lunch special!
SpongeBob: I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen through the kitchen window hole, smacking through the "bowling pins" of ketchup and mustard bottles. "Order here" sign changes to "Strike!." Fred chomps off a piece of the sign.]
[SpongeBob takes some patties from his Krusty Krab employee hat, pushes them into him, then blows them out through the top of his head, onto the grill. SpongeBob swings Neptune's trident like a baton.]
SpongeBob: [suddenly notices masses of unchopped tomatoes and lettuces] Oh, the toppings haven't been prepped! I wish this lettuce and tomato would just cut themselves up! [trident magically turns the tomatoes and lettuce alive.]
Tomato #1: [with a knife and a cleaver] Let's do this!
Lettuce: Yeah! Cut me up good, girlfriend! [clicks fingers]
[Tomatoes and lettuce chop each other up]
SpongeBob: [sees that the tomatoes and the lettuces are chopped] Huh. I guess I did chop the toppings up after all.
Squidward: 37 Krabby Patties! Fast! [Customers grab Squidward and Tom eats his hat]
SpongeBob: 37 patties? How am I gonna flip 37 patties? [pauses] Huh, has my spatula always had three heads? [attempts to use trident as a spatula]
The Greek Chorus: [comes out of the cupboard] No! And it is not a spatula.
Mr. Krabs: Get them patties out here fast SpongeBob! [customers grab Mr. Krabs by the eye, leaving his clothes] Arrgh!
SpongeBob: Oh, I wish these Krabby Patties would just serve themselves so I could keep cooking. [trident magically assembles Krabby Patties into friendly living characters]
Krabby Patty #1: Hey! [starts clapping his hands above his head]
Krabby Patty #2: Yay! [also starts clapping his hands above his head]
Krabby Patty #3: Yeah! [once again also starts clapping his hands above his head]
Krabby Patties: [all start clapping his hands above their heads. Happily walking out of the kitchen] Woo! Woo! Woo!
SpongeBob: Whoa, my spatula never did that before.
Krabby Patties: [all start calling out in high-pitched voices] Krabby Patty! Krabby Patty!
[Squidward is hiding in his boat station, looking at the live Krabby Patties. Sandals is about to eat Mr. Krabs but stops when he notices the Krabby Patty walking up his table; he throws Mr. Krabs away.]
Mr. Krabs: [notices the Krabby Patties feeding themselves to the customers] Huh? [his pupils turn to the Krabby Patties then he flies like a rocket, where the smokes are coins.] I don't know how you're doing this, boy-o, but keep it up! Folks will pay every cent they have to watch Krabby Patties dance! Look at how cute they are!
[Shows Krabby Patties jumping into a fish's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: [surprised] We're running out of them dancing patties! Faster, boy-o! [pushes SpongeBob to the kitchen] Faster!
[SpongeBob races to the kitchen in attempt to make more of the dancing patties with his trident.]
SpongeBob: [keeps making prodding motions with the trident] Dance! Come on, dance! I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! [taps against a trident prong] I'm trying! [shakes trident] Come on, you, work!
Neptune's Trident: [grunts and moans]
The Greek Chorus: [opens the kitchen cupboard again. Gasps] The sponge has angered the trident. [covers their faces] Trouble comes. [instantly closes the cupboard doors]
[SpongeBob finally gets the trident to work. However, instead of making dancing Krabby Patties like before, the patties become wild and carnivorous. The monstrous Krabby Patties jump out of the kitchen and attack the customers. The customers run out of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: No! This is gonna cost me money!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I wish you wouldn't worry about money at a time like this!
[The trident zaps Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Right you are, boy-o! [give SpongeBob money and then gives everyone else money with his wheelbarrow] Here, take this! Here you go! I can't stop! [the two fish scream and run off while Mr. Krabs keeps giving away money] There you go! What's happening to me?!
SpongeBob: What is going on around here?
Neptune's Trident: Ahem. [points to switch]
SpongeBob: Hey, what's this? [flips switch and makes the trident bigger] Whoa! My spatula is magic!
The Greek Chorus: Magic, magic, magic.
SpongeBob: This is awesome! I will use this magic spatula to help everyone. [lifts trident but falls over on one side. He stands up and runs off to test the trident]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking down the street with the trident.]
Ivy: [at the Kelp Dogs stand with his wife] I'll have two, please.
[The baby drops his pacifier and cries. SpongeBob takes notice of the baby's dilemma.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I'll help you, baby! Boing!
[He shoots some of the trident's power and walks off. The trident's magic transforms the pacifier into a monster. The monster pacifier grabs and sucks the baby like a pacifier. SpongeBob takes notice of a man trying to grow his grass.]
Harold: What's wrong, grass? Why won't you grow? Talk to me. [hovers the ground]
[SpongeBob shoots some of the trident's power at the ground and grows grass. SpongeBob turns and leaves. However, unbeknownst to him, the grass grows larger and comes to life.]
Grass: We'll do more than just talk to yous! Let's see how you like getting mowed!
[The magic grass chase Harold with the lawn mower. SpongeBob jumps onto a rock.]
SpongeBob: There is no problem I cannot solve, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea! [trident magically turns SpongeBob into a God] Hey, get outta here, you pesky jellyfish! [jellyfish swims away]
The Greek Chorus: Whoa, slow your roll! Only Neptune, true ruler of the sea, can control the trident.
Neptune's Trident: [chuckles evilly]
[Meanwhile, King Neptune is having a chat with his wife, Queen Amphitrite.]
King Neptune: So I say, "Look, Zeus, either you come up with more money or Neptune walks."
[Queen Amphitrite laughs. However, she becomes scared and hides in the sand.]
Baby Kraken: [points to Neptune] There he is, ma! That's the man who hit me! [sobs]
Mother Kraken: Don't cry, baby. Mother will handle this. [snarls]
King Neptune: Let us battle! [takes out SpongeBob's  spatula] Take that! [splatters grease on the mother Kraken's dress]
Mother Kraken: Huh? [looks at the grease] This is dry-clean only, you monster!
King Neptune: [looks at spatula] "Property of SpongeBob?"
[The mother Kraken roars.]
King Neptune: Uh-oh.
[The mother Kraken punches King Neptune far out into the distance. The scene changes to Patrick eating an ice cream cone just as SpongeBob arrives.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. You look so sparkly today.
SpongeBob: Of course I do, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea. [light shines down on SpongeBob]
Patrick: Oh. [the light melts his ice cream] No! My ice cream! Ooh, why is the world so full of pain? [sobs and eats the cone]
SpongeBob: Fear not, bestest of friends. You shall have all the ice cream you could ever eat!
The Greek Chorus: No, you'll only make it worse!
[SpongeBob uses the trident's power to bring an ice cream truck to Patrick. However, the trident drops the truck and makes it flat, making dozens of ice cream fall out.]
Patrick: Ahhh! Best day ever! [grabs some ice cream]
Ice Cream Man: No, worse day ever. [slips] Oh, my back.
The Greek Chorus: See?
SpongeBob: I can fix this!
[SpongeBob uses the trident's power to repair the truck and put all of the ice cream back.]
Ice Cream Man: Hooray! [drives away]
Patrick: Boo!
SpongeBob: I think I know a way to make you both happy.
The Greek Chorus: You really don't. How do you not get that by now?
[SpongeBob climbs on top of Patrick's head and uses the trident's power form a geyser that spews ice cream from the ground.]
Patrick: An ice cream geyser!
[Patrick plugs his mouth through the opening of the geyser and eats a vast amount of ice cream. In doing so, he ends up getting stuck at the very top of the geyser and gets brain-freeze.]
Patrick: Brain freeze! I can't eat it all! Ah, I've never been more disappointed in myself.
[The geyser sends a torrent of ice cream and floods most of Bikini Bottom. People are running for their lives to escape the flood.]
Medley Fishbowl: Ooh, I like choc... [gets caught in the torrent]
Fred: [floats on a cherry] Oh, the creamy delicious horror.
Patrick: Save us, SpongeBob! Save us! No wait. [eats some more ice cream] Okay, now save us!
SpongeBob: Stop, ice cream! Stop! Stop!
[SpongeBob uses the trident's power to stop the geyser. Patrick lands safely on the ground. However, the geyser erupts ice cream again.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I just made it worse! Patrick, I've ruined everything.
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, I wouldn't say that.
[SpongeBob and Patrick then see Shubie and her husband chasing the monster pacifier with their baby in its mouth.]
Shubie: Our baby!
Harold: I'll never mow you again!
[SpongeBob and Patrick see Harold being chased by the living grass with his mower and Mr. Krabs appears while running after four fish while throwing money.]
Mr. Krabs: Take me money!
Patrick: [gets hit by a coin thrown at him] Ow! Okay, SpongeBob, you ruined everything.
SpongeBob: No sponge should have this much power.
The Greek Chorus: We told you so.
SpongeBob: [irritated] Not helping!
King Neptune: [injured] Well, maybe I can help. I believe I have something of yours. [holds up spatula]
SpongeBob: My spatula! T-Then what's this?
King Neptune: That is my trident!
SpongeBob: Well, take your trident. I don't want it anymore.
[SpongeBob gives the trident back to King Neptune but it zaps him.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Stop! That wasn't me.
The Greek Chorus: Too long away from its true master, the trident has run wild.
Male Greek Singer: What a jerk.
Neptune's Trident: [snickers sinisterly and shoots bolts]
SpongeBob: Sorry! Pardon me! It's stuck!
[King Neptune fights off the trident's power with SpongeBob's spatula.]
SpongeBob: Ahh! Make it stop!
[King Neptune continues to fight until he manages to snatch the trident from SpongeBob's hands and reclaims it while healing himself.]
King Neptune: You have been one naughty trident!
Neptune's Trident: [whimpers and cries]
King Neptune: Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
[The trident affectionately licks King Neptune and it pants like a dog.]
King Neptune: Now let's see if we can fix all of this.
[King Neptune uses the trident's power to stop the geyser and reverse the damages SpongeBob did with it.]
Mr. Krabs: [holding a bat and threatening two fish holding his money] Give me back me money!
[Shubie carries her baby with its regular pacifer. Harold mows the lawn.]
Grass: Mow us good! [gets mowed]
King Neptune: You know, SpongeBob, your spatula is just as powerful as my trident.
SpongeBob: Really?
King Neptune: Ha! Not even close! [laughs] But it's still pretty great.
SpongeBob: Thanks for bailing me out, Neptune. If there's any way I can ever help you, just let me know.
King Neptune: Well, there is one way.
[The scene changes to King Neptune and SpongeBob confronting the two Kraken.]
King Neptune: There they are!
[The two Krakens growl then they gasp.]
SpongeBob: Let's get 'em!
[SpongeBob and King Neptune chase the two Kraken with the monstrous Krabby Patty.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. A scream is heard and an angry customer walks up to the register.]
Shubie: I wish to register a complaint!
[She shows Squidward a sea urchin on her Krabby Patty. The urchin growls.]
Squidward: [screams] An urchin!!
Shubie: Yuck!
[She throws her patty and the urchin in the register boat.]
Squidward: Hey, lady, take your infested-patty with you! Okay, no need to panic, Squidward. It's just a puny urchin. Everything's gonna be fine as long as you...[grabs his cash register and smashes the urchin with it] Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! [falls into the register and gets up] Whew!
[Squidward sees the urchin on his nose and freaks out. He attempts to smash the urchin with the register, but ends up getting smashed in the face. SpongeBob comes by, pushes the button, and Squidward pops his head out from the register. The urchin is heard whimpering.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, I'm surprised at you. That little urchin wasn't hurting anyone. [removes the urchin from Squidward's nose] He's still one of Neptune's creatures. No matter how small he is. [walks into the kitchen with the urchin] This is where the magic happens, little urchin. First, we turn up the heat, but don't make it too hot. [turns on the heat on the grill] Would you like to see a menu, Monsieur? [laughs as the urchin bites SpongeBob's nose] Ow!
[The urchin falls onto the knob, turns the grill up to a high temperature, and crawls underneath.]
SpongeBob: Okay, little guy, see you later. [rubs his nose] Good thing he is a little guy. Ouch.
[As SpongeBob leaves to get more patties, the grill turns red-hot. SpongeBob comes back with the patties and flops them on the grill. The patties hop up and down in a Latin rhythm and SpongeBob dances. Outside the kitchen, Squidward is sweating from the grill's high temperature and his employee hat catches on fire. SpongeBob dances so much that his body begins to sweat. His sweat drops fall on the hot grill and gives off steam. The patties are completely burned and they shrink to a smaller size.]
SpongeBob: What the shrimp? [his body starts shrinking] Hey, what's going on here? [notices the high temperature on the grill] Whoa! That's too hot! [tries to turn the grill down, but his fingers are too sweaty] Whooaaa!!! [shrinks down to a smaller size and comes out from the sleeve of his pants] Wow. [notices he's naked] Oops. [laughs]
[SpongeBob climbs up to the condiment counter and grabs two pickles slices for clothing. He walks over to the toaster and looks at his reflection.]
SpongeBob: I steamed myself tiny. Whoo-hoo! I steamed myself tiny! Whoo! [turns and sees the entire kitchen] This place is huge! [gasps and jumps back down to the floor] My spatula's huge! And just look at the size of my grill. It's huge! [climbs up to the grill, touches the surface and burns his toe] Ow!
[SpongeBob grabs two slices of butter and plops his feet on them to make them as ice skates. He sings to himself and skates a figure eight on the grill's surface. However, because of the high temperature, the butter immediately melts and SpongeBob's feet catch on fire.]
SpongeBob: Ow! [stammers and screams]
[SpongeBob jumps into a can of ketchup. He sighs in relief. Then he attempts to flip the patty with his spatula.]
SpongeBob: [grunting] Come on, flip! Whoa! [gets flopped by the patty]
[SpongeBob drills a hole through the patty with his drill-like nose. He pulls out his drill-nose and recreates a new one. He laughs just as the grill short-circuits and blows out.]
SpongeBob: Uh-oh. The grill blew out. Well, [sniffs] it isn't gonna fix itself. [flicks his nose] That's one small step for SpongeBob, one giant leap for— [jumps down to the bottom of the grill] Whee!! [lands in a goop of grease] Whoa! [absorbs the grease, which makes him lose his pickle clothes] Bob. [sprits the grease out] Whew! [slips a little bit] Whoa!
[SpongeBob wanders around under the grill and hears a noise as if someone is crying.]
SpongeBob: What is that?
[SpongeBob climbs on a rotten Krabby Patty and sees the urchin caught in a trap.]
SpongeBob: Hey, it's my little urchin friend. Aww, hey, little guy, don't cry. Your old pal, WheeBob, will get ya outta there.
[SpongeBob tries to pull the spring-loaded bar up, but ends up pulling off his arms. SpongeBob then uses his teeth to hold the bar up, which frees the urchin. But SpongeBob ends up losing his dentures. He smiles and laughs.]
SpongeBob: Little urchin, you are free to go! You okay?
[The urchin roars and SpongeBob screams. The urchin then gives SpongeBob a chase.]
SpongeBob: [pricks SpongeBob with its prickles] Yeouch!
[The urchin chases SpongeBob up to the grill, across the fryers and up to the soda dispenser. SpongeBob clings on the lever and pours soda on the urchin.]
SpongeBob: Sorry little guy! [falls off the lever] Whoa!
[The soda sends SpongeBob and the urchin down the drain in the middle of the floor.]
SpongeBob: Whoo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[SpongeBob clings onto one of the holes of the drain while the urchin falls deeper into the sewer.]
SpongeBob: Follow the pipes to freedom, little guy! I'll never forget you. [pulls the prickle off his butt] Really. [climbs out of the drain and hears a loud noise] Ow! What is all that noise?
Squidward: [rings bell] One Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: Comin' right up!
[SpongeBob carries a Krabby Patty out from the kitchen and into the dining room. Squidward takes notice of SpongeBob and thinks he's another urchin.]
Squidward: Urchin?! [grabs a ladle and pushes a customer aside] Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!
[Squidward swings his ladle around as he attempts to hit SpongeBob. In doing so, he ends up hitting the customers and knocking over several tables. During the chase, SpongeBob bumps into Mr. Krabs' foot.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah-ha! [picks up the patty with SpongeBob] You're gettin' sloppy, Plankton. Squidward almost squashed ya. [laughs and opens the door] Back to the bucket with ya!
SpongeBob: No! No, Mr. Krabs! It's meeee!!!! [gets kicked out and sent flying to the doors of the Chum Bucket] Whoa-ho! [lands safely on the floor]
[Karen scans SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [giggles] That tickles.
Karen: Well, SpongeBob SquarePants, it looks like you lost a little weight.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Karen. Where's Plankton?
Karen: You landed on him.
[SpongeBob looks down and sees that he is sitting directly on Plankton.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton! [gets off]
Plankton: SpongeBoob? Why are you so small? Is this a trick?
Karen: Calm down. He's clean. I frisked him.
SpongeBob: I didn't mean to get small like you, Plankton. It was a freak accident.
Plankton: Huh? Who are you callin' a freak?! Wait a second. [giggles and takes out a tape measure] Hold this. [measures SpongeBob while he holds the tape; gasps] You're not small like me, Shorty! I am a towering half-a-millimeter taller than you! [laughs] I win! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: Hooray! [lets go of the tape and Plankton gets himself tangled in it] I'll get that.
Plankton: Don't touch that! [gets sliced up by the tape]
SpongeBob: Oops.
Plankton: [falls into pieces] Get him outta here, Karen!
Karen: Way ahead of ya, Chief.
[Karen flicks SpongeBob out of the Chum Bucket and sends him flying into the windows of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob slides down the window just as a purple kid comes by.]
Kid #1: Cool!
[The kid grabs SpongeBob and chews on him like gum. Then he runs into the restaurant and meets up with his friends.]
Kid #1: [spits SpongeBob out] Ha, ha! I've found an action figure!
Kid #2: Whoa! I saw it first!
Kid #3: No, I did!
Kid #1: Finders keepers!
[The purple kid swings SpongeBob during the fight.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!!
Kid #2: What's the matter with you?
SpongeBob: [gets licked by the purple kid] Bleach!
Kid #1: Got my spit on it!
SpongeBob: [slips out of the kid's hand] Whoa! You can't catch me! [laughs]
[SpongeBob runs into the Krabby Playland ball pit while the kids chase him.]
Kid #1: Stop him! Don't let him get away!
[The kids jump in the ball pit and send numerous balls flying. SpongeBob rides on a red ball and bounces on several tables. The kids continue chasing him, knocking over several tables in the process. SpongeBob jumps off the ball and laughs.]
Kid #1: [gets hit by the ball] This is the best action figure ever!
[SpongeBob jumps into the register boat and hops into Squidward's shirt pocket.]
SpongeBob: SpongeBob in the corner pocket! Doink!
[The kids jump into the register boat and pummel Squidward.]
Squidward: You brats get back in the play area or I'll eighty-six your face!
[SpongeBob, who is on Squidward's head, blows a raspberry, dances, laughs and shakes his butt.]
Kids: We want our action figure back!
[The orange kid kicks Squidward's leg.]
Squidward: Ow!
[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: Krusty Krab action figures aren't free ya know! So, get your parents' money and you can have it.
[The kids stare menacingly at the other customers. Everyone leaves their tables and run out while the kids chase them.]
Squidward: Uh, Eugene, we don't sell action figures.
Mr. Krabs: [looks at SpongeBob] Hmm...
SpongeBob: Peekaboo!
[Mr. Krabs gasps.]
Squidward: What the—[faints]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing in my hand? And why aren't you back there flippin' patties?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. K. I shrunk myself by mistake. But I won't let it affect my job. I will get back to flippin' right now. [goes for the kitchen, but gets pulled back by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, Tiny. I can't have you workin' the grill no more. Too dangerous for a little guy like you.
SpongeBob: Oh, please, Mr. Krabs! There must be some job I could do! I don't care what it is! Please, please, please!
Mr. Krabs: Alright, I'll think of somethin'. But since you're so small now, I can only pay ya a penny. A year.
SpongeBob: Whoa! [receives a penny] That's big money! [gets squished by the penny] Whoa!
Mr. Krabs: Hmm. Now what could I do with a little SpongeBob?
[Mr. Krabs forms a thinking cloud while he thinks. In the cloud, a sign is formed with the words, "Personal Hygiene Service" on it. He likes the idea and takes the sign from the thinking cloud. He swipes the cloud away and hammers the sign on the menu.]
Dirty Customer: Personal Hygiene Service?
[The customers line up.]
Customer: Did you see that? Personal Hygiene Service!
Mr. Krabs: Roll up your sleeves, boy-o! You're a personal hygienist now!
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! Yay!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob cleaning the food off of a customer's teeth. Then he rubs his body around the back of another customer.]
Tom: Oh, right there. Yeah.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob mowing the back hair of another customer's back with a mini lawnmower. Then he cleans the fungus out from under the toe of another customer.]
SpongeBob: Whew!
Mr. Krabs: Break time, SpongeBob! Take five, but hurry back! You gotta start earnin' that penny!
[SpongeBob runs into the kitchen and climbs onto the sink to wash up.]
Squidward: [walks in the kitchen, mumbling] Hmph. Work the register, clean the windows, make the patties. I have to do everything now. Thanks a lot, ShrinkBob. [flips a patty but ends up getting it in his eye, burning it] Ow! Ow! [grunts as the patty falls on the grill]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward! I'll make the patties for you—oh. Yeah. I forgot. I'm too little. [sits down on a bar of soap] Boy, I'm really gonna miss my old job.
[Squidward puts eye drops in his burnt eye.]
Mr. Krabs: Lunch rush is over, Mr. Squidward! Now, wash those dishers!
Squidward: [growls and mumbles] "Lunch rush is over, Mr. Squidward. Now, wash some dishes."
[Squidward stomps over to the sink, grabs SpongeBob and rubs him against a dirty dish with soap and water. Suddenly, the soap and water makes SpongeBob grow bigger.]
SpongeBob: The bubbles are making me bigger! More bubbles!
Squidward: What the—[freaks out and throws SpongeBob in the sink]
SpongeBob: Thank you, Squidward! I'm big enough to flip patties again! [grows larger due to the soap and water] Oh-ho-ho!
[SpongeBob grows larger until his arms, while holding Mr. Krabs and Squidward, pop through the walls of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa!
Squidward: Ahh!!
[SpongeBob's head pops through the ceiling. The customers are squished against the windows.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, call the fire department!
SpongeBob: No need to call 'em, Mr. Krabs. [pulls his feet through the floor] We'll be there in five minutes depending on traffic. [laughs as he walks off with Squidward and Mr. Krabs in his hands and while using the entire restaurant as new clothes]
Mr. Krabs: Make a left at the light!


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are having a medical exam. SpongeBob is giggling behind the curtains and jumps up and down.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward. What do you think the nurse is doing to him in there?
Squidward: It's called a "checkup." It's an invasion of your personal space that's good for you.
[SpongeBob screams behind the curtains. Squidward and Mr. Krabs gasp. Behind the curtain, the nurse grabs SpongeBob as if she is going to strangle him. Mr. Krabs bites his claws in fear. Behind the curtains, SpongeBob is shape-shifting himself in front of the nurse.]
Nurse: Sir, please hold still! I need to check your reflexes.
SpongeBob: Sorry, nurse lady. I've never had a checkup before. It's so much fun!
[The nurse hits SpongeBob's knee with her medical hammer and SpongeBob's leg curls up. SpongeBob's leg squeals.]
Nurse: [sighs] You seem fine...physically, at least. [shows her clipboard] Congratulations. You pass.
SpongeBob: [jumps out] Wow! Imagine if it was this easy to get your boating license!
Squidward: Eh. The world shudders at the thought.
Nurse: Mr. Tentacles?!
Squidward: Finally! Let's get this over with! [walks behind the curtains]
[SpongeBob puts his medical examination paper in his head.]
Mr. Krabs: [whimpering] Ooh...So, Boy-o...how was it in there? Anything I should be...terrified of?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs! Getting a checkup is the best! The nurse poked me [pokes himself] and prodded me [prods himself] and jabbed me... [punches himself] and pulled me [stretches] and twisted me. [twists himself] And—
[Mr. Krabs covers SpongeBob's mouth.]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, okay. That's enough. [giggles]
Squidward: You want me to what?
Mr. Krabs: [whimpering] Ooh...
Nurse: [points to sample cup] Fill this, please.
Squidward: Hmph. [mumbling as he takes the cup]
[Squidward and the nurse look at each other for a bit.]
Squidward: Could I get a little privacy?
[Squidward turns around and whizzes some of his ink in the cup. He hands the cup back to the nurse.]
Nurse: Hmm...good color. [dips a pen in the ink and writes on the clipboard] Solid line fidelity. The ink is a little thick, though.
Squidward: Hey!
Nurse: You just need to drink more water. You pass. [gives Squidward his medical examination paper; she and Squidward walk out behind the curtains] Is there a...Eugene Krabs?!
SpongeBob: Your turn, Mr. K.
[Mr. Krabs runs into his office, locks the door, and barricades himself behind brick walls. Mr. Krabs opens his safe, takes out the formula, and hides in the safe.]
Squidward: Ha, ha! Looks like the old man is scared of getting his checkup.
Nurse: This is no laughing matter! Every employee must get their checkup or the restaurant will be closed under orders of the Bikini Bottom Better Business Bureau.
Squidward: [gasps] Not the...B.B.B.B.B!
SpongeBob: You heard her. The...[flaps his lips]
Squidward: Perhaps we could reach some sort of understanding.
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, I know! We'll give Mr. Krabs his checkup over the weekend and you just pick up the results on Monday. [in singsong as he forms the words, "Everybody Wins" and the heavenly chorus sings in the background] Everybody wins!
Squidward: I was just gonna bribe her. [pulls out some money]
Nurse: Monday works. [takes the money and leaves]
SpongeBob: Yay! We get to spend the weekend together!
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs walking down the streets on Bikini Bottom.]
Mr. Krabs: [humming] Dodged that bullet!
SpongeBob: [peaks from behind a building and gasps] He's coming!
Squidward: It says here the first part of Krabs' exam is the pinch test. We just need to do it in a way he doesn't know he's being tested!
SpongeBob: Way ahead of ya! [makes a charity box that offers free money with an empty cardboard box] We'll make him an offer he can't resist!
Squidward: [reading] "Free Money Inside." Ha. Not bad.
SpongeBob: [grabs Squidward] Come on, before he sees us! [pulls him in the box]
[Mr. Krabs comes by.]
Mr. Krabs: [humming] Huh? Free money, hey? [chuckles] Don't mind if I do!
[Mr. Krabs shoves his claw in the box and moves around.]
Mr. Krabs: [humming] Where's that money? I'm not feeling any money!
[As Mr. Krabs tries to find money, his claw almost grabs Squidward and SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Okay. I brought plenty of things for Mr. Krabs to pinch—a pinch of salt—
[Mr. Krabs' claw flips the plate of salt into SpongeBob's face, which causes him to shrink and dry up. SpongeBob inhales some water in his body.]
SpongeBob: [holds up a baby] A baby's cheek!
[Mr. Krabs' claw chops off the baby's head, which turns out to be a robot.]
SpongeBob: Lucky that was a robot baby. [throws the robot in Squidward's face]
Squidward: SpongeBob, quit fooling around! [gets grabbed in the nose by Mr. Krabs' claw] Ow! [moaning as the claw twists his nose] We need to test his ability to pinch something tough, you ninny!
SpongeBob: Tough, huh? Gosh, the toughest thing I can think of is...Mr. Krabs himself!
[SpongeBob grabs Mr. Krabs arms and ties them together. Mr. Krabs' right claw pinches his left claw, causing him to groan in pain. The claws crack and break into pieces, revealing his flabby, soft skin underneath.
Mr. Krabs: [shrill scream] Ohhh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! Me achin' pinchers! And I didn't even get any money!
[A coin is tossed out of the box.]
Mr. Krabs: Hee hee! A penny! It's me lucky day! [giggling as he tries to pick up the penny]
Squidward: Pinch test failed. Well, maybe he'll do better on the eye stalk test.
[The scene changes to Tailor Tom's Tailor Shop. SpongeBob puts a sign that says, "Free Suits Today Only" on the store's window. Mr. Krabs comes by with bandages on his claws. He then takes notice of the sign on the store's window.]
Mr. Krabs: Free suits? Oh, boy! [runs into the store]
SpongeBob: [disguised as a tailor with Squidward as the legs] Welcome, sir.
[Squidward attempts to walk through the disguise, but keeps tripping over various things.]
SpongeBob: Step up here, and we'll begin.
[Mr. Krabs steps up on the platform while SpongeBob looks down.]
SpongeBob: [quietly] Squidward, do you have the measuring tape?
[Squidward reaches in the suit's pocket and gives SpongeBob the measuring tape.]
SpongeBob: Just grabbing some measurements...
[SpongeBob measures Mr. Krabs' eyes and wraps them around with the measuring tape. He tightens his eyes with the tape and spins him around.]
SpongeBob: Sir, try to keep still.
[SpongeBob moves Mr. Krabs' eyes and they tick-tock like a metronome. Then he squeezes Mr. Krabs' left eye.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa, there! Don't you need some other measurements? I mean, how 'bout my inseam? [jangling as he shakes his butt]
SpongeBob: Uh, no, you can put that away, sir. I'm almost done.
[Squidward kicks Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob pushes Mr. Krabs' left eye a couple times, which makes both of the eyes go up and down on the right socket. Then he shakes Mr. Krabs' left eye, but accidentally breaks it off.]
Mr. Krabs: Aah! That's it! [grabs his eye] Get off me, you terrible tailor!
[Mr. Krabs walks out of the store, with his right eye wearing a suit and hat.]
SpongeBob: Tell your friends about us!
Mr. Krabs: Not likely!
Squidward: [sticks his head out of the disguise] How'd he do?
SpongeBob: Oh, he didn't make the cut.
Squidward: Of course. [holds up clipboard] Up next, it says we have to get him an X-ray of him. Any ideas?
SpongeBob: I do have one plan that might work.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs putting his left eye back in place.]
SpongeBob: [disguised as a photographer] Hello there, sir! Are you rightfully afraid of your own mortality? Wanna make sure that when you're gone, you are not forgotten? Well, step on up and marvel at the latest technological wonder—photography! [shows some photos] Preserve your precious punim for generations to come! [flies around and falls on his face] Conquer time itself at absolutely no charge to you!
Mr. Krabs: No charge, hey? [spits and makes himself pretty] Well...I am very "photogeneric."
[Mr. Krabs steps into the photo booth.]
Mr. Krabs: Let's see...how do you start this thing? Oh! Here we go!
[Mr. Krabs pushes the red button and the x-ray examines him. Outside the photo booth, Squidward and SpongeBob are looking at Mr. Krabs' skeleton through the x-ray.]
Mr. Krabs: Hoo! Gettin' kinda hot in here! [chuckles and the x-ray continues to scan; smoke begins to spew out] Should my underwear be on fire?
SpongeBob: How many X-rays of Mr. Krabs do we need?
Squidward: [looks at the clipboard] Just one. How many did you set it to take?
SpongeBob: 25...thousand?
Mr. Krabs: Uh...this is getting a little...[gibberish] Eh...thank you. [comes out and is completely electrocuted from the x-ray] No more pictures, please. [walks off and his skeleton inside him crumbles into dust]
SpongeBob: Squidward, is his skeleton supposed to just fall apart like that?
Squidward: Not at all. On to the next test.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs, who appeared to some what recovered from his x-ray experience, walking past the spa.]
Mr. Krabs: [moans] Oh...oh... Oh, what a day.
SpongeBob: [comes out of the spa, disguised as a hippie] Hey, man, you look like you've had a rough day. How'd ya like to chill out with a nice massage? It's free.
Mr. Krabs: [shakes his head] Free, huh?
SpongeBob: Free.
Mr. Krabs: Eh. Okay. Let's get this over with. [walks into the spa]
Squidward: Remember, [holds up the thermometer] this is the cold-blooded test. Just take his temperature.
SpongeBob: You got it, best friend.
Squidward: Don't call me that.
SpongeBob: [pokes Squidward's nose with the thermometer] Boop!
Squidward: [stammers as he leaves] Don't you do that!
[SpongeBob walks back into the spa and Mr. Krabs is laying naked on the table.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready!
SpongeBob: All right, man, let's see if we can, like, work out some of this tension. [pulls down a rope and the mattress sends Mr. Krabs flying]
Mr. Krabs: Why, you—Oh, no, no, no, no, no! [flies into the freezer]
[The freezer door closes and SpongeBob pulls the lever to the freezing point.]
Squidward: How's the cold-blooded test going?
SpongeBob: Great! He's in the freezer right now.
Squidward: SpongeBob, you moron! Cold-blooded means your body is the same temperature as the water around it, not that you're actually cold!
[Mr. Krabs comes out of the freezer, shivering in a block of ice.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward? Whyyyyyy?
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm so sorry! We had to give you your physical without you knowing, or the Krusty Krab would've been shut down, and I'd have to get a real job!
SpongeBob: All right! Final test! Shell durability! [whacks the block of ice with a mallet]
Mr. Krabs: [the ice cracks] No, no, no, no, no, no! [stammering]
[The ice, along with Mr. Krabs' shell and teeth, breaks into pieces, leaving him toothless and revealing his flabby, soft skin.]
Mr. Krabs: [muffled, lisping] Now you see why I don't like checkups? [sobbing]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Yes, you failed every test today, but Squidward and I will whip you into shape, even if it takes the rest of the weekend!
[Mr. Krabs continues to sob. The scene changes to Mussel Beach at Goo Lagoon, where Larry the Lobster is doing some weight-lifting with some other strong fish. Mr. Krabs is also there, attempting to do some weight-lifting with SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Let's kick it up a notch! [adds some heavier weights]
[Mr. Krabs struggles to lift the heavier weights with all of his might while his eyes form veins. However, his arms break into pieces due to how heavy they are.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa—no!
[His arms blow out air and Mr. Krabs flies around like a deflating balloon. He lands on a treadmill and begins to run on it. SpongeBob turns the dial and makes the treadmill go super fast. As Mr. Krabs runs, he hyperventilates and the treadmill begins to shred Mr. Krabs into dust.]
Mr. Krabs: [stammering] Oh—oh—no—oh, jeez—ohh!
[Mr. Krabs is now a pile of dust and the scene changes to Mr. Krabs' house.]
SpongeBob: I don't know what we did wrong, Squidward. Mr. Krabs looks worse than before!
[Mr. Krabs moans in pain inside his broken shell.]
Squidward: I guess that nurse is gonna close the Krusty Krab after all. I wish I could say it's been a pleasure working with you.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, I'll miss you too! [hugs Squidward and sobs]
Mr. Krabs: Quit yer blubberin', boy. Me body may be mush, but me mind's sharp as a tack! And I...have a plan.
[The scene changes back to the Krusty Krab.]
Nurse: Good morning! I assume your boss passed his physical?
Squidward: Oh, um...yes. Of course he did. Um, unfortunately, our results were—
SpongeBob: Uh, eaten!
Squidward: [covers SpongeBob's mouth] Yeah, yeah. Um, anyway, we thought you could give old Mr. K another exam yourself. He's in his office.
Nurse: Hmm...Very well.
[The nurse walks into the office. SpongeBob and Squidward run to the door and hear various noises inside. Then moments later, the nurse comes back out.]
Nurse: Mr. Krabs...not only did you pass your exam, you might be the most astonishingly excellent physical specimen I've ever seen! [laughs]
SpongeBob and Squidward: Whew!
Larry: [wearing Mr. Krabs' clothing] My name is Mr. Krabs, and I love money!
Nurse: Yes. You said so several times during the examination.
[Larry imitates Mr. Krabs' laugh.]
Nurse: I suppose I won't need to close your restaurant today. See you next year. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: [comes in on a wheelchair with bandages] Whoo-hoo! We did it, boys! The Krusty Krab lives to see another day! Three cheers for a successful ruse!
SpongeBob: Let's just make it one.
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Hip, hip, hooray!
Larry: [comes out of the office] So, you said there would be some money in this for me?
[Mr. Krabs squeals. Larry, Squidward, and SpongeBob pause for a moment as they look at Mr. Krabs' broken shell. Squidward touches Mr. Krabs' shell and it crumbles into dust. Mr. Krabs, who is without his shell, runs out and laughs like crazy.]
Mr. Krabs: You'll never get me money! [laughs as he runs away without his shell]


[The episode begins with showing the exterior of the Chum Bucket. It then cuts to the Lab of the Chum Bucket, where Karen, who is in her mobile form, is dusting off some bottles. A purple bottle rolls into her and she stops.]
Karen: Huh? Mm, I don't remember this bottle. [opens it and peeks inside]
Plankton: Poof! [appears in a genie costume from a purple-ish dust cloud] Alakazam! Your wish is my command!
[Karen scans him and identifies him as Plankton.]
Karen: I wish you back in the bottle. [pushes Plankton with the cork]
Plankton: Ow! [pulls himself out] Hey, cut it out.
Karen: All right, what's with the Ali Baba routine?
Plankton: It's my new scheme, Karen. I get Krabs to believe I'm a genie, I break this bottle, and then he's gonna put me in another bottle.
Karen: I hope it's a baby bottle because you look adorable.
Plankton: No, Karen, you hope it's the secret formula bottle because then we'll rule the fast food world!
Karen: Yeah, keep messing with that old crab, and the only container you'll need is an urn. [pushes Plankton in the bottle with the cork]
Plankton: Ow!
[Karen puts the bottle down and kicks it out of the Chum Bucket. The scene changes to Plankton pushing the bottle to the front door of Mr. Krabs' house.]
Plankton: [humming] Krabs should be heading out for work right about now. [opens the bottle and climbs back inside]
[A very tired Mr. Krabs opens the front door, yawns and stretches his right arm. His arm grabs Thaddeus' newspaper and coffee mug. Mr. Krabs drinks the coffee and becomes wide awake. He goes to read the newspaper while walking to work. As he walks, his foot kicks the bottle with Plankton inside.]
Plankton: Ow! [exclaiming]
[The bottle rolls towards the lamppost and flies into the rotating rudder of a boat.]
Plankton: Whoa, whoa, whoa! [screaming]
[The bottle rolls down the road towards the Krusty Krab. Inside the bottle, Plankton is having a rough time during the bumpy ride.]
Plankton: [grunting and exclaiming] Ow, ow, ow!
[SpongeBob is cleaning the windows outside the restaurant. The bottle rolls over SpongeBob's feet.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, pick up that trash. [enters the restaurant]
SpongeBob: [stops cleaning windows and salutes] And a good morning to you, Mr. Krabs. [picks up the bottle and goes to throw it in the trashcan; but takes notice of it and gasps] Whoa, it's so pretty.
Plankton: Oh, no, that's SpongeBob. [SpongeBob shakes the bottle] Oof, oof!
[SpongeBob continues shaking the bottle and shrugs as he sees there's no worries.]
SpongeBob: I'm going home for my lunch break, Mr. Krabs! [opens the bottle and blows music through the opening]
Plankton: Ugh, nagging Neptune, the agony! [exclaiming]
[SpongeBob drags the bottle against the fence and laughs.]
Plankton: [bouncing around in the bottle due to fence-dragging] Whatever's happening, I'm sure it will be over soon.
[SpongeBob continues dragging the bottle against the fence, which appears to be extended for a long stretch of road, as he walks down the street. SpongeBob enters his house and shows Gary, who was watching the sports channel, the bottle.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, huh?
Gary: [hits the bottle] Meow.
SpongeBob: [laughs and pushes the bottle] Huh?
Gary: [hits the bottle again] Meow.
SpongeBob: [laughs and pushes the bottle] Ooh.
Gary: [slithers back to the TV and sighs] Meow.
SpongeBob: Hey, there's writing on this. [reading the inscription] "Rub bottle for magic genie." Magic genie! I found a genie!
[SpongeBob rubs the bottle real hard and it becomes red hot.]
Plankton: Ow, ow, hot, hot, hot, ow, ow, ow!
[Plankton pops out of the bottle in a blaze of fire.]
Plankton: Yeow! Alakazam! I am the genie of the bottle. [exclaiming from the burns]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! Hi, genie! Are you really a genie?
Plankton: Of course I am. Now, as a genie, I command you to take me to Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [giggles] You silly genie, you. You know it doesn't work like that. I'm your master now, and you have to grant me three wishes.
Plankton: What? For cryin' out loud. All right, what would you like?
SpongeBob: Oh, nothing for me, thank you. That would be selfish. But I will make three wishes for my friends. Friendship is magical too.
Plankton: I'm gonna be sick.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Plankton at the front door of Squidward's house. SpongeBob knocks on the door with the bottle.]
Plankton: Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Squidward: What do you want? It's my day off!
SpongeBob: Well now it's your lucky day off. Make a wish, and the genie shall make it come true.
Squidward: Anything to get you away. I wish I for a golden clarinet that always plays beautifully. There.
SpongeBob: [to Plankton] Say it. Mm!
Plankton: [sighs] Your wish is my command! [claps his hands and disappears]
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: So we're done? [slams the door]
SpongeBob: Huh? Genie? [looks in the bottle]
[Plankton paints Squidward's clarinet with gold paint. Then he kicks the paint bucket into the trash can and hides in the clarinet.]
Squidward: [notices the gold-painted clarinet] Well, I'll be an ocean monkey's uncle. The wish came true!
[Squidward blows through the gold-painted clarinet and makes mysterious but beautiful music. Plankton, who is inside the clarinet, is helping Squidward play the notes correctly.]
Plankton: [panting] Good thing I spent that last summer in evil band camp.
[Squidward stops playing music and puts down his clarinet. He now has gold paint all over his mouth and hands.]
Squidward: Oh, magic is real.
[Plankton runs out of Squidward's house and onto SpongeBob's head.]
Plankton: Oh, Master? I have an idea! How about your next friend is Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: My next friend is my best friend.
Plankton: Oh, for cod's sake.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Plankton at Patrick's house. Patrick is trying to decide what his wish will be.]
Patrick: I wish...I wish...I wish...
Plankton: Pick something, you bozo!
Patrick: Well, sometimes I wish I had an extra head so that I'd have someone to talk to when you're at work.
SpongeBob: Aww.
Plankton: Pathetic. All right, your crummy wish is my command! Give me your hand, Jumbo. And the both of you, close your eyes.
[Patrick holds up his left hand as he and SpongeBob close their eyes. Plankton draws a doodle on Patrick's hand with a marker, making him giggle.]
Plankton: Alakazam!
Patrick: [notices the doodle on his hand] Oh! My extra head! It's my wish come true! Oh, I'm gonna call you... Noggin.
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Noggin. Nice to meet you.
Patrick: Noggin, say hello to SpongeBob. [silence]
SpongeBob: Oh, he doesn't have to—
Patrick: Noggin, you're embarrassing me. Say hello to SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No, it's okay, Patrick.
Patrick: No, it's not okay!
Plankton: Leaping lungfish, can we go now?
Patrick: Yes, go! Noggin here needs to be taught a painful lesson.
[SpongeBob and Plankton leave as Patrick enters his house.]
Patrick: Okay, Mister, you can—ow! [Sounds of fighting and struggle] Ooh-ho-ho-ho! What are you do—? Ow, ow! Ow, Noggin, don't! Oh!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Plankton arriving at the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: Finally! The Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Of course, I was saving my last wish for good ol' Mr. Krabs.
Plankton: Ooh, izzy wizzy, let's get busy. [giggles]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob talking to Mr. Krabs in his office.]
SpongeBob: And so this would be the third and last wish I have, and it's all for you.
[SpongeBob puts the bottle on Mr. Krabs' desk and opens it. Plankton pops out of the bottle with his magic dust.]
Plankton: Alakazam!
[Mr. Krabs doesn't care and pushes the bottle aside.]
Mr. Krabs: Child, can't you see I'm working here? [holds up clipboard with a word search on it. Comically, the words found are different words for money.] Take your toy and go play in the kitchen.
SpongeBob: [teary eyed] But it's a real genie, and I—I saved the last wish for you. [sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, stop your blubbering. I'll play along. I wish I had, um, $1,000.
Plankton: Your wish is my command! [quietly] You greedy crook. [disappears]
[Plankton is now at the First Nautical Bank.]
Plankton: I'd like to withdraw all my money, please.
[The cash register dings and Plankton runs out with $1,000. Plankton runs back to Mr. Krabs' office, puts the money on his desk, and goes back in the bottle.]
Mr. Krabs: [notices the money and gasps] Well, blow me down. It is a real genie! If I possess that bottle, I'll get three more wishes!
Squidward: [grabs the bottle] It's mine now! With three wishes, I could rule the music world!
[Squidward runs out with the bottle to the exit of the restaurant. But Patrick, who is now wearing bandages, trips him with his foot and grabs the bottle.]
Squidward: [gets up] What happened to you?
Patrick: I don't wanna talk about it. I just want a new Noggin.
[Mr. Krabs punches Patrick and grabs the bottle.]
Mr. Krabs: Got it! Nyah, nyah, the genie's mine now!
[Mr. Krabs goes to run back in his restaurant. SpongeBob comes out and sees a penny.]
SpongeBob: Hey, look, a penny!
Mr. Krabs: What? Money? Where? Ooh. [giggles]
[SpongeBob snatches the bottle as Mr. Krabs picks up the penny and puts it in his coin slot on his back. He turns around and is now in a bloodthirsty rage.]
Mr. Krabs: You hand me that bottle!
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs! Oh, don't you all see? We shouldn't be fighting. Today we found out that magic is real. And that magic is magical and that magic makes you feel all sparkly and [quirrkily shakes bottle] carbonated inside.
[Plankton vomits in the bottle.]
Squidward: So how do we decide who gets the genie?
SpongeBob: That's easy. We're gonna play a little game called Spin The Bottle! [spins the bottle and Plankton screams inside]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs and Squidward sitting on the floor in the middle of the restaurant.]
SpongeBob: So the rules are whichever one the bottle points to...
Patrick: Has to kiss!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, they will win the bottle.
[Patrick goes to put lipstick on, but stops immediately.]
Patrick: Oh.
SpongeBob: And spin!
[SpongeBob spins the bottle. Plankton tries to hold his mouth shut to prevent himself from vomiting.]
Squidward: [nervously] Ooh, ooh...
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] Mm...
[Patrick laughs.]
Mr. Krabs: Stop on me, stop on me...
[The bottle stops on Squidward.]
Squidward: It's mine, it's mine!
[Plankton cheats the game as he moves the bottle to Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: It's coming back! It's coming to me! Yes, it's mine! Whoo-hoo! [grabs the bottle, pushes Squidward, runs to the kitchen, and opens the bottle] All right, [rubs the bottle] abracadabra! [shakes the bottle] Hocus pocus! [shakes the bottle over his right hand] Open sesame!
[Plankton, who is liquefied, falls out of the bottle.]
Plankton: [gets up and feels dizzy] Al—Alakazoom! Your swish is my com—my com— [claps his hands] ♪My wishy wishy wishy wish fish!♪ [blows raspberry and tosses sparkles]
Mr. Krabs: All right, Alakazam, first thing I want is for everything in the Krusty Krab to turn into gold—even all the negative space.
Plankton: [rips off his genie costume] I can't do it! I can't keep up this charade anymore. I'm too mangled and mutilated!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I should have known! What was your lame-o plan this time?
Plankton: [sighs] I was gonna break that bottle so you would have to put me in the bottle with the secret formula.
[Suddenly, a cloud of purple magic dust erupts in the kitchen. In the midst of the magic, a real genie appears and he's not very happy.]
Genie: [grabs the bottle] So you were gonna break my bottle, eh? That's the last time I go on vacation and sublet my bottle to someone without references! [thunder claps] What did you do to it? It's all chipped and scratched!
Plankton: Calm down, you're insured.
[Squidward bursts in the kitchen.]
Squidward: Who's this clod with my bottle?
[Patrick bursts in the kitchen as well.]
Patrick: Who's that bottle with my clod?
[Patrick pushes Squidward aside and goes to reach for the genie's bottle.]
Genie: Hmm...
[The genie is outraged at Squidward, Patrick, Mr. Krabs and Plankton and sees that their greed, lust, and selfishness over his bottle had desecrated him and his powers.]
Genie: [thunder rumbles] So you all like bottles, eh?!
[The genie uses his powers to grab an empty ketchup bottle from the trashcan. Then he shrinks Squidward, Patrick, Mr. Krabs and Plankton in a smaller size and stuffs them in the bottle as punishment for their greed. He closes the bottle with a lid and drops it on the floor.]
Genie: [kisses his bottle] Oh, poor baby. Next time I'll take you with me to visit Mama.
[The genie snaps his fingers and disappears with his bottle. SpongeBob comes in the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Hey, you guys, I—huh? Hmm, guess they worked it out. It's so heartwarming to live in a world with real magic. And the greatest magic of all is the way my friends are so close to each other.
[The ketchup bottle containing SpongeBob's friends rolls over to SpongeBob. SpongeBob picks up the bottle.]
Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, and Patrick: SpongeBob, will you get us out of here?! [exclaiming and shouting for help to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Yuck, this bottle of ketchup's gone bad. [throws the bottle in the trashcan with his friends inside]


[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is peeking through his window with his binoculars.]
SpongeBob: [imitates static and talks through walkie-talkie] This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob, reporting to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick. [imitates static] There are no signs of crime in front of my house. Any criminal activity by you? Over. [imitates static]
[At Patrick's house, Patrick is also peeking around with his binoculars.]
Patrick: [imitates static and talks through walkie-talkie] Uh...I've got a visual on an old lady tying her shoes. [slides down his house; whispers] She's doing the old granny knot.
Old Lady: Oh, I'll give you a granny knot!
Patrick: [grunts as he flips over] All clear! No crime here.
[The old lady snatches the wallet from Patrick's pocket with her teeth and hops away. Squidward walks out of his house with luggage.]
SpongeBob: [imitates static] Patrick, emergency meeting at Squidward's house—ASAP! [he and Patrick stop in front of Squidward on their knees] Oh please, Squidward, don't move away! You can't leave the neighborhood! Aw, we were just starting to get close. [whimpers]
Patrick: [grabs Squidward and hugs him tightly; he inhales] I swear, I'll haunt your nightmares if you move away!
Squidward: [pushes Patrick away] I'm not moving away, you brainless bottom feeders!
[SpongeBob and Patrick suck and eat the sand like bottom feeders.]
Squidward: I'm just taking a week's vacation away from you morons.
SpongeBob: [squeals as he jumps in Squidward's arms and whispers in his ear] Thank you.
[Squidward drops SpongeBob to the ground.]
SpongeBob: [grabs Squidward's suitcase] Let me help you carry this.
Squidward: No—wait, no!
[SpongeBob and Squidward pull the suitcase open and all of Squidward's belongings fly everywhere.]
SpongeBob: [removes underwear off his head] Oh—your unmentionables.
[Squidward swats the underwear away in anger.]
Patrick: I won't mention this bra.
Squidward: It's not a bra! It's a pectoral girdle. I don't care about my clothes. I just wanna get away from you two. And while I'm away—huh...
[Patrick tries on some of Squidward's clothes, but it rips onto SpongeBob's face. Squidward gets really angry and his head explodes like a bomb.]
Squidward: [packs his suitcase] While I am gone, there will be a paying guest renting my place. Don't bother him! [leaves]
[The scene changes to a taxi pulling up at Squidward's house.]
SpongeBob: [imitates static and talks through walkie-talkie] This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick. I've got a visual on a cab. Can you get a make on who the passenger is? Over. [imitates static]
Patrick: [imitates static and talks through walkie-talkie, but is blindfolded by Squidward's pectoral girdle] I can't see anything through these unmentionables. [imitates static]
[The passenger comes out of the taxi, which turns out to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis, Man Ray.]
TV Announcer: Who's this tacky tourist turning up in taxi? Why, it's none other than that mortal enemy of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, the evil Man Ray!
Man Ray: Hey, dude, keep it down. I'm not doing any evil this week. I'm on vacation!
TV Announcer: Really?
Man Ray: Yes, really. [hums cheerfully as he enters Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Aw, he went inside! Patrick, wouldn't it be great to have another friend who could join our Junior Crime Breakers? Ooh, I gotta get a look at him!
Patrick: [squeals quietly] We can blast him out. [holds up a huge TNT dynamite]
SpongeBob: No, no! Squidward said not to bother the man. [Patrick throws away the dynamite] So, we gotta be sneaky.
[SpongeBob and Patrick sneak behind Squidward's house to take a look at Man Ray. Patrick pounds on the window.]
SpongeBob: Shh! He must've gone upstairs.
[SpongeBob and Patrick run back to the front of Squidward's house.]
Patrick: Well, how do we get up there?
SpongeBob: "Eye" have just the thing! [giggles and grabs his right eye] Ow!
[SpongeBob swings his eye, throws it, and ties it to an open window. Inside, Man Ray is sleeping on Squidward's chair and feels a cold breeze of wind.]
Man Ray: [shivers] Oh, it's getting chilly.
SpongeBob: [Man Ray slams the window on SpongeBob's eye] Ow! [groans weakly; Man Ray slams the window on SpongeBob's eye again] D'ow! [SpongeBob pulls his eye down to avoid getting slammed on by the window] Ow! [SpongeBob reels his eye back on his face] Oof! [his eye is completely flat like a pancake; he yelps when he blinks it] Ow.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick ringing the doorbell while bringing a pie.]
SpongeBob: Now, I know Squidward said not to bother his guest, but there's nothing wrong with a welcome-to-the-neighborhood pie. [giggling squeals]
Man Ray: [answers the door] Oh! May I help you? I was just finishing up in the bathroom.
SpongeBob: [hands Man Ray the pie] Hello. Welcome to the neighborhood! [enters Squidward's house]
Patrick: Don't mind us. [enters Squidward's house]
Man Ray: Wha...Hmm. [closes the door]
[SpongeBob and Patrick each take a seat in two of Squidward's furniture. One of which Patrick breaks.]
Man Ray: Is this sand?
Patrick: Hamper sand—from my hamper.
Man Ray: [quietly] Ugh!
SpongeBob: Yeah, stranger, we got a nice little town here—thanks to the Junior Crime Breakers. And we're always looking for new members. You look pretty fit.
Patrick: SpongeBob. He's not putting out any snacks for us.
Man Ray: Oh, sorry! How rude of me. Hmm...ooh! All I have is this pie.
Patrick: Don't mind if I do.
[Patrick grabs the sand pie, eats it, and swallows it. After swallowing it, he smiles and sand falls out from his teeth.]
Man Ray: Eh—if you'll excuse me, I'll finish up in the bathroom. [heads upstairs]
Patrick: [pants] He's all outta snacks! [throws the pie plate away] Let's go.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we haven't asked him to join the Junior Crime Breakers yet. Hello, we were wondering if you'd like to—[screams]
[SpongeBob pulls out his comic book and frantically looks through the pages. He realizes that the paying guest that is renting Squidward's house is actually Man Ray. Man Ray is finishing sprucing himself up in the bathroom.]
Patrick: [quietly] Evil villain Man Ray.
[SpongeBob and Patrick run out.]
Man Ray: Now, what were you saying? [notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are gone] Hmm? What? Hmm? [shrugs his shoulders] Hmm.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick running to Shady Shoals Rest Home. They enter Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's room.]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man! It's Man Ray! He's right inside Squidward's...place. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy appear to be resting in frozen capsules] Too late. Man Ray must've gotten to them.
Patrick: [whimpers] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy ice pops! They finally made them! [goes to lick Mermaid Man's capsule]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, Patrick. We're both wrong! It says right here in issue 55. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are just taking their cryonic nap. But when they wake up in a week, they'll be weak for a week! [SpongeBob leaps towards Patrick] Patrick, do you know what this means?
Patrick: I'll have to wait a week for my Mermaid Man ice pop?
SpongeBob: Yes and no. It means that you and I will have to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and stop Man Ray's vacation of...[thunder claps] Evil!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [grabs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's rings] By the power of Neptune, Mermaid Pants and Barnacle Star unite!
[SpongeBob and Patrick unite the rings and disappear in a loud explosion. The results of the explosion causes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to abruptly wake up from their cryonic nap. The scene changes to SpongeBob as Mermaid Pants and Patrick as Barnacle Star climbing up to a window on a stack of trash cans. Patrick is seen licking Mermaid Man's frozen arm.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, is that...
Patrick: I couldn't wait a week! [throws away Mermaid Man's frozen arm and he and SpongeBob resume climbing] Yow!
[SpongeBob reaches the top, but Patrick pushes SpongeBob off. Patrick grabs SpongeBob, pulls him back up and hangs him on the window. Patrick then begins to lose his balance.]
Patrick: Ah-ah-ah— [sobbing]
[Man Ray is sleeping on the couch inside, unaware of what SpongeBob and Patrick are up to.]
Patrick: Good thing I'm so stealthy, huh, Mermaid Pants? [loses his balance] Ah! The stealth!
[Patrick falls but grabs onto SpongeBob's feet. Soon, all of the trash cans fall and crash.]
Man Ray: [wakes up] Huh? [opens the door] Hmm? [shrugs his shoulders] Hmm! [closes the door]
[Patrick climbs up to the window and pulls himself and SpongeBob inside.]
SpongeBob: Ow!
[SpongeBob and Patrick do their action poses. Patrick accidentally kicks SpongeBob and sends him crashing into a bookshelf, causing a huge ruckus heard from downstairs.]
Man Ray: Intruders? Mm-hmm...I've got to call the cops. [dials the number, but stops] What am I doing? Villains don't call the police! [sighs] I didn't think to bring any evil super-weapons on vacation! I'm unarmed! [hears loud noise] Huh?
[The ceiling cracks.]
SpongeBob: [looking through a lava lamp] Who'da thunk that Squidward would be stockpiling such a huge arsenal of evil super-weapons? [throws away the lava lamp and bites into some stale cookies until his teeth shatter] So stale, yet so deadly.
[Patrick steps back and trips over a bowling ball. He lands on one of Squidward's pictures and gets it caught in his buttocks.]
Patrick: I got my weapon!
[Patrick pulls the picture out from his butt. Man Ray grabs an umbrella, hoping to find a weapon strong enough to fight. SpongeBob and Patrick attempt to sing their theme song, but they fall down the stairs and land in front of Man Ray.]
SpongeBob: [gets up along with Patrick] ♪Dum-dah-dah!♪
Man Ray: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? I knew you guys were old, but I had no idea you mutated.
SpongeBob: Surrender, Man Ray!
Man Ray: I'm on holiday.
SpongeBob: Yeah, an evil holiday!
Patrick: Prepare to be framed! [grunts as he throws the broken picture at Man Ray]
[Man Ray opens up the umbrella and sends the broken picture crashing into a vase.]
TV Announcer: Vase vaporized!
SpongeBob: Here's a dessert that's sure to hurt! [throws the stale cookies at Man Ray like ninja shurikens]
Man Ray: Huh?
[Man Ray dodges the stale cookies and all of Squidward's figurines get fractured.]
TV Announcer: Figurines fractured!
[Man Ray flips over a sofa. The sofa crashes onto SpongeBob and Patrick and sends them dangling on the edge of Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick climb back in and continue the fight. Man Ray swings Patrick around and around.]
Patrick: No, no, no, no, no!
[Man Ray sends Patrick flying into Squidward's clarinet collection. Three clarinets lodge onto SpongeBob's head.]
SpongeBob: All right, Man Ray. I will snare you in my "clara-net!" [inhales and blows really loud music through the clarinets]
[Man Ray gets pushed by the supersonic waves of the clarinet's music.]
Man Ray: [grunts, shouts] Oof!
Patrick: [inhales purposely] Uh...I can't think of anything!
[Patrick charges towards Man Ray and attacks him while holding onto his head, causing him to fall over and break a table.]
TV Announcer: Table toppled!
[Outside Squidward's house, the sky is roaring with thunder and the clouds are pitch black. Man Ray jumps through the roof and throws SpongeBob and Patrick out.]
Man Ray: I just wanted a vacation!
SpongeBob: Evil never takes a vacation!
Man Ray: [stammers] Did you just make that up? Because that sounds pretty good. Do you mind if I use it sometime?
SpongeBob: Help yourself, Man Ray.
Patrick: Yeah, help yourself to pain! [thunder claps]
Man Ray: [face palms himself and groans] Why did I ever bother trying to be normal? [rips off his tourist clothing] I am Man Ray! Feel my evil wrath!
[Man Ray, SpongeBob and Patrick charge towards each other for their final battle. However, the loud thunder clap scares them and sends them falling through the roof and crashing into the kitchen. The phone rings.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Man Ray: Huh?
Man Ray: Hold on. I should get this. [answers phone] Hello?
Squidward: Hello, Man Ray? The weather changed my plans. I'm coming home. [grunts as the wind attempts to pull him] Not to worry, though. You'll get a full refund on the rent, so long as there is no damage to my place. [Man Ray hangs up] Hello?
Man Ray: [laughs evilly] That idiot octopus doesn't know I gave him a phony check! [smashes the phone with his fist and heads out the door] You were right about me after all, dopey duo. Evil never takes a vacation!
SpongeBob: Ooh! Definitely sounds a lot cooler when he says it.
Man Ray: [hears a horn honking] Ah, here's my Scuber. [runs out, climbs on the scuba-diver and drives away]
SpongeBob: Maybe one day Man Ray will reform and join the Junior Crime Breakers. [gets hit in the head by a board] Huh?
[Squidward's house is completely trashed up from the battle.]
Patrick: Man, he really trashed this place.
SpongeBob: Okay, Barnacle Star! Let's be super good and glue all of Squidward's stuff back together!
Patrick: Well, how do we do that?
SpongeBob: [chuckling] Oh, Patrick, it's right here in issue 14. [slurps] We have super saliva!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob gluing all of Squidward's stuff with their saliva. SpongeBob glues a clarinet together with his saliva.]
Patrick: [glues a cactus together with his saliva] Ow!
[SpongeBob glues some stairs together with his saliva. Patrick wrings out saliva from his tongue and dumps it in a bucket. Then he throws the bucket of saliva onto some broken furniture and magically repairs them. Moments later, Squidward enters the house.]
Squidward: Hello? [his house is all cleaned and fixed up] Oh, looks like my guest left already. [sighs] Home sweet... [slams the door and his house crumbles; he pops up from the rubble with a brick in his mouth, groaning] Home.


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. There is a long line of customers who are growing tired and impatient from Bubble Bass's order.]
Customers: Just go! Oh, no.
Bubble Bass: Yes, I will have a quad patty, with a sprinkling of Himalayan salt, smoked paprika, and micro greens.
Squidward: Gimme a quad—
Bubble Bass: Hold on. I'm not finished with my order.
Customers: Aw, come on! [some of them turn and leave]
Bubble Bass: I would like my patties be-cheesed, but not just any cheese will do. Have you any aged gouda? [the customers grumble] And yes, it is pronounced "how-uda," not "goo-da."
Mr. Krabs: [growls and taps Bubble Bass's shoulder] Just eat the regular Krabby Patty [shoves a Krabby Patty in Bubble Bass's mouth] and stop wasting everybody's time!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! You know we don't treat our customers like that. [Mr. Krabs is stunned] It says right here, in the Krusty Krab manual. [clears throat and reads] "The customer is always right, when they have money."
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Such wise and beautiful words. Thanks for reminding me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I'm here to serve, Mr. Krabs. [accidentally splatters a dropping of ketchup on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: [growls and screams] Ketchup waster! [SpongeBob whimpers] Oh! Sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't mean it. No more outbursts. I'll be nice Mr. Krabs, I promise.
Squidward: Your napkin. [gives Bubble Bass a napkin, but drops it]
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Waster!
[Mr. Krabs jumps into the cashier boat, but Squidward climbs out and runs away. Mr. Krabs gives Squidward a chase around the restaurant as he rows the cashier boat. Squidward steps on SpongeBob as he runs.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? [gets run over by Mr. Krabs and the cashier boat] Ow! Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob grabs the cashier boat and his lower half follows] You gotta calm down!
[Mr. Krabs continues to chase Squidward all over the restaurant while dragging SpongeBob. During the chase, SpongeBob's arm entangles everything and every one of the customers inside. Moments later, Larry the Lobster enters the restaurant. Squidward hides behind Larry. Mr. Krabs crashes into Larry.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! [SpongeBob shouts as he crashes into Larry as well. Mr. Krabs, with SpongeBob on his back, and Squidward climb around Larry] I'll murder-lize him!
Larry: Relax, little crab guy.
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Get your muscled mitts off me! Get off! Get...[sighs happily]
Larry: That's right. Give in to the healing power of my pecs.
SpongeBob: I feel so secure.
Larry: [sighs] All better?
Squidward: What? You let him go? We're all dead! [shouts, crawls into the kitchen and gets burned by the grill] Ow! The grill's still on! [runs out of the kitchen and screams as he is burnt from the grill; SpongeBob splashes Squidward with water; Squidward slips and crashes into the table where Larry and Mr. Krabs are sitting in.]
Mr. Krabs: I don't know what's wrong with me. The Krusty Krab's just been so busy. I never seem to get a break.
Larry: Sounds like someone needs a vacation.
Mr. Krabs: I—I could use some me time.
SpongeBob: And don't worry. Squidward and I can take care of the Krusty Krab while you're gone.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm...
[Mr. Krabs imagines the Krusty Krab completely burnt down with SpongeBob standing in the middle.]
SpongeBob: Order up! [the patty disintegrates]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] I'm sorry, but I can't leave you guys in charge. I need a strong man to run this place—someone who's a rock and can really handle the load, you know? But who has that kind of strength, hmm?
[While Mr. Krabs is talking, Larry lifts him up and down with his claw.]
SpongeBob: Psst, psst! [points to Larry as he stammers excitedly]
Mr. Krabs: That's it! Larry, how would you like to manage the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation?
Larry: Larry's got his own gym to run.
SpongeBob: Come on, Larry. It'll be fun.
Larry: Larry loves fun! I'm in.
Mr. Krabs: All right! Ah! [gives Larry a high-five, but his claw hits Squidward; he groans]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob continuing his work at the grill. Larry enters the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Larry. How you liking your new job?
Larry: Larry likes it just fine. But do the customers always eat like this?
[The customers obnoxiously eat their meals.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no. They normally eat like this! [grabs the patties from the grill and chews heavily on them]
Larry: Those poor people. Someone needs to whip them into shape.
[SpongeBob continues to chew heavily on the patties. He smiles as meat seeps through his teeth. The scene changes to Squidward taking a customer's order.]
Squidward: What'll you have?
Fred: Uh...I'll have a double Krabby Patty, Krabby fries, and uh—whoa! [gets grabbed by Larry and is put on a treadmill]
Squidward: What else?
Fred: Uh, uh—a Krabby soda...Uh, uh—a Krabby...[slips and falls off the treadmill] My leg!
Squidward: [laughs and gets strapped by a stretching band with a motor] Hey! [voice warbling] Can I help you?
Frank: [runs on treadmill] Yeah, I'll take a Krabby salad, dressing on the side, and 60 more minutes on this rad treadmill. [hands Squidward a dollar]
Squidward: [warbling] Here's your change.
[The scene changes to Larry putting a patty on a weight.]
Larry: Here's your order, sir. [gives it to Octavius Rex] And don't forget your side salad! [gives it to Octavius Rex, but the weights are too heavy for him to carry]
Frank: Yeah! Push it, push it!
Larry: Push it, push it!
Octavius Rex: [grunts] Okay, okay. I'll push it. [pushes the weights to the table]
Larry: Push it, push it!
Frank: Yeah, push it!
[Octavius Rex pushes the weight onto the table.]
SpongeBob: Yes, you made it! Now, claim your Krabby Patty!
Octavius Rex: [weakly] Hooray...[drops his face on the salad]
SpongeBob: Aww, too pooped for a Krabby Patty.
Larry: Ah, forget Krabby Patties. Those things are over. [throws away the patty]
SpongeBob: But Larry, Krabby Patties are why people come here.
Larry: Ooh, not anymore. Now we only serve salads and protein power shakes!
SpongeBob: Ooh, power shake! I wanna taste. [takes a sip of the power shake, but spits it out onto the radio as it tasted terrible]
Larry: You like?
SpongeBob: No, Larry. No.
Larry: But it gets you jacked!
SpongeBob: I don't wanna be jacked. I just want my Krabby Patties back.
Larry: Everybody wants to get jacked.
Frank: Yeah, jacked!
[Larry and Frank buff themselves up and show off their muscles.]
SpongeBob: Look, Larry, I really think we should go back to serving Krabby Patties. People love the...
[Larry exhales and relaxes.]
SpongeBob: Larry?
Larry: [stammers] Jacked.
[The scene changes to Larry make some serious changes to the Krusty Krab. He turns the entire dining room into an obstacle course for the customers to run through. SpongeBob and Squidward are serving power shakes while customers run through the course.]
Larry: SpongeBob! Squidward! Let's move it, boys. Get those power shakes out and those heart rates up!
[SpongeBob and Squidward run to serve the power shakes to the customers. SpongeBob climbs the rope and serves the shake to Nat Peterson on the rock-climbing wall. But one of the shakes drops onto Nat Peterson and sends him falling off.]
SpongeBob: Sorry!
[Squidward jumps over some hurdles, but almost gets stepped on by Martin. He laughs in relief, but gets himself squashed by Bubble Bass.]
Squidward: Whoa!
Bubble Bass: [tastes the power shake] Oh! Horrible sustenance.
[SpongeBob cowers behind some weights as everyone in the Krusty Krab is being tortured and pummeled by the strong guys. It soon dawns on SpongeBob that Larry is literally turning the Krusty Krab into a gym. Squidward hides behind the weights with SpongeBob.]
Squidward: Let's get outta here!
[Squidward and SpongeBob run over to a rope net.]
SpongeBob: Pardon my reach.
[Squidward climbs over the rope net, but gets himself tangled in it. SpongeBob struggles to pull Squidward off.]
Squidward: Go on without me! [SpongeBob runs, but is grabbed by Squidward] No, wait, don't.
SpongeBob: Squidward, I know Larry means well, but he's messing up the Krusty Krab! This used to be a shrine to the delicious Krabby Patty. Now it's just a stinky gym.
Larry: [to Fred as he is doing weight-lifting with a salt shaker] Feel...the...burn!
[Fred lifts the barbell high. SpongeBob sprays some deodorant spray on Fred's armpit. The barbell drops on Fred's head and salt spills on his salad plate.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, go tell Larry he's fired.
Squidward: Are you crazy? He is way too big for that. We need to come at this another way—a smart, dignified way! I know—we'll sabotage the place. [a strong guy passes by, drinking a power shake] And I know just where to start: the power shakes.
SpongeBob: I'm on it! [giggles and runs off to the kitchen]
Squidward: Wait, wait—what about me?
SpongeBob: [adds butter to the blender] Butter! [adds lard to the blender] Lard! [adds mayonnaise to the blender] Mayonnaise. [grunts happily as he closes the blender lid]
[SpongeBob turns on the blender and all the ingredients blend together. Once it's done, SpongeBob scoops up some of the mixed up ingredients with a cup and dips it into the fryer.]
SpongeBob: And now, fry it all up into a greasy, heart-stopping surprise! [goes to serve the shake to Larry] Here you go.
[But instead of drinking it, Larry spreads the shake all over his pecs and rubs it like suntan lotion.]
Larry: I'm loving this oily concoction. It really makes Larry's muscles pop! [buffs up, grabs SpongeBob and rubs him over his pecs] Thanks, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob groans while being rubbed against Larry's pecs. SpongeBob slides off Larry and slides over to Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Okay, that failed. What now?
Squidward: We'll sabotage the weight machines. Then these muscle heads will have to find a new place to work out!
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [runs off]
Squidward: Wait, you idiot! Get me out of here.
[SpongeBob loosens up some nuts and bolts to make one of the weight-lifting machines fragile. Once he was done, Frank comes over to do some work out. He gets himself tangled in the weight machine, but the machine made him become stronger, even though SpongeBob sabotaged it. Frank breaks free and shows off his muscles.]
Frank: Awesome workout, bro!
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess this place belongs to the gym guys now. [takes off his hat and leaves]
Squidward: Don't leave me, SpongeBob! Wait, what am I saying?
[Outside, customers are crawling everywhere, dying of hunger.]
Customers: Help us! [groans and moans] Hungry!
[Sandals gnaws on his arm and Bubble Bass eats some sand.]
SpongeBob: What are you all doing out here? You should just go home.
Harold: We can't go home. There's no Krabby Patties at home. I need my Krabby Patties, man! [wailing] You gotta help me!
Customers: Help us! Help! Help!
SpongeBob: Krabby Patties—that's it! Those gym guys have forgotten the simple, greasy pleasure of munching on a Krabby Patty, and we need to remind them.
[The scene changes back inside. Larry and some other strong guys are doing some workouts, when suddenly, they hear something in the kitchen.]
Larry and the gym guys: Huh?
[The door opens. SpongeBob, Bubble Bass and the angry customers confront Larry and his gym guys.]
Larry: SpongeBob, you're ruining Larry's pump sesh.
SpongeBob: Larry, you're ruining the Krusty Krab!
Larry: Get 'em, men!
[Larry's gym guys charge at the customers.]
SpongeBob: Fire!
[The customers fire Krabby Patties with their slingshots. The patties fly into the mouths of the gym guys and they start eating them.]
Gym Guys: Mmm!
Frank: [growls as he corners Bubble Bass] Get over here! [Bubble Bass turns around and SpongeBob shots a patty in Frank's mouth] Mmm. Oh, gimme, gimme! [eats a platter of patties from Gus]
Squidward: Give him a single! Give him a double with cheese! [gets splattered in the face by a patty]
[Nat Peterson does his ninja-like moves while using ketchup and mustard bottles as nunchackus. Nat Peterson jumps in the air and SpongeBob swings on a rope, serving Krabby Patties to the gym guys.]
SpongeBob: Yeah!
[Nat Peterson sprays ketchup and mustard on the patties.]
Gym Guys: Huh? [munches on the patties]
SpongeBob: Give into the flavor, Larry!
Larry: [fights off with his barbells] Never!
SpongeBob: He's too fast. We need a distraction. [pulls out a barbell from his head] Here, use this. [gives it to Bubble Bass and he does some weight-lifting]
Larry: No, you gotta keep your elbow—[SpongeBob shoots a Krabby Patty into Larry's mouth and he chews on it; SpongeBob blows on his slingshot and Larry eventually gives in as he swallows the patty] Oh! Greasy, fatty, sticky, and gummy! It's delicious! Larry's been a fool. I've spent all my time working on my muscles when I could've been working on these delicious sandwiches. [sobbing] What's—what's wrong with me? [his pecs cry]
Bubble Bass: Now those are some sad pecs.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Larry] Aw, don't be sad, Larry. You were just trying to help people get into shape. [hands Larry a tissue and his pecs blow into it; three of Larry's gym guys eat Krabby Patties, but gain weight] Eh—looks like your gym has some new customers.
[The scene changes to Larry and the gym guys carrying their workout equipment out of the Krusty Krab. Squidward, on the other hand, is still tangled up in the rope net.]
Squidward: Somebody let me out of this thing already!
Mr. Krabs: [singing as he comes back from his vacation] Home sweet home. [enters the restaurant] Hmm?
[All of the customers including Patrick are gobbling down the Krabby Patties and things are now back to normal at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Order up! [slingshots a patty to Fred]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs happily] Everything's just how I left it.


[The episode begins on a dark and spooky, Halloween night. Jellyfishes fly out of an old, sunken ship with bat-wigs and fly towards Bikini Bottom. In the city, trick-or-treaters are walking in the streets with costumes and everyone is having a great time.]
Trick-Or-Treater 1: I wanted to be Mermaid Man this year.
Trick-Or-Treater 2: Trick or treat.
[On a rooftop of a building, one citizen is putting a ghost-shaped balloon on the roof.]
Citizen: I love Halloween. [gets zapped by the jellyfish] Whoa! [falls off the roof]
[The jellyfish fly over to SpongeBob's house, where SpongeBob is putting up decorations for Halloween.]
SpongeBob: Ah! [takes out glitter from his pocket and blows it on the banner] Hm... Mm-hm. It's scary, but... [adds more glitter on the house until it is sparkly; then he cuts the banner in half, making it look like the word, "Hallo"; just then, the jellyfish fly over to SpongeBob.] Oh. Hello. [pulls out a Halloween cookie and laughs; the jellyfish eat the cookie and they zap him; SpongeBob screams; the jellyfish leave and SpongeBob waves goodbye; then he slides down the ladder to take a look at his house] Hm...
[At that same moment, Patrick, who is wearing a knight costume, comes by.]
Patrick: Hello!
SpongeBob: Hello, Sir Patrick. How do you like my decorations?
[Patrick flips open his helmet to look at SpongeBob's house.]
Patrick: Those are too cute for Halloween, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, Halloween is cute. Sharing candy, holding hands, singing songs. It's a bright and cheery time of year.
Patrick: I thought it was about getting your pants scared off. Hey, where's your costume?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Close your eyes. [Patrick closes his helmet and SpongeBob turns around to put on his costume] Okay. Open 'em. [Patrick peeks his eyes through his helmet and sees that SpongeBob's costume is literally a flower] ♪I'm a lovely flower♪ Ooh...
Patrick: Oh, that's not scary either, SpongeBob. Wait, I'll show you what scary is. [picks up SpongeBob and carries him to Squidward's house while SpongeBob laughs]
Trick-Or-Treaters: Let's go to this house.
[The trick or treaters walk up to Squidward's house.]
Squidward: [spectrally] Oh... There is no candy here...
Trick-Or-Treater 3: What?
Squidward: Only onions! [rolls onions out of his house] Now move along. Ooh...
[The trick-or-treaters flee from Squidward's house.]
Patrick: No candy. That is so scary. Right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob? [Patrick feels a rattling motion in his costume; he opens it and finds SpongeBob hiding in it] SpongeBob, why are you hiding in there? You'll miss all the scary stuff.
SpongeBob: I don't want to see the scary stuff, Patrick. Okay? I admit it. I love trick-or-treating, but I am too afraid to go out on Halloween!
Patrick: SpongeBob, don't you know the old saying? "The only thing you have to fear is..." [thinks for a second] Yourself! [looks in the mirror] Aah! Stop staring at me like that! No! [puts his mirror down] See? It's all in your head, SpongeBob. You just have to remember one simple trick, and that is: scary equals funny.
SpongeBob: Scary equals funny. Hm. Never looked at it that way before. [pulls himself out of Patrick's costume] Doink. All right. I'll go out. [sees the ghost balloon floating by and screams]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Here I am. [reveals himself hiding in Patrick's mouth; he shivers] Just looking for cavities. Nope. None here. Oh, let's go out and get scared.
Both: Whoo!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking up to Sandy's treedome.]
Patrick: Sure you can handle this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'll be fine, Patrick. Really. But can we hold hands, just in case you get scared?
Patrick: Deal.
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter Sandy's treedome, which has been made into a science lab.]
Both: Whoa...
[Just then, a dark, shadowy figure creeps up behind SpongeBob and Patrick. The shadowy figure turned out to be Sandy in her mad scientist costume.]
Sandy: Welcome to my lab, SpongeBob and Patrick. I am the evil Dr. Franken-Cheeks.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Sandy. I didn't recognize you. [laughs]
Patrick: Uh, yeah, great costume.
Sandy: Oh, thanks, guys. Now, feast your fingers on my jars of horror!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa...
Sandy: Stick your hand in the jar and guess what's inside...If you dare!
SpongeBob: Oy. [sticks his hand in a jar and feels noodles] Ew. Oh. Ew, it feels like worm guts.
Sandy: Wrong! [removes napkin to reveal noodles] It's just noodles.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, I'm savvy to this game, Sandy. [sticks his hand in a second jar and feels a squishy brain] So these brains are probably a slimy head of lettuce, or maybe some boiled broccoli.
Sandy: Wrong! It's— [removes napkin but reveals that Patrick is in the jar] Patrick? Get out of there.
Patrick: Don't stop, SpongeBob. That's the spot. Ah...
SpongeBob: Patrick, you really got me. [laughs]
[SpongeBob continues poking Patrick's brain. Patrick makes some weird faces including the one where he sticks his eyeballs out with his tongue.]
Sandy: Ew! [cuts to Sandy showing SpongeBob and Patrick her creation] How impolite of me! I forgot to introduce you to my little friend. [reveals an acorn monster puppet underneath the tarp]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [timidly] Oh...
SpongeBob: That's the most realistic fake monster I ever saw.
[The puppet comes to life and looks at SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sandy: [as the acorn monster] Who are you calling fake?! [roars; SpongeBob and Patrick scream; Sandy laughs and activates the puppet; the puppet chases SpongeBob and Patrick] Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell the fear of a scared SpongeBob! [laughs manically]
[SpongeBob and Patrick gibber in panic. The puppet grabs SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa!
[The puppet eats them. Then it opens up its stomach to reveal that SpongeBob and Patrick are terrified on the spooky gadget inside. Then they pop out.]
SpongeBob: I love it! Oh, thank you, Sandy. That was so much fun. Patrick, you were right. Scary equals funny.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy: Hooray!
[The scene changes to Squidward and Mr. Krabs setting up a haunted tourist attraction, as well as the Halloween party, for the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is dressed as a dollar bill while Squidward appears to not be wearing a costume. SpongeBob and Patrick walk by.]
Mr. Krabs: Come in and see the horrors of the Chum Bucket.
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter inside. Patrick moans in fear. Inside, they see displays of Plankton doing scary things at the Chum Bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: [voiceover] Ha, ha, ha, ha! I'm Plankton! Ha, ha, ha, I'm evil! [laughs manically, but coughs]
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the place, laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Scary.
Mr. Krabs: What are you two laughing about? There's nothing funny about the food abuse that goes on at the Chum Bucket! You should be terrified!
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Mr. Krabs, but our new philosophy is "scary equals funny."
Squidward: Yeah, and funny divided by two idiots equals stupid.
Mr. Krabs: I don't get it. When I was a kid, Halloween meant 24 continuous hours of screaming your head off! These kids today...
[Patrick laughs as Mr. Krabs and Squidward turn and leave in disbelief.]
Plankton: [voiceover and wails] Come to the Chum Bucket, and witness the horrors of the Krusty Krab! You may never eat a Krabby Patty again! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Ready for more funny, Sir Clanks-a-lot?
Patrick: I'm driving! [picks up SpongeBob and uses him as a jousting lance; he charges towards the Chum Bucket] Charge! [laughs as he crashes into several trick-or-treaters who are dressed as bowling pins]
Trick-Or-Treaters: Whoa!
[Patrick runs towards the Chum Bucket and crashes into a wall. SpongeBob and Patrick enter inside and Patrick sets SpongeBob down. Karen comes out, dressed as a cat.]
Karen: Welcome to the Chum Bucket. I'm Karen the cat. [meows]
Plankton: Do the scary part.
[Karen turns on her screen and reveals a scary cat on it. Patrick moans in fear, but SpongeBob thinks it's funny and laughs.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, scary! [laughs]
Plankton: Scary? That's nothing. [pushes the button and switches into his devil costume] Behold! [reveals scary displays of the Krusty Krab] The horrors of the Krusty Krab. [laughs] Look down.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hm?
SpongeBob: Oh.
Patrick: Ooh.
[SpongeBob and Patrick follow the arrows on the floor and enter Plankton's scary tourist attraction.]
Plankton: [over loudspeaker] No dawdling! Step right up! [shows a scary display of Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and Squidward] The evil Mr. Krabs and his band of jolly, mindless fools stalk Bikini Bottom by night for delicious victims then drag their lifeless bodies back to the kitchen, and grind them into grinders!
[Karen pops up with a woman screaming on her screen. Patrick is terrified, but SpongeBob still finds it funny as he laughs.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Plankton, you are a panic.
Plankton: And guess what? You're eating it! Krabby Patties are people! They're people patties! You're eating people patties! [laughs and throws a Krabby Patty in Patrick's face]
[SpongeBob laughs. Karen pops up and hisses like a cat. Patrick screams and hides in his costume. SpongeBob, still thinking it's funny, continues to laugh. Karen and Plankton are not impressed with SpongeBob's laughter.]
Trick-Or-Treater 4: Yeah! [giggles] Come on!
[Trick-or-treaters in Bikini Bottom continue to have fun on Halloween. Everyone is laughing and chattering while others are ringing doorbells, asking for candy.]
Trick-Or-Treater 5: [pops out of a trashcan] Boo!
Trick-Or-Treaters: [screams]
[One citizen laughs but gets scared by someone holding a toy spider. Meanwhile, in the skies above Bikini Bottom, a familiar green ghost ship sails in the clouds. The owner of the ship appears to be none other than the Flying Dutchman himself.]
Flying Dutchman: Ah! Music to me ears. Halloween night, and everyone is getting their bloomers scared off! This holiday is the worst! [soberly] Wait a millennium. [takes out a telescope and sees a trick-or-treater not being scared] That kid isn't screaming with fear.
[The Flying Dutchman takes out a fishing rod and fishes the trick-or-treater up.]
Trick-Or-Treater 6: Huh. What do you want?
[The Flying Dutchman roars and makes a scary face. The trick-or-treater is now completely scared. He freaks out and falls down.]
Flying Dutchman: Scare and release! [laughs] I love this job.
[Suddenly, he hears rattling on the side on his ship. It turns out to be SpongeBob's laughter. The Flying Dutchman looks down and one of SpongeBob's "laughs" hits him really hard.]
Flying Dutchman: Ugh. [gets up and his eyes are red] Who dares to laugh at All Hallows' Eve?! [calmly] I'm going to find out.
[The Flying Dutchman steers his ship downwards and stops right in between the Chum Bucket and the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob comes out of the Chum Bucket laughing while pulling a fainted Patrick out in a wagon.]
SpongeBob: Gee, who would've thought I'd be laughing myself silly tonight? [laughs]
Flying Dutchman: You! [people run away, screaming] You dare to laugh on Halloween?!
SpongeBob: Um...I guess so? [laughs]
Flying Dutchman: What's the matter with you? Aren't you afraid of scary things?
SpongeBob: Well, I was, until I found out that scary equals funny.
Flying Dutchman: "Scary equals funny?" [growls and roars while making a scary face]
SpongeBob: [laughs as he uses the Flying Dutchman's fire to roast marshmallows] I love this guy! [sighs and eats the toasted marshmallows]
Flying Dutchman: I don't get it. How could anyone confuse scary with funny? [turns around and looks at the Halloween decorations at the Krusty Krab] Hm. No wonder you're not scared. These decorations are laughable! [breaks a decoration in half] I'm sorry, kid. I had no idea how fright-deprived you were. Not to worry. You're in bad hands! [he uses his powers to turn the wagon into a little amusement park cart; SpongeBob climbs into it while Patrick regains consciousness] I'll show you something to scream about aboard me ship! [thunder claps as he points to his ghostly ship] You interested?
SpongeBob: Sure. Can I bring a guest?
Flying Dutchman: Does a bear fish sleep in the kelp forest? [he and SpongeBob laugh; then he snaps his fingers]
[The Flying Dutchman's ship lowers a plank with rail tracks on it. The cart drives up the plank. SpongeBob is really excited about the ride while Patrick is really scared. The Flying Dutchman laughs sinisterly.]
Patrick: Where are we going, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: We are going to comedy heaven, Patrick. This is going to be so funny! [laughs]
[Patrick whimpers as he holds SpongeBob. The cart stops in midair. The ship forms two doors and opens with a green mist seeping out.]
Patrick: This music doesn't sound funny, SpongeBob.
[The doors close and Patrick continues to quiver with fear, clanking his costume in the process.]
Flying Dutchman: Stop that clanking!
Patrick: Sorry.
[The cart drives into the darkness and the episode fades to black. The screen goes back on with the Flying Dutchman flying around SpongeBob and Patrick, laugh manically at them.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Hey!
Flying Dutchman: All bilge rats on deck! We have company, and we want to show them a good time! [laughs as he flies through SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: [laughs] That tickled!
[Just then, several ghostly pirates appeared, laughing manically at SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick is completely horrified while SpongeBob remains smiling, still thinking it's funny.]
Flying Dutchman's Ghost Pirate: Hang on to your bloomers, SpongeBob! It's going to be a bumpy fright! [laughs]
[The ghosts continue to laugh. Patrick is clinging onto SpongeBob as the cart takes them to a skull-shaped door. SpongeBob yells excitedly while Patrick closes his helmet. The cart plows through the doors and drives across the tracks. The Flying Dutchman is playing the organ and his pirate ghost sing a little ghostly tune.]
Flying Dutchman's Ghost Pirates: ♪When you hear the lonesome ring of chimes that bring the spirits singing, soon your spine is tingling and there's just one thing to say, ahh! [eyeballs open up in the darkness] Eyeballs in the dark dilating, now your heart is palpitating, and there's only just one thought that you can convey. [all scream] Terror all around you! You can't get away! We take pride in making sure you have a frightful stay. [the cart drives on a haunted table] Join the wretched chorus in the nightmare play, and remember it's all you can scream at the ghost café.♪
[Ghosts monsters wail and moan in a scary fashion. Patrick is really scared, but SpongeBob laughs, still thinking it's funny. The cart drives around a few loops as a three-headed horse skeleton pops out and neighs. The dragon skeleton pops out and shrieks. Another skull-shaped door opens and lets the cart drive through.]
SpongeBob: Oh...
[The cart stops in the middle of what appears to be a pin the ball game machine.]
Flying Dutchman's Ghost Pirates: ♪Terror all around you and we've just begun. [a monster hand pulls the lever and activates the machine] You'll be trembling helpless lump of fear when we are done. Grim unearthly creatures flaunting nauseating features make for ghastly midnight screechers, you'll be speechless but for Ahh! [the machine flings SpongeBob and Patrick into a cannon and is shot in midair filled with ghosts] Surrender to the horrifying phantom freaks who death-defying stunts of fearful madness startle with a shocking interjection from which there is no protection! [all wail] Boo!♪
[SpongeBob laughs as the cart falls through the floor. The Flying Dutchman leans over to hear. SpongeBob's laughter hits him hard again.]
Flying Dutchman: Grr...How can he still be laughing? I've never been so humiliated. I got to do something here.
SpongeBob: Boy, Patrick, I wish all our friends could be here. They'd love this place! [laughs]
Flying Dutchman: Friends! He's got friends. That's it! I know how to scare this guy. [laughs manically as he unleashes his ghostly mist down from his ship into Bikini Bottom]
Sandy: [gives candy to several trick-or-treaters] Happy Halloween! [the ghostly mist surrounds her and takes her soul from her body] W—what? Where?
[Several trick-or-treaters run up to Mr. Krabs and Squidward, who are handing out candy.]
Trick-Or-Treaters: Trick or treat!
[Suddenly, the Flying Dutchman's ghostly mist surrounds them and takes their souls from their bodies.]
Squidward: Huh? Oh! [screams]
[The souls of Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are being lifted in the air by the ghostly mist.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey!
[The trick-or-treaters laugh and throw eggs and toilet paper at Squidward and Mr. Krabs' motionless bodies. Mr. Krabs growls in anger. Back inside the Flying Dutchman's ship, SpongeBob and Patrick are still riding the cart. Patrick is still afraid while SpongeBob continues to laugh, still thinking it's funny. SpongeBob stops laughing and sighs. They turn to see Sandy's soul locked up in a cage.]
Sandy: SpongeBob! Patrick! Help me!
SpongeBob: [laughs] That almost looks like Sandy.
[They see the souls of Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Squidward, and Gary locked up in cages as well.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
Plankton: Patrick!
Squidward: Help us!
Gary: [meows forlornly]
SpongeBob: [sighs] That almost looked like Mr. Krabs and Squidward and Gary and Plankton. [laughs] Funny. Oh, Patrick, this is hysterical. [laughs] Why aren't you laughing? [laughs until he sees Patrick's body motionless] Patrick? What's wrong with you?
Patrick: [his soul is locked in a cage as well] Help me, SpongeBob! My body's butt itches!
SpongeBob: Patrick? Is this really happening? Hey, this isn't funny.
Patrick: I was wrong, SpongeBob. Sometimes, scary equals scary!
[Patrick's motionless body falls on SpongeBob and he screams.]
SpongeBob: Hm? [pulls out his chalkboard, erases the word "funny", and replaces it with "AHHH!"] Yup. I got the same answer. Scary equals "Ahh!"
Flying Dutchman: Success! I knew that would get him!
[SpongeBob is finally convinced that scary doesn't equal funny at all and screams in fear. His skeleton runs out of his body. SpongeBob's skin and skeleton run out of the ship.]
SpongeBob: Ahh!
[SpongeBob's skeleton and skin fall to the ground and attempt to run.]
SpongeBob's Skeleton: That's the scariest thing I ever saw in my life!
SpongeBob's Skin: Me too. But we gotta go back.
SpongeBob's Skeleton: Go back? Are you nuts?
SpongeBob's Skin: Show a little backbone! We gotta save our friends!
SpongeBob's Skeleton: Oh, you're right. But I'm still scared. Will you hold my hand?
SpongeBob's Skin: Deal.
[SpongeBob's skeleton and skin shake hands and they both go back together. SpongeBob runs back to the Flying Dutchman's ship to rescue his friends. Meanwhile, back in the ship, the Flying Dutchman flings Plankton's cage and laughs manically at the rest of SpongeBob's friends. Then he spins the cage around, frightening with various monsters.]
Flying Dutchman: Ooh. [laughs]
[Plankton comes up with an idea. He rips himself in half and floats out between the cage's bars. He puts himself together and floats up to the Flying Dutchman.]
Plankton: You know, I gotta say, pretty impressed with your whole evil presentation here. Nice work. I could use a guy like you to walk through walls. I take over the world, and we split it, 70-30. How's that grabbin' you? [the Flying Dutchman zaps Plankton and turns him into a ghoul] Yes, master... [kisses the Flying Dutchman's ring and flies onto his shoulder]
Flying Dutchman: I guess with friends like SpongeBob, you don't need anemones, huh, gang? [laughs]
Patrick: You can't talk about SpongeBob like that!
Squidward: Oh, yeah? If SpongeBob's so great, where is he? Huh?
Flying Dutchman: And, now, I'm going to roast your souls over a devil pit! [snaps his fingers and transports them over a devil pit] Just like Grandma used to!
[They all scream.]
Patrick: The blue fire is so hot!
[The Flying Dutchman laughs as he is about to roast everyone. Suddenly, Sandy's acorn puppet plows through the ceiling and roars, frightening the Flying Dutchman.]
Sandy: My puppet?
[The acorn puppet growls and charges at the Flying Dutchman. However, because the Flying Dutchman is a ghost, the puppet was unable to touch him and is sent flying to a wall. The puppet breaks into pieces and tiny acorns, revealing SpongeBob inside.]
SpongeBob: You let my friends go, buddy boy! [slides down]
Flying Dutchman: You were trying to scare me? Now that is funny. [laughs] You couldn't frighten me in a million eternities, kid.
Plankton: I think he could, master. You've never seen what's inside his brain!
Flying Dutchman: His brain? Ha! What's scary about that?
Plankton: I was in there once. It's too terrifying, even for ghosts!
[The Flying Dutchman grabs Plankton, throws him to the ground and stomps on him with his ghostly boot. He raises his foot, revealing a completely smushed Plankton.]
Flying Dutchman: I'll decide if it's scary or not!
[The Flying Dutchman shrinks himself into a smaller size, flies into SpongeBob's head and goes directly into his brain. He appears in the animation style and drives in a car with crab claws on them. He hears jolly music and the claws grab the little floating hearts. A unicorn-shaped cloud pushes him off the cliff and sends him crashing into a rainbow from a frog whose using it as a jump rope. He emerges out from the rainbow.]
Flying Dutchman: Wa...Whoa!
[One claw grabs a talking stripe tree, swings around and around, and lets go, making a little character fall out of the car. An eel flies out of the car and flies in the air. Three penguins hitch a ride on the eel and fly into an igloo. The igloo turns into a baby stroller and kittens appear riding in it. SpongeBob appears in the Flying Dutchman's hat, laughing. A jellyfish stretches itself over the Flying Dutchman and jellybeans fall out from underneath. The Flying Dutchman is carried off by a seahorse who is smack its lips. They pass by a clam with a mermaid in it. Then they stop to a colorful door, which opens and reveals bouncing smiley balls.]
Flying Dutchman: Ah! Ah! Ah! Don't—don't! [turns into a blob and a crab claw pinches him in half; he screams]
[SpongeBob regains consciousness, rolls his eyes to the back of his head, and sees the Flying Dutchman crying.]
Flying Dutchman: [cries] That didn't scare me one bit. [turns black and reveals eyeballs and a ghost; then he turns back to normal] I—I bet you don't have a scary thought in your entire brain!
SpongeBob: Oh, scary...Hm...You know, what always scares me out of the room is when my mom takes out naked baby pictures. [laughs]
[Suddenly, a giant baby version of SpongeBob appears before the Flying Dutchman.]
Baby SpongeBob: [coos] I wuv you this much!
[The Flying Dutchman screams and hyperventilates as the giant baby SpongeBob grabs and hugs him. Soon, all of the dream characters join in as the unicorn-shaped cloud makes a rainbow above them.]
Flying Dutchman: [gets kissed by the eels] I'm actually scared! [screams as tombstones appear in his eyes; he flies out of SpongeBob's head and growls after having enough] So much horror! [screams as he flies out and leaves his ship]
[The Flying Dutchman's ship disappears. SpongeBob and his friends' souls are now floating in midair. They look down, scream and fall to the ground.]
Everyone: Ahh!
Sandy: [her soul returns to her body] Ooh.
Mr. Krabs and Squidward: [scream and their souls return to their respective bodies, which pleases them] Oh.
Patrick: [his soul returns to his body] Oh! I got my butt back! [slaps his buttocks]
Sandy: I don't know what's inside that brain of yours, but I sure hope I never see it. Thanks, SpongeBob.
Patrick: [shows a chalkboard with the words "Scary equals Scary" with the word funny crossed out] But did we learn anything?
SpongeBob: Sure. We learned not to be afraid to never be scared of being afraid again. [laughs as he erases the chalkboard]
[SpongeBob's friends carry SpongeBob and praise him for his heroic efforts of stopping the Flying Dutchman and saving the day.]
Mr. Krabs: My employee saved us! Party at the Krusty Krab! For a reasonable fee.
[They carry SpongeBob inside the Krusty Krab as the ghost balloon flies over. Plankton, whose soul returned to his body, wakes up.]
Plankton: Ugh. What happened? Whew. Must have been a nightmare.
Trick-Or-Treater 1: [picks up Plankton] Hey, guys! Free candy!
[The trick-or-treater throws Plankton in his mouth and starts chewing on him. The screen then says "Happy Halloween" to the viewers and ends the episode.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is flipping Krabby Patties as he dances to the music on the radio.]
SpongeBob: Whoo! Yeah! [shakes his butt to the music] Oh, oh! [blows a raspberry, takes off his hat and rolls a stack of patties on the grill] Oh! [shakes his butt again, dances for a bit and grills the patty with his nose] Ooh! [smoke goes up the chimney and SpongeBob makes a perfect patty] Oh! [the patty bounces on his butt while dancing to the music]
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need— [sees SpongeBob dancing] Whoa. Sponge—
[SpongeBob screams as Squidward's holler startled him. The patty flies into Squidward's face and gets sucked into the chimney.]
SpongeBob: Patty, no! [climbs on Squidward and goes to reach the patty] Oh, I can't quite reach it.
[Squidward is wailing in agonizing pain as his face gets burnt on the grill. He pushes SpongeBob and pulls himself of the grill's surface. What remains of his face are bare muscles and a large nose bone. He grumbles as he grabs his original face. Suddenly, smoke fills up the entire restaurant. The customers run outside flopping around and gasping for air.]
Mr. Krabs: [coughs] Listen here, boy-o! As long as that patty's stuck in the chimney, it's money outta me pocket! You're gonna have to go up there and fish it out.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Looks like I'm taking my career to new heights. [giggles as Mr. Krabs pushes him to the ladder. He climbs up the ladder and reaches the rooftop] Meep! All right, chimney, prepare to be swept. [giggles and extends his arm to make it long enough for him to reach. He reaches his arm down the chimney and grabs the patty] There you are! [reels his arm back up and the patty is dirty from the smoke. He blows on it and rubs the smoke off] Good as new! [turns to climb back down, but a drop of ketchup splatters and he slips on it. He sees the patty fall and grabs it before it falls. The crowd below gasps and the patty begins to slip; gasps] Hold on, patty! I've got you! [struggles to hold onto the patty, but it slips off his hand] No!
[The patty falls to the ground, splattering ketchup all over the everyone's faces. The patty is ruined and the customers cry.]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, SpongeBob. Time to come back down and get to work so I can garnish your wages for wasting that patty!
[SpongeBob looks down at the ground and imagines that the height of the Krusty Krab is much higher than it really is. He hallucinates and then falls back down to the actual Krusty Krab roof. He then grips the roof in further fear.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, you know, I think I'll just stay up here for a while. It's such a nice day, and all.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, boy-o. Just climb on down!
SpongeBob: [yelping dizzily as he clings on the chimney] No, I'm good! [groans loudly]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I order you to come down here immediately!
Sandy: Don't worry, I'll get him down with my newest invention: Extend-O-Boots. I just press this button, and... [pushes the button on her suit and her boots extend her very high] Whoa! [she reaches the surface] Sorry, I haven't worked out all the kinks yet! [she clumsily tries to walk with her extended legs] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa-oh-oh! [the customers fled as Squidward sleepily walks out the doors] Whoa!
Squidward: What the—[gets kicked by Sandy's Extend-O-Boots and is sent flying out in the distance before exploding on impact]
Mr. Krabs: So, uh... anybody else got an idea?
Patrick: It's okay, I got him! [Throws in a duck-float, then bounces on it. He falls onto a plank of the roof that tosses SpongeBob upwards, but SpongeBob fell right down back to where he was. SpongeBob wraps his arms around the chimney] Hey, SpongeBob. Whatcha doing wa-a-ay up here? [shows the Krusty Krab exaggeratedly taller than it really is] Let's climb down now. [pulls SpongeBob, but SpongeBob but struggles to hold onto the chimney]
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, Patrick, but you go on ahead. [springs back to the chimney] I just can't do it. It's too far down! [sobbing]
Patrick: Aw, don't worry, SpongeBob. Your old pal Patrick has another plan to get you off this roof.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Sure. Just do what I do. [winks] Hm... [walks off the roof but falls down to the ground, smashing a hole in the ground] Ow!
SpongeBob: Uh, never mind, Patrick. I think I'll stay where I am. [comes back to the roof and hyperventilates]
[The customers become annoyed and frustrated at SpongeBob's dilemma and walk off. The scene changes to nighttime.]
SpongeBob: Hey, it's not so bad up here. Pretty great, really. I sure do miss my friends, though. Hey, maybe I can see them from up here.
[SpongeBob looks out from the roof and sees his house, Squidward's house, and Patrick's house. Inside Squidward's house, Squidward is preparing himself dinner.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, looks like Squidward has a date. Good for him. It can be so tough to put yourself out there. [sees Squidward clink both glasses of wine and drinks them both] Oh, no. Poor Squidward. He's all alone! [gets an idea] Ah! [pulls out a flashlight] Don't worry, friend. I'm here for you. [shines a light down at Squidward's house and makes a shadow puppet]
[SpongeBob's shadow puppet gives Squidward a relaxing massage.]
Squidward: Hm? Oh! Oh, that feels good. [sees SpongeBob's shadow puppet] Huh?! [clings to the wall and screams as if he's seeing a ghost]
SpongeBob: Hmm, maybe he's hungry. [his shadow puppet tries to feed Squidward his dinner, but he runs over to the door] Come on, Squidward! Eat your... [his hand cramps up] Ow, hand cramp! Hand cramp! Hand cramp! [his shadow puppet cramps up and throws everything around. Squidward's dinner falls on Squidward] Ow-ow-ow-ow! [his shadow puppet knocks over the table; Squidward tries to open the window, but gets hit by the shadow puppet. He escapes through the front door and runs away] Guess he wasn't hungry after all. I guess there's nothing left to do but go to sleep. [shivers as he sleeps] Oh, I wish I had my bed... [almost slips, but suddenly notices a bunch of scrap pieces of wood and metal in the dumpster; he chuckles] Hey, that gives me an idea.
[SpongeBob grabs several wood from below and begins building himself a bed. He sharpens a pencil with his head, draws a line on a board and saws it in half. He hammers a board with a nail.]
SpongeBob: [picks up a board] Uh-huh. [rubs sandpaper on the piece of wood with his butt] Oh, yeah. [hugs the piece of wood]
[SpongeBob shoots glue on a piece of wood and glues three stumps on it for support. He hammers the last nail and his bed is completed.]
SpongeBob: Perfect. Good night... [wind blows] nobody.
[SpongeBob shivers in bed. His wooden blanket flew off by the wind. The sun now rises. Mr. Krabs is now seen with a mug of coffee.]
Mr. Krabs: Yoo-hoo, SpongeBob! Time to wake up!
SpongeBob: [extremely tired] Oh, morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [drinks some coffee] I've come up with a solution for your little roof problem, boy-o! [gently yanks the rope that holds the grill]
[Squidward hoists the grill up to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: Now you can cook even if you can't get back down.
[The grill sets itself in front of SpongeBob. He happily wakes up from his tiredness and hugs the grill.]
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now start making me money!
SpongeBob: Oh, Grilly, I thought I'd never see you again! [kisses the grill] Something still doesn't feel right, though.
[SpongeBob grabs some nails, sticks them on a board and nails it down on some wood. He uses his tongue as a measuring stick to measure another board. Then he saws, drills and hammers three boards at the same time. He holds two boards in his mouth to drill holes in each board. He hammers the last nail and his replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen on the roof is completed.]
SpongeBob: Perfect! Just like my old kitchen. [pushes his nose which opens his pants; he takes out his spatula and throws several patties on the grill] I'm ready! [dings a wooden ring-bell and brings in a plate of Krabby Patties with three napkins beside] Squidward, order's up! Oh, yeah. I'm stuck up on this roof. Hmm...how do I get these patties down to the customers? [gasps and gets an idea when he sees napkins being blown by the wind] Eureka!
[Meanwhile, inside the restaurant downstairs, the customers are starting a riot on Squidward and Mr. Krabs.]
Customers: We paid for patties, Krabs! Where's our food?
Mr. Krabs: Hey, calm down, everyone. I'm sure we can figure something out that doesn't involve violence or...refunds.
Gus: [sees patties parachuting down from the roof on napkins] Hey, outside! It's raining Krabby Patties!
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Huh?
[The customers run out of the restaurant and get their patties. Frankie Billy slides on the ground and catches the patty with his mouth.]
Umpire: Safe!
Jennifer Millie: I'll take one Krabby Patty and a drink, please. [sticks out her tongue and a patty lands on it] I said, "And a drink!" [a cup of soda falls on her face]
[Harold lays out a table and prepares to eat his patty. But Buddy climbs up and eats it before him.]
Frankie Billy: [chews on his patty] Huh? [spits it out] These are cold! I paid for a hot meal.
Customers: Yeah! [shouts]
Frankie Billy: Maybe if we go up there, we can get 'em fresh!
Norma Rechid: To the roof!
Customers: Yeah! [climb up the ladder and reach the rooftop]
SpongeBob: Whoa! I better make more room up here.
[The scene changes to the rooftop made into the replica of the main Krusty Krab dining room.]
Mr. Krabs: You know, boy-o, at first I just thought you were being a lily-livered, spineless, crybaby, scardey-pants, invertebrate loser. [SpongeBob groans dejectedly as he felt offended by Mr. Krabs' words] But this rooftop restaurant of yours really has me business booming! [kisses the money]
SpongeBob: Wish you could've talked Squidward into joining us up here.
[Meanwhile, at the ground floor of the Krusty Krab, Squidward decorated the entire dining room with his art. He even renovated his counter into a bed.]
Squidward: Finally, this place has some class. I might actually enjoy working here now. [jumps on his bed and goes to sleep]
[Meanwhile, on the roof of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are continuing filling out orders for the customers.]
Mr. Krabs: Ten more patties, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. K.
[Suddenly, the sky turns dark as rainclouds block out the sun. SpongeBob flips the patties and wind starts blowing.]
SpongeBob: Aw... [screams as the patties are getting blown away]
Mr. Krabs: [gets hit by the incoming patties] No, no—me money! [chases his money, but crashes into the customers and gets blown away by the wind]
Customer: [gets blown by the wind] Hey, I just realized being outside is awful!
[Patrick still remains on his chair, and eats all of the flying Krabby Patties. Soon, the weather starts to rain and thunder.]
Fred: Rain? But we're under—[gets blown away by the wind]
[The customers prepare to climb back down and take shelter from the storm.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait, wait, don't go! [chuckles nervously] A little wind never hurt anyone!
Patrick: Whoa, whoa! [gets hit in the face with an incoming patty, falls off the roof and crashes to the ground] Ow!
Mr. Krabs: [clings onto the roof] SpongeBob, we're losing 'em. Do something!
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir!
[As quick as a flash, SpongeBob builds the entire Krusty Krab on top of the original Krusty Krab roof. Everyone inside, including Mr. Krabs, is amazed now that they are safe from the storm.]
Mr. Krabs: It's beautiful, boy-o!
Henry-Bart: Yeah, it's pretty nice, but now that we're not outside, I'm starting to get bored.
Customers: Yeah, so... [chatter as they head out the door]
SpongeBob: [stops them] Wait! You can't be bored when there's dancing! [stuffs a radio inside his head, puts a tape cassette in his mouth and starts playing music; then he starts to dance] Whoo! [giggles as he shows off his dance moves]
[As SpongeBob shows off his dance moves, the customers and Mr. Krabs starts to feel the rhythm and joins in the dance.]
Customers: He's right!
[The customers stomp their feet to the music. Outside, the rain starts wearing out the mud, and so the Krusty Krab begins to sink in. Meanwhile, Squidward is still sleeping, oblivious to the fact that the Krusty Krab is sinking in. Everyone upstairs still continues to dance as the original Krusty Krab sinks into the mud. Suddenly, the rain stopped and out comes a rainbow. Everyone comes outside happy.]
SpongeBob: Hooray! We're not on the roof anymore!
Mr. Krabs: You know, after all that dancing and partying today, tomorrow's gonna feel like starting a new business!
SpongeBob: And I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor with you!
[Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and the customers laugh. Meanwhile, underground, Squidward wakes up from his nap and looks at his watch.]
Squidward: Time to go home already? [jumps off his bed and heads to the door, but bumps into dirt] Ow. [screams as dirt floods the entire bottom floor of the original Krusty Krab]


[The episode begins at Squidward's house where Squidward takes a really interesting meal he made out of the oven. He adds a bit of lemon juice on it and takes the meal to the table.]
Squidward: [French accent] I am a culinary genius, no? [sets his meal on the table where a wooden mannequin is sitting] Here you are, sir. Ze specialty of mah house. Roast salad à la Squidward. [gasps] Sacré bleu! I must apologize, monsieur! I have forgotten the parsley for the garnish. [takes his meal back into the oven] Stay warm, my little Squidy. [kisses it, but it burns his lips; he shrieks] Le oww! [closes the oven and goes outside to his garden] Typical, I always forget something.
[Squidward prepares to cut some of the parsley, but is pulled down by something.]
Squidward: Ugh!
[Squidward several attempts to pull the parsley out, but gets himself pulled into the ground. Underneath, he sees a sea bunny.]
Squidward: A sea bunny? [pulls parsley back]
[The sea bunny pulls Squidward's moustache off of his face.]
Squidward: [shrieks sharply] Ow!
[The sea bunny takes the moustache and ties it to his ukulele. He strums the ukulele and plays music while walking away in his tunnel.]
Squidward: [pulls himself out of the ground, retrieves his chef's hat, and puts it back on] That voracious vermin is ruining my French chef fantasy. [stomps on the ground and prepares to walk back in the house] Why—ah! [falls in the hole the sea bunny came out from]
[The sea bunny eats the parsley.]
Squidward: Grr! [tries to grab the sea bunny, but it pulls his hat down over his head; Squidward tries to take it off, but the sea bunny tickles him] Oh—oh, no, no, no, no! I have a ticklish core! [laughs]
[The sea bunny hops on top of Squidward and goes to ravage the garden. Suddenly, smoke comes out from the back door of his house.]
Squidward: Oh. [sniffs and opens his eyes]
[Squidward's house coughs up the smoke and fire breaks out. Squidward pulls himself out of the ground, grabs the hose, and rushes back in the house.]
Squidward: My roast à la Squidward!
[Squidward puts out the fire and carries his meal out. His roast à la Squidward is now burnt to a crisp and Squidward sighs. He sobs over his ruined creation. The sea bunny pops out of the hole and cries with Squidward.]
Squidward: What the—[growls as he goes to kill the sea bunny]
[The sea bunny grabs the burnt roast à la Squidward and shoves it in Squidward's mouth.]
Squidward: Oof! [gulps the burnt roast à la Squidward down and starts the feel sick]
[Squidward runs back in and the sea bunny hops back in his hole. The sea bunny continues to eat Squidward's vegetable garden as he dances to the music "The Blue Danube". He continues to enjoy himself until Squidward comes out, wearing a Viking outfit and holding a club.]
Squidward: I declare war on bunnies!
[Squidward runs to his garden and tries to strike the sea bunny with his club, but he ends up destroying his vegetables in the process. The sea bunny holds out a shield and protects himself from Squidward's club. The impact of the shield and the club causes it to get stuck on Squidward's face. Squidward pulls the club off his face and groans at his destroyed garden.]
Squidward: [growls and screams] I am going to bury that bunny! [falls in the hole again]
[The sea bunny giggles and belches. He buries Squidward in the soil and waters him with a watering can before walking away. Squidward then grows into a plant. Moments later, Patrick walks by and sees Squidward as a plant.]
Patrick: [gasps, climbs over the fence, and walks over towards Squidward] Wow. That's the ugliest eggplant I've ever seen! I don't think Squidward would mind if I took a little taste. Ooh, come here.
[Patrick grabs Squidward with his teeth and attempts to pull him off the stem. However, Squidward is completely stuck onto the stem, which causes Patrick to lose his grip and sends him falling into back under his rock. The scene changes to the sea bunny gathering more vegetables in Squidward's garden. He pulls out several vegetables and puts them in the basket. Suddenly, a really big carrot grows out of the ground. The sea bunny's buckteeth grow longer and sniffs it. The giant carrot, who is actually Squidward in disguise, pops out of the soil and runs away. The sea bunny begins to follow Squidward.]
Squidward: Ha, he's gonna fall right into my trap. [laughs]
[Squidward trips over a rock and gets caught in his own trap. The sea bunny begins knowing on Squidward's carrot costume.]
Squidward: [on the phone] Hello, Animal Control? I've got a sea bunny cornered in my garden and need assistance!
[The animal control officer pulls over with Patrick locked in the back. He exits the truck, grabs the sea bunny and puts him in a cage.]
Squidward: Did you have to catch him that easily?
SpongeBob: [handcuffs himself on the sea bunny's cage] I demand the release of this poor woodland creature. He's got rights too, you know.
Squidward: This is none of your business, SpongeBob, go away!
Animal Control Officer: You want him? You can keep him. [gives SpongeBob the cage] Save me a trip to the incinerator.
SpongeBob: Hooray! [giggles]
[SpongeBob pops out two rainbows and clouds from his head. The clouds fly under SpongeBob and form the word, "Happy!". SpongeBob floats away from Squidward's garden and flies into his house.]
Squidward: I'm warning you, SpongeBob. Keep that filthy animal away from my—[gets slammed in the face when SpongeBob kicks the front door closed]
SpongeBob: [opens the fridge and talks in sing-song] Vegetables! That's what you like, isn't it, bunny? We'll see what we got in the fridge.
[The sea bunny climbs out of the cage, sniff, and pants.]
SpongeBob: Whoops, I'm out of veggies. But I got something even better. [holds up Gary's food bowl] Gary's food! Yay! [the sea bunny sees how disgusting Gary's food is] Does bunny wunny like his dinny winny?
[The sea bunny throws the food bowl in SpongeBob's face. The bowl falls off and SpongeBob wipes the food off.]
SpongeBob: All right, Gary's food is out. Got it. I'll get you veggies. I'll be right back.
[SpongeBob forms himself into a egg-shaped rocket and blasts off out of his house. He flies over to the Barg'N-Mart to get vegetables. The sea bunny's stomach growls and begins looking around for food. He bites on the table and spits it out, breaking a flower pot in the process. He rips a hole on SpongeBob's chair and hops around, knocking over the shellphone. He opens the television screen, grabs some wires, and bites on them, electrocuting himself by accident. SpongeBob returns from the Barg'N-Mart with a bag of vegetables.]
SpongeBob: [sing-song] Bunny wunny! I've got a surprise for you—[screams when he sees the mess the sea bunny made]
[SpongeBob's teeth scream as well. The living room is a complete mess and the wires from the walls are sparking. The sea bunny goes into the bag and begins eating the vegetables.]
SpongeBob: I'm gonna have to chew-proof this whole house fast! [pulls out a bottle of hot sauce] Hot sauce ought to do the trick.
[SpongeBob squirts hot sauce on the couch and the shattered flower pot. The sea bunny sniffs the hot sauce and licks some. He belches out fire from his mouth and burns the flower pot. He giggles at this and hops for a bit. He goes to lick the hot sauce from the deflated chair. He belches fire at SpongeBob's  employee of the month photo and it burns. He goes to lick the hot sauce of SpongeBob's ribbons, trophy, books, and piggy bank as well as Gary's baby picture and toy ball. He belches fire on SpongeBob's stuff and burns everything. SpongeBob squirts hot sauce on Gary's shell and sees his living room on fire.]
SpongeBob: Huh? No, no, no, no!
[Thinking fast, SpongeBob takes a fire extinguisher and plugs it in his head. He absorbs the liquid from the extinguisher and spews it out all over the place to put out the fire. The sea bunny grabs the hot sauce bottle and drinks what's left of it. Suddenly, something bubbles in him and Gary backs away in panic. The sea bunny's face turns red and belches out a huge stream of fire.]
SpongeBob: My comic books!
[SpongeBob sprays water with the water gun to protect his Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book collection from the fire. The sea bunny's mouth gets filled with water and he is cooled down.]
SpongeBob: I gotta get rid of all that hot sauce.
[SpongeBob licks up all of the hot sauce until everything is clean.]
SpongeBob: [turns red hot and screams as his tongue erupts like a volcano] Oh, oh, oh, oh! [dunks in the toilet and cools himself off]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting up a cage for the sea bunny to live in.]
SpongeBob: Here we are! Water supply—check. Trampoline for hopping—check. Buckteeth sharpener—check. And an adding machine for multiplying. [giggles] Triple check-aroonie! Now the bunny will be more than happy to stay in his cage. Huh? [pushes the cage to the sea bunny]
[The sea bunny sniffs the cage. He is not happy at the cage and shrieks. He kicks the cage at SpongeBob and pants wildly.]
SpongeBob: Doesn't like cage... [falls into pieces] Check.
[The sea bunny pants and growls. He climbs on the wall, rips a hole and crawls underneath the wallpaper.]
SpongeBob: No, no, bunny, don't go in there! You'll get lost! I need my jellyfishing net. Where did I put that thing? [runs to the sofa and digs his hand in the cushion] Probably dropped it in here somewhere. Nyah, nyah—ah, got it! [pulls out Patrick with the jellyfishing net on his head]
Patrick: Hello!
SpongeBob: Patrick, did you fall between the cushions again?
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, I fell between the cushions. [takes of the net] But I have a solution to your bunny problem. I love the hunt!
[Patrick rips a hole on the wall and crawls underneath the wallpaper to go after the sea bunny. But no matter where he goes, he knocks down everything off the wall.]
SpongeBob: [screams in panic as things drop off the wall] No, no! No, don't! Please don't! That's my—[part of the ceiling as well as the ceiling fan falls down] All right, Patrick, that's enough hunting. You can come out now.
Patrick: I can't see where I'm going. How do I get out of here? [screams in panic as he crawls to another wall] SpongeBob, where are I? [gets absorbed by the wallpaper]
SpongeBob: Stay where you are, Patrick! I've got an idea. To the pet shop!
[The screen changes into a map where SpongeBob, in video game character form, goes to the pet store to buys something.]
SpongeBob: Thank you! [goes back to his house with another sea bunny in a cage] Patrick! I bought a second bunny to lure the first bunny out of hiding.
Patrick: Hooray!
[SpongeBob gets up, opens the cage, and lets out a female sea bunny with a pink bow on it. The sea bunny notices the female, crawls to the ground and pops out from the floor. He investigates her and see becomes heads over heels with him. They two sea bunnies dance to a tango and SpongeBob plays music with the accordion. Patrick reappears from the wall.]
SpongeBob: Hold still, Patrick, I see you. [rips a hole to free Patrick]
Patrick: [gasps for air and sighs] Thanks, buddy. [the two sea bunnies hop by] Aww, bunnies!
[SpongeBob laughs as he follows the sea bunnies. Patrick comes out from the wall and follows as well. The two sea bunnies go into the bathroom and hop into the laundry basket. When SpongeBob and Patrick enter the bathroom, the two sea bunnies hop out of the basket.]
SpongeBob: One, two...[another sea bunny comes out] Three?
[It turns out the two sea bunnies multiplied in the laundry basket and a whole bunch of sea bunnies hop out.]
Patrick: More bunnies!
SpongeBob: [nervous laugh] Yay!
[The sea bunnies climb into the hole on the wall and crawl under the wallpaper.]
SpongeBob: Uh-oh. [he and Patrick grab jellyfishing nets] Patrick, the hunt is on! [he and Patrick do their war cry]
[SpongeBob and Patrick climb into the hole on the wall and crawl under the wallpaper as well. They chase after the sea bunnies from the bathroom, to the living downstairs, and then out the front door.]
SpongeBob: Hey! Come back, bunny wunnies!
[SpongeBob and Patrick chase after the sea bunnies all the way to Squidward's house. Squidward appears in a funeral attire and pays his final respects to his vegetable garden.]
Squidward: [French accent] This is the last carrot. [places the carrot next to the gravestone] C'est la vie. [the sea bunny pops out from the ground] One more step, and I will spit you on a roast! I mean, roast you on a spit! [the ground underneath rumbles and more sea bunnies appear] Oh, oh, what's happening?
[SpongeBob and Patrick appear from the ground.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah. We're here to help!
Squidward: They're growing! [shrieks and runs into his house]
[the sea bunnies crawl into Squidward's house. Squidward zips the door shut as sea bunnies crawl under the wallpaper. Squidward hides under the table and dials the shellphone.]
Squidward: Hello, Animal Control? Save me!!
[The sea bunnies emerge from the wallpaper and from one of Squidward's paintings. More sea bunnies emerge from the cabinets while others emerge from the electric outlet. Squidward blubbers in panic as sea bunnies invade his house. One sea bunny emerges from his nose. His entire house is flooded with sea bunnies. Squidward escapes from the upper window of his house. He gets up and groans like an old man. He shakes the sea bunnies off him and growls in anger. He grabs a mallet from the shed and spits on his hand.]
Squidward: Get out of my house! Gah! [hits his house with the mallet] That'll get them out.
[Squidward's house cracks and breaks into two halves. The sea bunnies form into his own house from underneath the wallpaper, much to Squidward's horror.]
SpongeBob: Sorry about your house, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah. We just heard.
[Squidward is overwhelmed with what he did and whacked himself on the head with the mallet. His head opens and his brain flies out. Squidward goes mentally insane and grows bunny ears, whiskers, a pair of buckteeth, and a fluffy tail. He then begins to hop like a sea bunny.]
Squidward: [maniacal laugh] I'm a bunny now! [crazy laugh] I'm a bunny now! I'm a bunny now!
Animal Control Officer: Okay, Mr. Tentacles, easy does it. [puts a straitjacket on Squidward]
[Squidward kicks the animal control officer in the face and runs away. The animal control officer gets up and goes after the mentally-crazed Squidward with the net.]
Squidward: [maniacal laugh] I'm a bunny now! [crazy laugh] I'm a bunny now!
[As the animal control officer chase after the crazy squid into the sunset, one sea bunny makes a face to look like Squidward. He mumbles like Squidward and plays "Shave and a Haircut" on the clarinet before closing the sea bunny window, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Squidward is playing his clarinet very poorly and is driving the customers crazy.]
Harold: [pulls out his eyeballs and plugs his ears] Ah.
Nat Peterson: Make it stop! Ah! [crashes into a pole]
[Mr. Krabs exits his office and hears the horrible music Squidward's playing.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh. [sprays pest spray on the sour notes and groans] Mister Squidward! Quit that calamitous cacophony! You're driving me customers batty!
[Tom growls and crushes his drink in anger.]
Squidward: [pulls his clarinet out of his mouth] Well, I'm sorry you rubes can't enjoy jazz. I am practicing for a very important open mic night tonight.
Mr. Krabs: Well, practice somewhere else! This here's a jazz-free zone! [slaps Squidward hard, then holds his head to a "no jazz" sign]
[An eel customer sobs and walks out after being offended by the "no jazz" sign. Mr. Krabs lets go of Squidward and his head spins around.]
Squidward: [jibbers] Fine! I'll take my music to the other people then. [shoves his hat on Mr. Krabs' head]
Mr. Krabs: [pokes his eyes out through the hat] And if I see that clarinet again, it'll be going into the woodwind chipper! You hear me?
[Squidward grumbles as he leaves the Krusty Krab. Squidward walks up to the "Near Mint Comic Books" store where Bubble Bass is talking to his friends.]
Bubble Bass: As you can see, this is the first generation Talking Suburban Dad figurine, with realistic burger-flipping motion.
Suburban Dad Toy: Not right now, Billy. Daddy's had a long day.
Bubble Bass' friends: Ooh.
[Suddenly, their moment was interrupted when Squidward's sour music annoys them. It also makes Bubble Bass drop his action figure and it breaks its arm.]
Bubble Bass: Suburban Dad! No! [walks out and sees Squidward] You? [jumps up and slams on Squidward; Squidward crawls comes out injured] You—will remove that subpar woodwind from the premises, ere I smash its reed!
[Squidward pulls himself out of Bubble Bass and rolls back home. He crashes at his door, with his clarinet pierced through the door. Squidward falls down to the ground and pulls his clarinet from the door.]
Squidward: Can't practice anywhere in this town. [slams the door] Bunch of tasteless clowns! [grumbles and plays his clarinet outside his house's window]
Patrick: [playing with rocks] Smashy, smashy! Bang, bang! Sma–oh! [covers his ears] Ow! What is that noise? [looks up and sees Squidward playing his clarinet] Oh, no. Squidward's being attacked by that pointy screeching monster. Don't worry, Squidward! I'll save you! [throws a rock]
Squidward: [stops playing] What are you– [gets hit by the rock and crashes inside his house; appears without a head] Hm? Uh? Hm? [his head is pinned to the mantelpiece and his clarinet has a rock lodged in its mouth] Oh!
Patrick: You're welcome!
[The scene changes to Squidward about to put his clarinet on a pillow while he prepares to take a little nap.]
Squidward: [humming] It's time for our pre-performance nap. Tonight, we change lives with our music. [kisses his clarinet, puts it on a pillow and leaves to take a nap]
French Narrator: One nap later...
Squidward: [appears in a suit] Are you ready, my dear? We've got the– [gasps and screams]
[His entire living room has been damaged and his clarinet was stolen. The episode's  background color turns into black and white.]
Squidward: [narrating] And that's how it began. My life smashed to bits. My living room covered in broken dreams. Without my clarinet, the world was a drab and colorless place. [picks up the pillow and hears SpongeBob giggling outside] And that's when I saw him, my first suspect. [SpongeBob is playing in the puddles] When it comes to paying the stupid bill, SpongeBob always tipped 20%. [SpongeBob puts sand in his head and drains it out of his holes] He had to be involved. [walks over to SpongeBob] SpongeBob, what have you done with my clarinet?
SpongeBob: Ooh, Squidward, you're so hard-boiled. Are you playing a game? Oh, oh, can I play?
Squidward: I know you stole my clarinet! Tell me [slaps him] where! [slaps him again] It! [slaps him again] Is!
SpongeBob: [slaps himself] I [slaps himself again] Don't! [slaps himself again] Know! [giggles] It couldn't have been me, Squidward. I have an alibi. I was at Grandma's house all day and I have the kissy marks to prove it, [points to the kissy marks on his head] see? There's room for one more.
[Squidward is grossed out and he pushes SpongeBob away.]
Squidward: [narrating] His alibi was solid. Only a family member could stomach putting their lips on this fool.
SpongeBob: You know, we have lots of friends. Maybe they could help us find your clarinet.
Squidward: I don't have friends. I have suspects.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, don't you know a suspect is just a friend you haven't cleared of charges yet? [gets pushes down by Squidward] So... can I help you solve your case? Please, please, please?
Squidward: Try not to get in the way.
SpongeBob: Yeah! It's a play-date! I mean... [changes into his detective clothes] All right, I'll partner up with you this time. [flips a coin and it disappears] Huh?
[The scene changes to Squidward and SpongeBob driving in the streets as rain pours down.]
Squidward: [narrating] My... [clears throat] partner and I decided to check out my next suspect, the owner of a local greasy spoon. I figured a little "Good cop, bad cop" would get his jaw flapping so I–
SpongeBob: [narrating] Oh! Can I be the bad cop? Please, please, can I, please?
Squidward: [narrating] Yes, if you get out of my hard-boiled narration!
SpongeBob: [narrating] Sorry. [flips coin]
[They drive up to the Krusty Krab. They walk up to the front doors. SpongeBob flips a coin and the coin disappears.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gets pulled into the restaurant by Squidward]
[Mr. Krabs is in his office playing with his money.]
Mr. Krabs: What the–
[Squidward comes in and kicks away the desk.]
Squidward: Hey, Mister Krabs, how are you doing? Can I get you some tea? Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? [gives Mr. Krabs a cup of tea and he sips it] Now, where were you earlier–
SpongeBob: You seem hungry, dear. Home-cooked meal? [gives Mr. Krabs a microwavable meal]
Squidward: What are you doing, SpongeBob? [clears throat and pulls out a nail filer] Manicure?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [gets his claw filed by Squidward]
SpongeBob: [pulls in a makeover] Makeover? [puts Mr. Krabs in the makeover machine, and out comes Mr. Krabs with a long, blonde wig. SpongeBob sprays him with "Make Up in a Can" afterward]
Squidward: Warm blanket? [puts the blanket onto Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: New shoes? [pushes Squidward]
Squidward: Hey!
[SpongeBob puts shoes on Mr. Krabs' feet.]
Mr. Krabs: [rips the blanket] Enough!
SpongeBob: Hey, check out the dame.
[Mr. Krabs now appears as a woman. Squidward is grossed out at the appearance and nearly throws up.]
Mr. Krabs: What in the salty seven seas are you two doing?!
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, we're playing "Good cop, good cop." Sorry, Squidward, I don't know how to be the bad cop!
Squidward: [grabs and pulls down a hanging lamp over Mr. Krabs] We're looking for my clarinet, Eugene. I know you broke into my house this afternoon! I know you stole it! Now fess up!
Mr. Krabs: This afternoon? Well, I was–I've been here all day, counting me money! Just look at me butt groove! [points to his chair with butt grooves]
SpongeBob: [rubs his finger onto the butt groove] Good contours. [pushes on the seat] And still warm. Story checks out. [sniffs his finger, but notices it is extremely smelly]
Squidward: All right, Mr. Krabs, we'll mosey along this time. [leaves] Come on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Mm, hmm. [leaves as his eyes extend; he pulls them back]
Mr. Krabs: Boys, if you two do find that clarinet, could you bring it to me? So I can smash it to pieces!
[The scene changes Squidward and SpongeBob pulling up to the "Near Mint Comic Books" store to ask their next suspect.]
Squidward: [narrating] We pulled up to the local dweeb market, where I hoped to find my next suspect: maven of all things moronic, Bubble Bass. The sign said closed, but I could hear their nerdy murmuring inside.
[Bubble Bass is playing a board game with his friends inside the store.]
Bubble Bass: And then, from the depths of the barbeque, comes the ferocious, fire-breathing [pulls out his suburban dad action figure] Dad!
Squidward: [kicks the door] Bubble Bass! [his foot cramps up] Ow!
Bubble Bass: Huh? [runs away]
SpongeBob: [stops Squidward from chasing Bubble Bass] Squidward, wait! [pulls out his Mermaid Man action figure] Let him handle this.
[The scene becomes an imaginary action show where SpongeBob's Mermaid Man action figure chases Bubble Bass's Suburban Dad action figure. They climb up the book shelves, knocking over several comics.]
Suburban Dad: [throws actions figures] Take that! And that! [Mermaid Man punches them away] What? [he gets corned to the edge] All right. You've got me cornered. But I won't give up without a fight!
Mermaid Man: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Mermaid Man and Suburban Dad go head to head with one another.]
Squidward: [narrating] It was a real knockdown, drag-out fight. Or it would've been, if it hadn't been just two sad adults playing with toys.
Bubble Bass: Wait. Wait! Roll the dice. Did his punch land?
Bubble Bass' friend: [rolls the dice] It's a hit!
[Mermaid Man punches Suburban Dad. Suburban Dad falls but is grabbed by Mermaid Man.]
Suburban Dad: Huh? Oh. [exhales]
SpongeBob: Where were you this afternoon? Where's Squidward's clarinet?
Bubble Bass: I don't know what you're talking about. I was here all day. I swear it!
[Mermaid Man loses his grip and the Suburban Dad action figure falls and breaks into pieces.]
Suburban Dad: Billy, don't make me turn this boat around.
Bubble Bass: No! I still could have passed you off as near mint! [sobbing]
Bubble Bass' friends: [walk up to comfort Bubble Bass] Aww. So, sorry, man.
SpongeBob: I am so sorry for your loss.
Squidward: I'm not. Come on, SpongeBob, let's go. This is a dead end. [leaves with SpongeBob]
[The scene changes to Squidward's house.]
Squidward: [walk in and wrings out his hat] Well, there's only one more person on my list of suspects.
SpongeBob: [flips a coin] Patrick Star?
Squidward: Um, yeah, how'd you know?
[SpongeBob points to Patrick, who is eating some goo at the crime scene of where the Squidward's clarinet was taken.]
Patrick: Hey, guys!
Squidward: Well, the criminal returns to the scene of the crime. Spill the beans, Jack! Where's my clarinet?
Patrick: I don't know who Jack is! But I would like some beans!
Squidward: Let me lay it out for you, Chucko. When I took my nap today, you broke in through the window, smashed my living room, got that goo you're eating all over and stole my clarinet!
Patrick: Oh, this isn't goo. It's jelly! The good stuff too, from real jellyfish. [eats some jelly]
SpongeBob: [flips coin] Real jellyfish jelly? You can only find that in one place. That means our thief...
Squidward: Must have been at Jellyfish Fields! Let's go!
SpongeBob: Right behind you, pal. [flips coin and it disappears] Huh? [gets dragged away by Patrick] Whoa!
[The scene changes to Squidward, SpongeBob and Patrick driving to Jellyfish Fields.]
Squidward: [narrating] When we arrived at Jellyfish Fields, I could already hear my clarinet's dulcet tones.
[Squidward, SpongeBob and Patrick pull over, step out of the car and see a giant hive in the middle of the fields. It is revealed that the culprit who stole Squidward's clarinet is a group of jellyfish who are blowing through it to make music.]
Squidward: My baby! [grabs the clarinet from the jellyfish] Ha!
[The episode turns its color back on.]
SpongeBob: Oh! So it was the jellyfish that took your clarinet. But from the sound of it, I'd say they've learned that crime doesn't play! [giggles and Patrick slaps him]
[Squidward plays music with his clarinet.]
SpongeBob: Look, Squidward. The jellyfish are fans of your music.
Patrick: We should solve another mystery now.
SpongeBob: Yeah, uh, how about the mystery of where all my coins went? [flips a coin and it disappears] Huh? [coins fall on him]
Patrick: Solved!
[The scene changes to nighttime. The hive is now a nightclub where jellyfish can dine and watch the show.]
Jellyfish: [a jellyfish thug allows the jellyfish to enter] Thank you.
[The jellyfish sit back and watch Squidward play his clarinet on stage. SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick watch the show while wearing earplugs.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, yeah! Yeah, Squidward! [whistles]
[Mr. Krabs curls his hair and Patrick eats a bowl of jellyfish jelly.]
Squidward: [narrating] And that's how it ended. Clarinet returned. Case closed. Another mystery solved by: Squidward Tentacles, Jazz Detective.


[The episode begins at Squidward's house. Squidward is dancing along with the music from "The Nutcracker Suite." Squidward continues to dance and show off some of his moves. Just then, SpongeBob appears and joins in the dancing as well.]
SpongeBob: [whispering] You dance divinely.
[Squidward freaks out and clings himself to the ceiling with his suction cups. He loses his grip and falls to the floor. Patrick appears, removes the record from the phonograph, and places a different record on it. The record begins playing funky, rock music.]
Patrick: Shall we?
SpongeBob: Oh, I love this song!
[Patrick and SpongeBob dance to the rock music. Squidward gets really angry and removes the record from the phonograph.]
Squidward: Why are you nitwits in my house?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're bored!
Patrick: And we don't want to be bored!
SpongeBob: We wanna have fun.
[Patrick kicks the pillar holding Squidward's head sculpture. Squidward screams and catches the sculpture before it hits the floor. Squidward sighs in relief and his head shatters. SpongeBob is standing upside down and Patrick eats his pants.]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward. Give us something fun to do. Please?
[Squidward groans and Patrick's stomach grumbles.]
Patrick: Oh, let's play lunch!
SpongeBob: No problem. I'll whip up some grub.
[SpongeBob and Patrick run over to the kitchen and begin taking stuff out of Squidward's fridge and cabinets.]
Squidward: Leave my kitchen alone!
SpongeBob: Hm, there must be something I can scavenge up around here.
Squidward: [grins evilly and gets an idea] Oh! That's it. How would you two like to go on a... scavenger hunt?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Scavenger hunt?
Patrick: What's a scavenger hunt?
[SpongeBob takes out a dictionary from his head, turns the pages with his nose, and looks up the word, "Scavenger Hunt."]
SpongeBob: [reading] "A party game in which participants work in teams to collect a list of miscellaneous objects!" Scavenger hunt, yeah! What's first on the list, Squidward?
Squidward: Um, oh, uh, well, let's see. [takes out a roll of toilet paper and pretends to read something on it] Bring back the rare Desert Sandwich.
[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle and began searching all over the place to look for Squidward's "Desert Sandwich." SpongeBob looks for it in the phonograph.]
SpongeBob: Sandwich?
[Patrick looks for it under Squidward's picture.]
SpongeBob: [looks for it in Squidward's nose, which causes him to scream] Sandwich? Sandwich? [lets go of Squidward's nose]
Squidward: [straightens out his nose] Not in here! The sandwich is only found deep in the Bikini Badlands, out there!
Patrick: [he and SpongeBob stop looking] Oh.
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out and shuts the door] Phew. I am a genius.
[SpongeBob and Patrick stop at a sign pointing to the Goodlands and to the Badlands.]
SpongeBob: Goodlands, half a league.
[SpongeBob and Patrick observe the Goodlands. There, they see jellyfish swimming around, flowers and trees dancing, sun and rainbow shining down and a sea unicorn skipping along.]
SpongeBob: Badlands, 20,000 leagues?
[SpongeBob and Patrick observe the Badlands. There, they see a dried-up wasteland with a volcano, a cactus, and a skeleton with sea urchins crawling out. SpongeBob and Patrick are stunned, but they decide to go there anyway. The scene changes to them traveling the Badlands. They become exhausted from the high temperatures and are very thirsty since they had no drinking water with them. SpongeBob and Patrick collapsed from exhaustion.]
Patrick: So...thirsty. [rings SpongeBob's sweat and drinks it for water] Oh.
SpongeBob: [dried up and very weak] It's no use. We'll never find the rare Desert Sandwich.
[Suddenly, a sand tornado appears out of nowhere. SpongeBob and Patrick scream in terror and sand gets into their eyes. The sand tornado lifts them in the air and starts to carry them away. Meanwhile, back at Squidward's house, Squidward is in his bathrobe, dancing with "The Nutcracker Suite" again. The door opens and Squidward flies backward. SpongeBob and Patrick arrive.]
SpongeBob: Squidward! We did it! We brought back the first item!
[A sand tornado comes through the door and into the living room.]
Squidward: Sand? [sand is blown in Squidward's face]
[The sand tornado dies down, revealing a witch within it. The witch cackles.]
Squidward: [spits out the sand] Witch? [the witch cackles] Oh, good grief! Not that kind of sand witch! The Desert Sandwich has tomatoes and bread and—and—mayo.
Sand Witch: No worries, I used to work at an evil deli. [creates a sandwich with her magic] Ta-da!
Squidward: Oh, looks pretty good. [takes a bite and spikes poke out from his cheeks; he screams as the sandwich comes to life and bites his nose] Get it off! Get it off! [gets mauled by the sandwich monster]
[The sand witch cackles. The scene changes to the sandwich monster being locked in the refrigerator.]
SpongeBob: What's next on our scavenger hunt, Squidward?
Squidward: Hmm...oh. [sees a picture of a flower] Mm-hmm. Your next item is the Boxing Begonia! [spins the globes and points to the location] It only grows in the deepest canyon of the Mariana Trench.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh! [giggle as they run out the door]
Squidward: Ha. That'll keep them out of my hair. [rubs his head and it glimmers since he has no hair] Oh.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick looking down at the deepest canyon of the Mariana Trench.]
Patrick: It's so straight-downy.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. A scavenger is always prepared. [pulls out a rope, ties it to a nearby rock and goes to climb down, but the rope isn't long enough] The rope is too short! We need another one!
Patrick: [throws down a rope] Here!
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick! Where'd you get another rope?
Patrick: From that rock!
[Patrick slips off the edge and falls down into the canyon with SpongeBob, crashing into some stalagmites in the process. They both crash to the ground below the canyon.]
SpongeBob: Found it!
[The scene changes back to Squidward's house where Squidward resumes his dancing. SpongeBob and Patrick swing into his house through the window with the Boxing Begonia they found.]
SpongeBob: We're back!
Squidward: What? But—but it's not possible! [becomes amazed at the Boxing Begonia's beauty] Boxing Begonia? It's beautiful.
[The Boxing Begonia comes to life and starts beating up Squidward with boxing gloves.]
Patrick: The champ takes a swift uppercut to the jaw. [punches himself]
SpongeBob: Squidward is against the ropes. A left, a right.
Patrick: How can a man stand it?
[Squidward falls flat on the floor, knocking out his dentures.]
SpongeBob: Oh, and the champ is down!
Patrick: [holding up the Boxing Begonia] The winner!
[The scene changes to a beaten-up Squidward pacing back and forth.]
Squidward: How do you keep finding everything?
SpongeBob: [meditating] You have to keep your skull... numb.
Patrick: Yeah, we're numb skulls!
Squidward: [sighs and takes out a book] Your next mission is to find [points to the picture of the Loch Ness Monster] the Loch Ness Monster and bring him back...alive.
SpongeBob: Ooh, the Loch Ness Monster!
Patrick: Oh, so good! Oh, so good! [takes out a notebook and a pencil; he sharpens his pencil with his bellybutton] What color?
Squidward: [pushes the sofa] Doesn't matter! Good luck! [throws them out and grins evilly] They'll never find it. And if they do, it'll eat them. [laughs] It's a win-win. [yelps as the sofa falls on top of him]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick rowing their boat upside-down in the rivers of Scotland.]
SpongeBob: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
Patrick: How are we gonna find a monster in the dark? I can't see anything.
SpongeBob: We don't have to find it. It'll find us. [pulls out some bagpipes and plays music with it]
[As SpongeBob plays music with his bagpipes, a shadowy creature swims around and looms over them. SpongeBob and Patrick wail in fright. Meanwhile, back at Squidward's house, Squidward resumes his dancing and is playing with his clarinet while wearing a beautiful, purple hat and a scarf.]
Squidward: [sighs] I'm the greatest. [hears a knock at the door] And here comes the worst. [takes off his hat]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [enters] We're back!
[The Loch Ness Monster smashes through the wall above the front door with his head.]
Squidward: [shuddering] The lo—lo— The Loch Ness Monster! How did you find it?
SpongeBob: Oh, simple. [takes out his bagpipe] Bagpipes.
Squidward: [grabs the bagpipe] It likes bagpipe music? [the bagpipes blow air out]
Patrick: No, it hates it.
[The Loch Ness Monster roars, grabs Squidward with his mouth, and swallows him whole with the bagpipes.]
The Loch Ness Monster: Ahh...
SpongeBob: But it sure loves to eat 'em!
French Narrator: One very long digestive tract later...
[Squidward is completely worn out from nearly being digested from the Loch Ness Monster. SpongeBob and Patrick bounce on the sofa while Squidward sits in agony.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Give us another one! Give us another one! Give us another one!
Squidward: Oh, brother! [grins evilly and comes up with another idea] Brother...
SpongeBob: Come on, just one more.
Squidward: [pretends to act nervous] Well, all right, it's—it's impossible, but... [sniffles as he pretends to cry] if only you could find my long lost brother.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hold Squidward's hands] Brother?
Squidward: [chuckles wickedly as he grabs his picture and draws a mustache on it; he turns around and pretends to be heartbroken] I haven't seen him since he was a baby.
SpongeBob: Aww.
Patrick: Baby with a mustache.
Squidward: [rubs his head] He was an early bloomer.
SpongeBob: What was his name?
Squidward: Name, huh? Um...
SpongeBob: "Um?" Aw, what a pretty name.
Squidward: [pretends to be heartbroken] If I could just see him again... [pretends to cry] No.
[SpongeBob and Patrick fall for Squidward's cruel lies and they sob hysterically.]
SpongeBob: [hugs Patrick] That's so sad!
Patrick: Even my armpits are crying! [his armpits shed tears and he blows his nose]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, we've got some extreme scavenging to do!
Patrick: Yeah!
Squidward: [carries them out the door] Oh, thank you. [throws them down and slams the door] I'm free! [laughs]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick finding Squidward's "brother" in the streets of Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: Squidward's brother!
[SpongeBob looks for Squidward's "brother" in Jellyfish Fields.]
SpongeBob: [climbs up a tree with Patrick] Squidward's brother! [peeks into a jellyfish hive] Squidward's brother? [he and Patrick get stung by jellyfish]
[SpongeBob and Patrick pop out of an old lady's bathtub when an old lady was taking a bath.]
Patrick: Squidward's brother? [he and SpongeBob get whacked in the heads by the old lady]
[SpongeBob and Patrick go to look for Squidward's "brother" at Squidward's house. SpongeBob knocks on the door and Squidward answers it.]
SpongeBob: [gasps with Patrick] He's right here! Squidward's brother!
Patrick: The rascal shaved his mustache!
Squidward: [sighs] Good grief. [slams the door on SpongeBob and Patrick]
French Narrator: Six months later...
[SpongeBob and Patrick are completely tired and their voices have grown weak from looking for Squidward's "brother."]
SpongeBob: [weakly] Um! Squidward's brother!
Patrick: [weakly] Squidward's brother!
[SpongeBob and Patrick bump into a mailbox and it reads "Mrs. Tentacles" on it.]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Tentacles? [run up to Mrs. Tentacles' house and knocks on the door with his nose; Mrs. Tentacles answers] Mrs. Tentacles, you're Squidward's mother. You must know where Squidward's brother is.
Mrs. Tentacles: Brother? Squidward never had a brother. One of him was enough. [shuts the door]
SpongeBob: Aw, that's so sad. Squidward wanted a baby brother so badly he imagined one.
Patrick: Oh, man. Now it'll take even longer to find him.
SpongeBob: Hm? [a raincloud forms above his head] Oh, I'm getting a brainstorm!
Patrick: I've got you, buddy. [takes out an umbrella and puts it over SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, let it flow. [his body absorbs the raindrops from his raincloud] Ooh, I have a plan.
[The scene changes to Squidward playing his song "I Hate People" on his clarinet while dancing around and destroying everything inside SpongeBob's house. He enters SpongeBob's room and spins Gary around.]
Gary: [groans as he is annoyed with Squidward; he goes into his shell and puts earmuffs on] Meow!
[Squidward jumps outside and hops on top of Patrick's rock. It is revealed that while SpongeBob and Patrick had been gone for six months, he attached their houses onto his own house and made it into his own playground. He slides back into his house through the window and finishes his song.]
Squidward: Oh, I love my two new homes. And best of all, I haven't heard from those idiots in months! [laughs until SpongeBob and Patrick squish him with the front door as they enter]
SpongeBob: Squidward. We found your brother.
Squidward: [pulls himself off to the door and cruelly laughs at them] You urchin brains! I never had a brother!
SpongeBob: You do now!
Patrick: Two brothers! Us!
Squidward: What are you morons talking about?
SpongeBob: [takes Mrs. Tentacles by the hand and leads her in] Come on in, Mama.
Squidward: [stammering as he is shocked to see his mother] Ma—Ma—Mama?
Mrs. Tentacles: Isn't it lovely, dear? I've adopted your two little friends.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hold up their adoption papers] Brothers.
[Squidward begins to lose his sanity as he panics like crazy. He rubs his head until it explodes. The scene changes to a cameraman preparing to take a picture of Mrs. Tentacles, Squidward, SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Camera Man: Oh, what a beautiful family—yeee. Smile!
[Mrs. Tentacles, SpongeBob, and Patrick smile for the camera while Squidward groans in defeat. The camera snaps a picture of the "family", thus ending the episode.]


[The episode begins with a storybook entitled "Patnocchio." The book opens and the screens zooms into the picture of Karen in a beautiful fairy outfit holding her wand. She is seen standing outside of Bikini Bottom at night.]
Karen: Greetings, children of Bikini Bottom. I am Karen the Computer Fairy. [waves her wand and a scallop flies on her hand; she sings real loud, which causes the scallop to shatter into bits] And I have a magic tale to tell. [waves her wand and a picture of Patrick appears on her screen] Once upon a time, there was a dim-witted sea star [Patrick appears in a puppet outfit and looks a lot like the character, Pinocchio] who was about to stuff his fat face. [waves her wand with the word "Magics" fly by; her screen shows the Krusty Krab]
[At the Krusty Krab, Patrick comes out through the doors with a plate full of Krabby Patties. He takes a seat on a table and goes to eat his meal. Little did Patrick know, Plankton was observing him through a magnifying glass about his restaurant.]
Plankton: Hee, hee, hee. That idiot has such a huge pile of patties. I don't think he'll notice if one walks away. [laughs]
[Patrick continues to eat his lunch. Plankton flies into the patties and peaks out.]
Patrick: Aw, I need more ketchup. [hops out of his chair and runs back in for ketchup]
Plankton: Hmm… which patty to choose? This one? Nope. Too small. [throws away small patty] This one? Nope. Been chewed. [throws away chewed patty] This one? Nope. The seeds are missing. Hmm...
[Suddenly, the sun shines bright through Plankton's magnifying glass and burns him. Plankton screams and his body is on fire. Patrick comes out with a ketchup bottle and sits on top of Plankton.]
Plankton: Ow! Stand up, you moron!
[Patrick squeezes the ketchup bottle too hard and ketchup explodes everywhere. The ketchup flies in Patrick's eyes. Patrick panics and knocks over the table and the patties.]
Plankton: Get me an ice pack, you idiot!
Patrick: Where are you, Voice? [stretches his face and his eyes stretch out] Where are you? [sees SpongeBob, who is coming out of the restaurant]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick?
Patrick: [screams and his eyes pull back into his face] Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. I thought you were this crazy voice who keeps telling me what to do.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's probably your conscience.
Patrick: What are conscience? Are they bad?
SpongeBob: No. A conscience is a tiny voice inside you that tells you the difference between something that's right and something [gives Patrick a wedgie] that's wrong.
Patrick: So, I should do what the voice tells me to do?
SpongeBob: [pats Patrick's head] Now that's a smart little sea star. [leaves]
[Patrick giggles and swallows the plate full of patties. Plankton grins and gets an idea. He decides to take advantage of the opportunity by posing himself as Patrick's conscience so he'll get a Krabby Patty and now the formula. Plankton peels himself off of Patrick's butt and runs off. Patrick sips down some soda just as Plankton climbs up his shoulder in conscience disguise, which is the similar clothing to the character, Jiminy Cricket.]
Plankton: Patrick, this is your conscience speaking.
Patrick: Huh? [sees Plankton on his shoulder] Oh. [bows and drops Plankton in his soda] Nice to meet you, Conscience.
Plankton: [comes out of the soda] So stupid. So, Stupid, the first thing you need to do is buy some more Krabby Patties on the double. Hi-yah! Hey-yo!
Patrick: That'll be the first thing I do, Conscience!
Plankton: Yes!
Patrick: Right after I run some errands.
[Patrick pulls out a to-do list from his bellybutton and reads it.]
Plankton: Huh? [flings himself out of the cup] No! [kicks the soda] I'm calling the shots here. Now, get that Krabby Patty!
Patrick: I—I—It's just a little list! Please, Conscience?
Plankton: Alright, Pea-Brain. Make it quick.
Patrick: Number 1: High-five everyone! [waves his arm around with Plankton like he's playing a guitar] Huh!
Plankton: No, put me down first!
Patrick: High-five! [high-fives a civilian with Plankton in his hand] High-five! [high-fives another] Low-five! [low-fives a civilian] High-five! [high-fives SpongeBob] High-five! [high-fives a tough guy] High-five! [high-fives another] High-five! [high-fives another] High-five! [high-fives a realistic hand that punches Plankton]
[Plankton is squished and beaten up by the high-fives each person gave to Patrick. He liquifies into a puddle. Patrick slips on Plankton and falls on his face. Patrick giggles. Karen waves her wand to the next scene. The scene changes to Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat. The kids are in there eating ice cream sundaes and Goober meals. The mascot, Goofy Goober is greeting a little girl with a bowl of ice cream. Patrick and Plankton go up to the counter.]
Patrick: Number 2: Ice cream! Yeah! [waves his arm around with Plankton again and does his victory screech] One double chocolate molar blowout, please.
Goofy Goober waiter: One molar blowout, coming up!
Plankton: No! [pulls Patrick's tongue] You hate ice cream. You only want Krabby Patties. [hops into the soft serve ice cream machine] Hey you! Cancel that order!
[The Goofy Goober waiter pulls down the lever and swirls Plankton into a soft serve ice cream cone. He gives the cone to Patrick. Patrick begins to eat Plankton. Plankton bites Patrick's tongue.]
Patrick: [screams] Ow. You hate high-fives and ice cream? Are you sure you're my conscience? [looks at Plankton]
Plankton: I, uh, I'm absolutely positively your conscience. [his nose grows into Patrick's eye]
Patrick: Hey, doesn't your nose grow when you tell lies in fairy tales?
Plankton: Nope. Noses only grow when you make up the truth. [his nose grows longer] See?
Patrick: Ah-ha-ha! Oh, oh, I wanna make up the truth, too! Uh, I ate a hot air balloon for breakfast. [nothing happens] I—I—I mean, um, I did not eat a hot air balloon for breakfast. [his nose grows longer] Hey! I got a big nose too! Nose fight! En garde! [hits Plankton with his long nose]
[Patrick and Plankton engage a nose sword fight and the kids cheer. Plankton hits Patrick and makes him knock over a table. The triple gooberberry sunrise sundae flies into the Goofy Goober waiter's face. He is covered in ice cream.]
Children: Uh-oh.
Goofy Goober waiter: Hooray!
[The kids, Goofy Goober, and Patrick cheer. Patrick and Plankton resume their nose sword fight. Plankton pokes Patrick's butt with his nose and sends him rolling towards the counter. Patrick crashes into the counter and splatters ice cream all over the place. The Goofy Goober waiter is covered in ice cream and looks like a snowman.]
Children: Uh-oh.
[The ice cream melts off of the Goofy Goober waiter. He looks down and sees Patrick and Plankton.]
Patrick and Plankton: Sorry.
[The Goofy Goober waiter is really angry and his ice cream cone pupils melt in fury. He kicks Patrick and Plankton out, sending them flying into the street. Patrick and Plankton fall on their noses and they break off.]
Plankton: Time to let your conscience be your guide. Give me that list! [goes into Patrick's bellybutton, grabs the list, crosses out everything and writes something down] Here! [gives Patrick the list]
Patrick: Hey, only one errand left! [leans back and forth and plays his air guitar] Gotta give Plankton a Krabby Patty! [fireworks explode above him]
Plankton: [shakes his hat off, waves his blond hair and plays his air guitar] Oh, yeah! Yeah!
[The scene changes to Patrick and Plankton arriving at the Chum Bucket with a Krabby Patty.]
Patrick: I wonder why I wanted to give Plankton a patty?
Plankton: Why not Plankton? He's a sweetheart. [his nose grows long and Plankton clips it off] And as your conscience, I demand you toss that patty in the mail slot!
Patrick: Oh, I love mail slot toss! [attempts to throw the patty in the mail slot, but he misses as it bounces upwards]
Plankton: Not so hard! [slaps Patrick] Huh? [sees the patty land on Pearl's picnic basket who is going to the beach with her friends]
Pearl: I've been wanting to hit the beach all week. [laughs]
Pearl and her friends: Goo Lagoon! Goo Lagoon! [drive away to Goo Lagoon]
Plankton: Huh? [his mouth falls in shock; Plankton forms another idea and a lightbulb lights up above his head. He pastes his mouth back on] Ah-ha! Patrick, please promptly pursue Plankton's patty! [points to lightbulb] Get the idea?
Patrick: Uh, uh. [strains himself as a lightbulb appears on his head; but it burns out and Patrick drolls]
[Plankton groans, grabs a ladder, and climbs up to Patrick's head.]
Plankton: How many plankton does it take to change a lightbulb? [unscrews the burnt lightbulb and replaces it with a new one] One. [climbs down, pulls Patrick's tooth and the lightbulb lights]
Patrick: [wakes up] Huh? Now I get the idea! Whoo! [waves his arm around again] Gotta follow that patty!
[Patrick runs off to follow Pearl and her friends to Goo Lagoon. Plankton is trampled by Patrick's feet and gets up.]
Plankton: Wait for me, you pink pinhead! [gets blown away by the wind]
[The scene changes to Goo Lagoon. Pearl lays by to rest in the sun. Patrick and Plankton arrive by digging under the sand. They tunnel past several beach goers along the way. They hit Tyler's beach umbrella. They hit Fred.]
Fred: Ow! Hey, watch it!
[They hit another beach goer who is sipping a drink. Plankton pops out of the sand and spit some of it out. Patrick pops out of the sand and spits out a volley ball. Pearl nearly sucks her umbrella in her mouth while she sleeps.]
Plankton: There's Blubber Mouth.
[Pearl sucks the umbrella in her mouth and swallow it in her sleep.]
Patrick: There's Plankton's patty!
Plankton: You know what to do.
Patrick: Do I? [gets slapped by Plankton] Oh yeah!
[Patrick digs towards Pearl and goes to grab the patty. The patty falls off the picnic roll into Pearl's mouth. Plankton escapes and falls on the sand. But Pearl has swallowed the patty whole.]
Plankton: [groans] Oh, well. No patty for Plankton. [sobs]
Patrick: Huh! I'm going in! Hi-yah! [jumps into Pearl's mouth and goes down her throat]
Plankton: Ugh. Just being near a whale's mouth gives me the creeps. [gets and pulled into Pearl's mouth by Patrick; Patrick and Plankton fall deep down Pearl's throat and Patrick screams] Quiet, you fool! You'll wake up Pearl.
[Patrick and Plankton land in Pearl's stomach. Pearl feels a bit of painfulness and goes back to sleep. Patrick gets scared and cowers in fear.]
Patrick: This is snug.
Plankton: Mother always said I'd end up in a whale's belly. Or prison.
Geppetto: Hey! Who-a goes-a there?
Patrick: Who goes where?
Geppetto: [comes out from his tent] The name's-a Geppetto. Take off your hats and stay a while.
Plankton: We don't have time for a visit, old man. We're just trying to find a sandwich.
Geppetto: Sandwich? No, I haven't seen anything like that around-a here in months. [his nose grows]
Patrick: Hey, Geppetto, what's that behind your back?
Plankton: Is that our Krabby Patty?
Geppetto: Nope. [his nose grows longer] Oh! [punches his nose back in his face]
Plankton: [jumps on Geppetto's shoulder and grabs the patty] Ah-ha! I got the patty!
Patrick: [grabs Geppetto's wig] Ah-ha! I got the wig! [puts it on his head]
Geppetto: [goes in his tent] Son, they're-a stealing our food!
[Geppetto pulls out an unfinished wooden puppet he calls Pinocchio.]
Pinocchio: Who's stealing our food, Pop? Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!
[Patrick and Plankton look at each other in puzzlement.]
Geppetto: Get 'em, Pinocchio!
[Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio get into a brawl. Geppetto ties Plankton and Patrick in puppet strings. They brawl again and they all get tangled up in puppet strings. They brawl again and they all play jump rope like children. They stop and resume their brawl. Their fighting causes Pearl to get a horrible taste of indigestion and her stomach growls in pain.]
Pearl: Oh, no. A stomach ache at the beach? That's no fun! I wish it would go away.
[Karen magically appears next to Pearl.]
Karen: Your wish is granted. Hold out your hand! [waves her wand and poof up a bottle of Gush and Flush stomach reliever]
Pearl: Wow! What is this?
Karen: For fast relief of indigestion, try Gush and Flush. And wash your pain down the drain. [whispers] And my stupid husband, while you're at it.
Pearl: [drinks the stomach reliever] Ah.
[Pearl's stomach growls. Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio continue to fight until they get caught in a torrent of stomach reliever. Pearl blasts the stomach reliever out from her blowhole, sending Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio out of her body.]
Pearl: Thank you, Extra Strength Gush and Flush! [giggles and winks]
Geppetto: Pinocchio, we're-a free-a! Free-a!
[Pinocchio waves his arm around while Geppetto sings his heart out. Suddenly, a giant clam comes out and swallows them both.]
Plankton: Huh? [gets up] Don't worry about the patty, Patrick. I'll take it to Plankton myself, like a good little conscience. [picks up the patty] See ya!
[Plankton goes to return to the Chum Bucket with the patty, but bumps into a small yellow starfish who turns out to be Patrick's real conscience.]
Patrick's conscience: Oh, uh, hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Eh, my conscience?
Plankton: Your wha?
Patrick's conscience: Yep, I'm Patrick's conscience. But I overslept.
Patrick: Well, if you're my conscience conscience, then who's that?
Patrick's conscience: It's a bug! Step on it!
[Patrick rapidly steps on Plankton with his foot.]
Karen: And they all lived happily ever after. So, until next time, this is—
Plankton: Karen!
Karen: The Computer Fairy hoping all your dreams come true.
[Karen waves her wand and her screen goes back to the storybook. The last page says "All Your Dreams Come True" on it. The scene zooms in Karen's screen to go to the storybook.]
Pinocchio: [appears on screen] Let me at 'em, Pop! Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em! Let me—
[The book closes onto Pinocchio and the cover says the title, "The End" on it.]
Pinocchio: Ow.


[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is reading a catalog with his snail, Gary.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, take a look a this, Gare Bear. Found a slime ball in your shoe? Even purebred snails call fall victim to the scourge of slime balls. [puts the catalog on the table and flips his glasses in his head]
[Gary hacks and spits out a slime ball. SpongeBob catches the slime ball with a catcher's mitt.]
SpongeBob: You really got some air on that one.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I know that meow. That says, "I'm hungry." [flips his chair over to reveal Gary's food bowl] Lucky for you, I speak fluent snail. [sticks out a can of snail food from his mouth and dumps some food in Gary's bowl]
Gary: [pouts] Meow!
SpongeBob: What, you're not hungry?
Gary: [kicks the food bowl in SpongeBob's face] Meow-meow!
SpongeBob: [whips the food off with his nose] Oh, of course. [opens his face and pulls out a leash] You wanna go for a walk? [closes his face] Gary, you really need to work on your pronunciation.
[SpongeBob goes to put the leash on Gary. But Gary backs away. SpongeBob tries again, but fails. Then the two start a brawl, which ended with SpongeBob getting tangled in the leash.]
SpongeBob: Okay, no walkies. [pulls the leash off]
[Gary angrily meows at SpongeBob and pushes him against the table. The catalog falls off the table.]
SpongeBob: Oh, if only you could talk like a real person. [Gary points at something in the catalog] Huh? Ooh! [reads] "The chatterbox translation collar? Know what your best friend is saying!" A snail translator! That's a great idea, Gary. [picks up the phone and calls the chatterbox salesman]
Chatterbox salesperson: [filing her nails] Chatterbox order line.
SpongeBob: Hello, yes, could you please send me one chatterbox snail collar?
Chatterbox salesperson: Do you want regular, express, or our fastest delivery option time warp?
SpongeBob: Ooh, time warp, please!
Chatterbox salesperson: Very well, your package was delivered last Thursday.
[SpongeBob hangs up the phone, turns around, and gasps as he sees a huge box in the middle of the floor.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I wonder where this came from.
[Gary slithers off the box and SpongeBob opens it. He dumps out the styrofoam, which is formed into a cube. He touches it and styrofoam explodes in his face. SpongeBob inhales the styrofoam and holds up the new translation collar.]
SpongeBob: Oh, here we go. [puts the collar on Gary's shell] Okay, Gary, speak to me.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Check, check. [Gary meows] One, two. Ah, that's more like it. Hello, there, Papa Bob.
SpongeBob: [tears up] Papa Bob. Oh! Oh, Gary, now you can express you innermost thoughts in language I can understand. [holds up diary] I have so many questions.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Lay 'em on me, Papa Bob.
SpongeBob: What do you dream about?
[As Gary explains, he is shown flying in the sky with jellyfish.]
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Mostly, I dream of flying above it all...
SpongeBob: Aww, that's sweet.
Gary's collar: While I breathe fiery destruction upon my enemies.
[Gary breathes fire on the town of Bikini Bottom and the townspeople scream and run in terror. The vision ends and SpongeBob gets very scared.]
SpongeBob: [gulps] Hey, if you're gonna dream, dream big, right? [clears throat] Let's move on to question two, shall we? What are your long-term goals?
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] To finish restoring my hotrod.
[Gary's hotrod is shown sputtering and firing up its engines. One tail pipe falls off.]
SpongeBob: Yeah, you need to get on that. But what I really want to know is, [turns upside-down and shakes his butt] how do I look in these pants?
[Gary's eyes look squared until he shakes his head.]
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] They really bring out the sharp corners of your buttocks.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you flatterer. Come on, Gare, let's show Patrick your new voice. [meets up with Patrick outside] Oh, Patrick, I have got a surprise for you! [laughs] Say hello to Gary.
Patrick: [shakes Gary's eyestalk] Hello, Gary.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Hello, stinky man.
Patrick: Hmm? Hmm. [smells his really stinky armpit and his head melts] Phew! Ooh, you're right, Gary, I am ripe! [grabs a trashcan and dumps garbage onto himself] Ah, much better.
Gary's collar: [Gary sniffs and meows] Delightfully disgusting.
Patrick: Thank you, my good man.
[The scene changes to Sandy leaving the Bikini Bottom Dentist Office.]
Sandy: Thanks for the old tooth scrubbing! Bye!
SpongeBob: Sandy! Gary has a new translating collar.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Hello, hairy astronaut lady.
Sandy: How do you do, little fella? [pets Gary]
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] You know, same shell, different day.
SpongeBob: Isn't it amazing?
Sandy: Aww, that ain't nothing. I invented a nut translator ages ago. [puts a nut translator on a walnut]
Walnut: [through nut translator] The pistachios are all out to get me. You can't trust 'em. They're working for the peanut mafia!
Sandy: [laughs] Walnuts are extra nutty.
[The scene changes to Squidward meditating in his house.]
Squidward: Om.
Master Marty: [on television] In order to achieve complete brainfulness, one must clear one's mind of all distractions.
[The doorbell rings.]
Master Marty: [on television] Distractions are only in your mind.
[The doorbell continues to ring and Squidward grumbles.]
Master Marty: [on television] You are the center of the universe.
[The doorbell rings again.]
Squidward: Center of the universe.
[The doorbell continues to ring and Squidward grumbles.]
Master Marty: [pops out of the TV] Will you answer the door already?!
[SpongeBob continues to ring the doorbell until Squidward answers.]
SpongeBob: I think your doorbell's broken, Squidward.
Squidward: What do you want?
SpongeBob: I thought you might want to chat with your neighbor.
Squidward: Why would I want to talk to you?
SpongeBob: Oh, not to me. [holds up Gary] To Gary.
Squidward: Oh, good grief. SpongeBob, Gary can't talk. He's a snail!
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Greetings and salutations, grouchy man.
Squidward: Wha-ha?
SpongeBob: I bought Gary the new pet translator collar.
Squidward: Why would you want to talk to him?
SpongeBob: Who wouldn't want to talk to their pet?
Squidward: I was talking to Gary.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows and enters Squidward's house] Oh. Those walls! That carpet.
SpongeBob: Turns out Gary has a very sophisticated sense of design.
Squidward: Really? [slams the door in SpongeBob's face] Well, maybe I'll give him a guided tour.
[SpongeBob flips himself over to the other side of the door and falls into Squidward's floor.]
SpongeBob: Hey, wait up!
[Squidward leads Gary upstairs in his painting gallery.]
Squidward: And up here, you'll find my true masterworks. Hidden away from the eyes of the undeserving public.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Ah, the naïve cephalopod style. Not very sophisticated.
Squidward: Huh? [grumbles as his face turns red] See here.
[Gary looks through Squidward's closet and SpongeBob takes notes on Gary's thoughts.]
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Ugh! Tacky.
Squidward: Hold on now!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward, I'm taking notes for you. [Squidward whacks the notebook out of SpongeBob's hand]
Master Marty: [on television] Fell the plainfulness flow through you.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] You watch this nonsense?
Squidward: What? What's wrong with it?
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Nothing, I'm sure. Apparently, no brain required. Come, Papa Bob. Let's get out of here before this bad taste rubs off on us.
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, gee, do you have to?
SpongeBob: Don't be sad, Squidward, we'll be back soon.
[SpongeBob and Gary head out the door and Squidward grumbles in anger.]
Master Marty: [on television] Until next time, remember to free yourself from all distraction. [vanishes]
Squidward: [grins evilly] Oh, I will. [snickers]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob getting ready for bed.]
SpongeBob: [yawns] Night, Gare Bear.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Good night, Papa Bob.
[SpongeBob claps his hands and the lights turn off. As SpongeBob and Gary sleep, Squidward is on the ceiling watching from above.]
Squidward: Good night. [slides down the wall with his suction cups and sneaks up on a sleeping Gary] Now, let's see if SpongeBob still wants you to talk after tonight. [steals the translator collar, takes out a fake one with a walkie-talkie on it, and slips it on to Gary's shell]
[Squidward snickers evilly and exits SpongeBob's room through the window. As he gets to the ground, he steps on a rake and gets smacked in the face with it.]
Squidward: [screams and pulls the rake off his face] Stupid rake! [speaks through walkie-talkie] Oh, Papa Bob. [clears throat] No, no, no. [clears throat and talks in a snooty voice] Oh, Papa Bob. [Gary's still sleeping] I'm thirsty.
SpongeBob: [moans] At this hour? All right, I'll get you some water. [slides off his bed and rolls to the bathroom; then comes back with a glass of water] Here you go, buddy, one water. [places it in Gary's bowl and prepares to go back to bed]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] I want to go to the park.
SpongeBob: Huh? Oh, sure. No problem, Gary. [yelps as he tries to stay awake]
[SpongeBob falls over, puts Gary on his back and slithers to the front door. Moments later, SpongeBob and Gary, still half-asleep, comes back from their walk.]
SpongeBob: Well, that was fun. [puts Gary in his bed and prepares himself to go to sleep]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] My bed is too lumpy.
SpongeBob: All right, then. [slips off his bed again and picks up Gary] Here, Gary, take my bed, hmm? [puts Gary on his bed and goes to sleep on the floor]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] Papa Bob, it's hot in here. [snickers]
[SpongeBob opens his bedroom window.]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] Still too stuffy.
SpongeBob: Still too— [takes out a sledge hammer and pounds a hole on the wall; the wind blows in] How's that, Gary?
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] The view is so much nicer a block away.
SpongeBob: Okay, okay.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob lifting his house up with a jackscrew and putting wheels on it.]
SpongeBob: This should get things rolling. [kicks the jackscrew out from under the house and pushes it out onto the road]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] Keep going. Just a little more. [snickers and looks through binoculars] Perfect.
[SpongeBob stops on a hill and is completely exhausted.]
SpongeBob: [gasps as he sees a comet flying across the sky] You're right, Gary. The view is nicer over here. Gary? [sees his house rolling down the hill] Gary! [screams]
[SpongeBob's house rolls down into Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob chases after his house and clings onto the lower window. He opens his front door and climbs back inside. The house rolls down the road and runs through a red light, which also causes pile-ups. The house crashes into several buildings. SpongeBob screams as he sees danger signs about a steep cliff the house is heading to. SpongeBob jumps out through the hole and slows the house down with his shoes.]
SpongeBob: [his shoes ignite and burn, making him barefooted] Whoa! [screams] Oh-whoa-oh! Look out! Look out! [whimpers as he clings onto his house]
[The house stops slowly and dangles over the cliff. SpongeBob clings onto the front wheel and pulls himself to safety on the cliff.]
SpongeBob: Whew! Aww, that was close, huh, Gary? [he accidentally leans onto his house and it rolls off the cliff] Oops.
[SpongeBob's house rolls far out into the distance. The scene changes to the next morning. SpongeBob and Gary are deeply upset that their house is gone, leaving them nothing but a dirt circle on the ground.]
SpongeBob: Aww, now where are we gonna sleep? [sobs]
[Squidward snicks as he pulls up a brick wall.]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] You could always live in a hole, like that idiot sea star.
[As SpongeBob continues to cry, Gary discovers the fake collar on his shell. He looks around.]
Gary: Meow?
[Gary discovers Squidward laughing to himself behind the wall, holding a walkie-talkie. He glares at Squidward and sees a sobbing SpongeBob digging a hole. At that instant, Gary realizes that  Squidward is responsible for the loss of SpongeBob's house and growls angrily at him. Gary decides to teach Squidward a lesson and slithers over to him. As Squidward continues to laugh, Gary pulls to fake collar back and launches it into Squidward's mouth, making him choke on it and then swallow it. Gary then meows through the walkie-talkie to make Squidward sound like a snail. SpongeBob digs deeper in the hole as his house suddenly appears above him and rolls back into place. The house falls on SpongeBob and he comes out through the door.]
SpongeBob: My house! Oh, Squidward, we're neighbors again. [hugs Squidward]
Squidward: [pulls SpongeBob off] Get off of—
Gary: [through walkie-talkie] Meow.
[Squidward covers his mouth.]
SpongeBob: Uh, I didn't catch that, Squidward, what'd you say?
Squidward: I said, "Get off of"—
Gary: [through walkie-talkie] Meow.
[Gary continues to meow through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body until it attracts the attention of a pedestrian with his worm. The worm growls, barks and runs over to Squidward.]
Nat Peterson: Hey!
[Squidward becomes scared and runs away as Gary meows through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body.]
Nat Peterson: Hey! Come back with my worm!
[Squidward runs into the pet park with several angry worms following after him. As Gary continues to meow through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body, Squidward gets himself cornered by the worms. Gary hisses through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body. All of the worms pile up on Squidward and begin to maul on him.]
SpongeBob: Aww, looks like Squidward wants a pet of his own to talk to.
Gary: [smooth voice] Meow. [laughs and smiles]


[The episode begins at a local circus. A giant jellyfish and an elephant snail are performing in the center ring. The elephant snail makes its loud trumpet roar, spitting saliva onto SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: I heart the circus! [laughs]
Ringmaster: Children of all ages! Get ready to wet your baggy pants laughing! Send in the clowns! [grabs his assistant and uses him like a whip] He-yah!
[A small car enters the center ring. It drives around and around until several clowns come out.]
Ringmaster: Our candy-corn-fed clowns once roamed the slapstick plains where wild clowns run free! [grabs his assistant and uses him as a whip again] He-yah! [the clowns line up; he whips them again] He-yah! [the clowns form into a pyramid; he whips them again] He-yah! [the clowns form into a ferris wheel; he whips them again] He-yah! [the clowns form into a balloon donkey; it brays and explodes]
[The clowns wave at the audience.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [cheering wildly]
Patrick: Look, there's those!
SpongeBob: [sees a small clown] Oh. Are you hungry, little clown? [tries to feed the little clown a piece of popcorn, but the ringmaster whips them]
Ringmaster: He-yah! DON'T FEED THE CLOWNS!
SpongeBob: [melts in his body] Why not?
Patrick: Huh? [pulls SpongeBob together] SpongeBob, are you mad? Clowns are dangerous animals. Why, at any moment, one of those things could get loose and bite our feet off! [pulls off his feet]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, that little clown wouldn't do that. He was friendly.
[The little clown waves at the audience until he notices his clown friends climbing back into their car. The little clown pushes the bigger clown in the car and follows them in. The car crashes into a pole and the clowns fall out unconscious. An ambulance drives into the ring. Two paramedics come out with a stretcher. SpongeBob and Patrick biting their nails in worry. The paramedics carry the clowns to the ambulance. The little clown climb on to the top, takes out a flower and pretends to die. Then wakes up and waves to the audience. The audience laughs.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] I wanna go backstage and see the clowns, Patrick.
Patrick: I told you, SpongeBob, our feet are in danger!
SpongeBob: [grabs Patrick just as he was about to leave] I'll protect you.
[SpongeBob drags Patrick backstage and hides behind some crates.]
SpongeBob: Ooh.
[The clowns walk into a pen as if they were farm animals. The clowns lick themselves, pick on each other's hair and sniff around. The little clown walks up and takes off his hat.]
Little Clown: Huh?
[The tall clown takes his foot and pushes the little clown, sending him flying to the ding bell.]
SpongeBob: Poor little guy.
[The ringmaster dumps candy in a bin and whistles for the clowns. The clowns run up and eat the candy like animals. The little clown wants to eat some, but couldn't get in between the bigger clowns. The big clowns walk away, leaving the little clown with no food.]
SpongeBob: Hey, he didn't get any food. Hmm. [sneaks away and walks up to the sad, little clown] Hey, psst!
Little Clown: Huh? [hooing happily as SpongeBob is about to feed him popcorn]
[SpongeBob dumps popcorn in the little clown's hands, but the ringmaster catches them and whips them.]
Ringmaster: DON'T FEED THE CLOWNS!
[SpongeBob screams and runs away from the circus with Patrick.]
Patrick: My feet!
Ringmaster: Pack it up, everyone. [whips again] He-yah!
[The clowns fold up the tent like an umbrella and pack up all of their props. The little clown attempted to help, but he gets stepped on and pushed around by the other clowns. The clowns load up the car, including the elephant snail, and begin to drive away. The little clown gets up and tries to catch up to the circus, but they kept on driving. The little clown is now lost and alone. The scene changes to SpongeBob dragging a bag of popcorn the next morning.]
SpongeBob: I don't care what that mean old ringmaster says. That clown is hungry, and I'm gonna feed him. [sees cotton candy flying everywhere, but the circus is not there] Hey, where'd the circus go? Now I'll never find that little clown.
[SpongeBob trips over something and drops his bag of popcorn. He gets up and sees the little clown. The little clown gets scared and squirts SpongeBob with his flower.]
SpongeBob: [gets choked on with water and gulps it down] There you are.
[The little clown squeaks.]
SpongeBob: Hey, little clown. The circus left without you! Quick, we gotta get you back to your clown friends. [tries to get the little clown moving, but the clown refused to budge] Oh, you don't want to go back to the circus?
[The little clown shakes his head, saying "no."]
SpongeBob: You don't want to be a circus clown?
[The little clown holds out a circus pennant and eats it. He then waves his hand in front of his face and makes his frown into a smile.]
SpongeBob: You know, little clown, I don't blame you. You shouldn't stay in a place where they push you around all the time. Looks like I'll have to help you find a new job. But what else can you do?
[The little clown points to a hot dog stand.]
SpongeBob: Oh, you want to work there? [the little clown nods his head, saying "yes."] This job should be a snap, little clown. Watch me. [shows the little clown how to make a hot dog] ♪Pick up the hot dog, put it in a bun, add the mustard, relish, now you're having fun♪ [the little clown eats the hot dog]
Customers: Oh-ho-ho, hot dog! Look at that. [holds up money] Looks like fun!
SpongeBob: [quietly] Okay, you're on.
[The little clown takes out several hot dogs without the tongs. The hog dogs burn the little clown's hand and juggles them. He throws the hot dogs in the customers eyes, which causes them to scream. The little clown squirts mustard in the customers mouths with his flower. The customers run off until the hot dog vendor arrives.]
Vendor: My wieners! [growls]
SpongeBob: Oh, is this your cart? Sorry.
[The vendor grabs SpongeBob and the little clown. He stuffs SpongeBob in a bun like a hot dog and sprits the little clown on him like mustard. The vendor throws SpongeBob and the little clown away. The scene changes to SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: I think you'll get a job a lot quicker if we tone down the whole clown thing a smidge. Don't worry. When I get through with you, your own ringmaster won't recognize you.
[Several balloon animals pop on the screen. SpongeBob shaves the little clown's hair. He turns the little clown's pants strap into a tie. He puts a tuxedo on the little clown and replaces the clown's shoes with regular shoes. SpongeBob smooches himself and shows the little clown his new look. SpongeBob puts one more detail on the clown: a mustache. The little clown is happy and claps. The scene changes to a department building.]
SpongeBob: "Businessmen wanted." [opens the door] Go get 'em, little clown. Oh, I mean, Mr. Little Clown. [laughs as the little clown enters the building]
[The little clown presents himself to the CEO.]
CEO: Hmm? [grabs the little clown and puts him in his work station] Here's your stool. And here's your stamper. Now get to work.
[The little clown begins his job and stamps several paperwork.]
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Aww. [sheds a tear and leaves]
[The little clown continues stamping the papers. He then stamps the papers with his feet. Then he stamps ink all over his face. He stamps his face onto the papers. He jumps on the conveyor belt and hops up and down. He stamps a checkmark on two employers and a no sign on another. A security guard drags the employer with the no sign out. The CEO hears the commotion.]
CEO: Hmm?
[He sees the little clown stamping his buttocks on the papers and making a total mess. He growls and pulls the conveyor belt down towards him.]
CEO: Who hired this clown?!
CEO's assistant: Um, you did, sir.
[The little clown squeaks. The CEO gets really mad and explodes a mushroom cloud over his head.]
CEO: Fired!
[The little clown screams and runs out of the building. SpongeBob is flipping a coin until the little clown runs into him.]
SpongeBob: What happened, little clown? Didn't you like that job?
[The little clown nods his head, saying "no", blows up a whoopee cushion and presses on it.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. [sees a fire hydrant] Ooh!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob taking the little clown, who is now dressed in his firefighting outfit, to the Bikini Bottom Fire Department.]
SpongeBob: Maybe a career in firefighting.
[SpongeBob opens the door and the little clown goes in the fire department. The fire engine drives out with the little clown.]
SpongeBob: Have a nice fire! [the little clown waves a SpongeBob; SpongeBob goes to leave until he stops] I'll just make sure he gets there safely. [smacks his head and his bump glows red; then he makes siren sounds]
[The fire engine drives up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School as it is completely on fire. The ladder crashes into the school's burning sign and firefighters struggle to put out the fire. The little clown clings onto the hose as SpongeBob arrives at the scene.]
SpongeBob: [mimics siren sounds] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Not Mrs. Puff's Boating School!
Mrs. Puff: [sticks herself out the window] Save me! Save me! I'm too young to broil!
[The little clown screams and grabs a bucket. He climbs up a ladder and instead of saving her and putting out the fire, he throws confetti in her face. The entire boating school becomes engulfed in flames until everything is burnt to a crisp.]
Mrs. Puff: [panting and puffs herself up] You're fired!
[Mrs. Puff's outburst causes the little clown to fall to the ground. The scene changes to SpongeBob and the little clown at the bakery.]
SpongeBob: This is it, little clown. The last job available in Bikini Bottom. [puts a chef's hat on the little clown's head]
[The little clown whimpers and gets really nervous.]
SpongeBob: If you can just stop the clowning for two minutes, you'll have a job. Please! Sorry, little clown. It's been a long day. [laughs feebly] Good luck. [laughs]
[The little clown waves his hand at his face and makes his frown become a smile. The little clown enters the bakery and SpongeBob peeks through the window.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [sees through donuts] Hmm. [gets blocked by a cake] Hmm. Aha! [pushes out his eyeballs] Now get in there, eyes, and stay close to that clown.
[SpongeBob's eyeballs run into the bakery and go to watch over the little clown.]
Head baker: Your job is to pack up the pies! now get to work
[The little clown salutes in agreement.]
Head baker: Hmm! [leaves]
[SpongeBob's eyeballs hide behind some boxes. The little clowns sniffs some pies. He remembers how he used to throw pies at the clowns as part of his act at the circus. He also remember how he loved getting himself pied in the face. He looks over at the head baker, who is busy baking, and goes over to throw a pie at him. SpongeBob's eyeballs yelp in fear.]
SpongeBob: No! No, little clown! No! [runs into the bakery]
[As the little clown prepares to throw the pie, SpongeBob comes in the kitchen. The little clown throws the pie.]
SpongeBob: [slow motion] No! [gets pied in the face] Phew! [laughs]
[The little clown pies the head baker in the face. He starts to act crazy and throws pies all over the place. He throws pies at three bakers and several customers waiting in line outside.]
SpongeBob: Hot pepper pie?!
[Nat Peterson gets pied with the hot pepper pie and his face burns and melts off.]
SpongeBob: Lemon pie?!
[A little kid gets pied with the lemon pie and her face sours up.]
SpongeBob: Honey pie?!
[Fred gets pied with the honey pie.]
Fred: [licks some honey] Mmm! [gets stung by jellyfish until his face is swollen]
[The little clown grabs SpongeBob's eyes and stuffs them in a pie. Then he throws the pie with the eyeballs in them at SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Eye pie!
[The head baker gets really angry. The pie batter hardens up around him and cracks into pieces. He growls and grinds his teeth.]
Head baker: You... Are...
SpongeBob: Fired?
[The head baker grabs SpongeBob and the little clown. He rolls them up into a batter and forms them into pie. He then puts them both into a box and ties them up.]
Head baker: Au revoir!
[The head baker rings the bell and a deliver man takes it. He drives his pie truck away from the bakery and gives the pie to a lady sitting on the bench.]
Tina Fran: Huh? I didn't order a pie. [opens the box and SpongeBob and the little clown pop out; scaring her away]
SpongeBob: Oh, little clown, I'm so sorry. I thought you needed a day job, but you're a clown. And a clown needs to run free.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and the little clown traveling through the kelp forest. SpongeBob chops through the kelp with his knife. He peeks through the kelp and reveals a colorful world full of clowns. Clowns are riding on balloon animals, eating candy for food, throwing pies at eating other, and doing other crazy things clowns do at the circus. The little clown was so happy and hugs SpongeBob. He joins the other clowns, who examine him by sniffing him. The spray water at him and the other clown throws at pie at his friend. The little clown takes out a hammer and smacks the other clown with it.]
SpongeBob: Aww. [gets pie splattered on his pants]
[The little clown waves good-bye to SpongeBob and runs off to join the other clowns.]
SpongeBob: Aww. [sheds a tear and gets pied in the face]
[The little clown squeaks one last time and SpongeBob laughs.]

Kid #1: It's too high. I can't!
Kid #2: Cannonball! [jumps on the diving board]
Kid #1: Ohh!
[The bigger kid jumps into the pool and causes a big wave, splashing everything. A parent puts water wings on her daughter's arms.]

[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
SpongeBob: Marco!
[Patrick swims over to a group of senior citizens.]
Nurse: [blows whistle] Shady Shoals residents, out of the pool!
Old Man #1: I pooped.
Clarabelle: Come along, Mortimer. [blinks her old eyes and pulls Patrick out of the pool]
Patrick: Huh? [notices his wrinkled up body] Oh. Huh? I'm covered in wrinkles.
Clarabelle: Oh, we all are, dear. I call them oldie foldies. [flips her flabby arm] Hurry, Mortimer. Shady Shoals is serving prune ice cream today.
Patrick: Dah! Ice cream, oh, oh! [runs up to the bus, knocking over Clarabelle and an old man] Wait for me! [gets in the bus and it drives away, dragging Clarabelle and the old man in the back]
SpongeBob: Marco! Marco! [touches Marco's face] Marco?
Marco: [grumbles and grabs SpongeBob] Yeah, I'm-a Marco! What do you want?
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't want you. I want Patrick.
Marco: Then stop a-yellin' my name! [drops SpongeBob and leaves]
SpongeBob: Ugh. [softly] Marco.
Larry: [through a megaphone while holding an old man licking a lollipop] Attention, everyone. We found a lost elderly gentleman who goes by the name of Mortimer. Can anyone claim him? [gets no answer and stuffs Mortimer in a lost and found box]
[The bus drives up to Shady Shoals where it is about to drop the senior citizens off.]

Clarabelle: Mortimer, ice cream time.
Patrick: [gets up] Ahh! [pants as he runs to the table, pushes everyone aside and eats the prune ice cream; he belches out the three bowls then starts to feel pain in his head] Brain freeze!
[Patrick's head opens and his brain is covered in ice and snow. Patrick passes out unconscious on the floor.]
Nurse: Clear! [zaps Patrick with the defibrillator] Clear! [zaps Patrick's brain with the defibrillator, but his brain ignites fire; she whimpers and backs away]
[Patrick's brain is burnt to a crisp and the smoke wakes Patrick up.]
Patrick: Oh. [gets up] Ah. [picks up his brain, squirts it with ketchup and eats it] Brain food.

SpongeBob: Marco!
[Marco grumbles and climbs down the fire escape.]
SpongeBob: Marco!
Marco: You! What I tell youse about-a yellin' my name?
SpongeBob: Ahh! I-I don't remember. Um, sometimes it helps me to remember if I go into a trance. [rubs his head and shows his brain, then a white farmhouse] I'm seeing a small farmhouse painted white. Does that have any significance to you?
Marco: My parents had a white farmhouse.
SpongeBob: What's this? A baby has been born. A boy. There is much happiness.
Marco: That's-a me. I was-a born there.
SpongeBob: They are about to name the boy...
Marco: Marco. They named him Marco. It's Marco. Marco!
SpongeBob: Polo.
Marco: Ahh! [grabs SpongeBob] If I catch anyone a-yellin' my name again, I'm-a gonna hurt them. [throws SpongeBob away]
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! [screams and lands right in front of Shady Shoals where a sleeping Patrick is now old and wrinkly; gets up] Marco.
Patrick: Polo.
SpongeBob: Ah-ha-ha! Found you! Now it's your turn to call Marco.
Patrick: [wakes up] Do I know you, young man?
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me. Remember? ♪Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?♪

SpongeBob: [pulls up a tub, jumps in and absorbs the water] ♪Absorbent and yellow and porous is he♪ [spits out the water] Ehh.
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob: [plays the final notes with his nose like a flute and laughs] The one and only. Okay, now it's your turn to call Marco Polo.
Patrick: Whoa-oh, I can't do that. I'm all wrinkled now. I do old stuff. [his forehead and eyebrows fall on his face]
SpongeBob: Old stuff? Like what?
Patrick: [lifts up his forehead and eyebrows] Check it out. [shows SpongeBob a rocking chair] This is called doddering. [slowly dodders to the rocking chair] Oh, here's another thing I do now. It's called gumming. [smacks his gums and lips] Neat, huh? [laughs] Now, uh, this part's really fun. It's called complaining. [grabs Joshua] These kids today, they don't know diddly squat!
[Joshua's mother grabs her son and drags him away.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, those are all great things, but wouldn't you rather go jellyfishing? [holds up a jellyfishing net]
Patrick: [imagines a jellyfish and it stings him] Ohh! No, that hurts.
SpongeBob: We could build sandcastles. [holds up a toy shovel]
Patrick: [imagines a sandcastle and someone kicks it in Patrick's neck] It's not structurally sound.
SpongeBob: Well, how 'bout blowing bubbles? [holds up a bottle of bubble with a bubble wand] Nothing bad about a bubble.
Patrick: [imagines a bubble and it floats in front of him] Ooh. [it pops in his face] Are you trying to kill me, son?
SpongeBob: No, I just think we should act our age. [forms a cushion fort and pops out at the bottom] Remember when we used to look forward to rainy days and building cushion forts?
Patrick: These days, I only look forward to my final exit. [goes into a cushion coffin]
Clarabelle: Oh, he was too young. [puts flowers on the cushion coffin]
Patrick: [pops out] No, I wasn't!
Senior Citizens: No, he wasn't. [climbs in the cushion coffin] We are not young.
SpongeBob: Come on, people. Just 'cause you're old doesn't mean you're rotting fish. You're still vital, full of life. Fresh.
Old Man #2: Fresh, you say? Ahh. [his mouth rips off]
[SpongeBob pulls Patrick and the senior citizens out of Shady Shoals as they sit on a rug. He drags them to a nearby coral tree.]
SpongeBob: Okay, you young-at-hearters, today you are gonna climb that tree.
[Patrick and the senior citizens get up and attempt to climb it.]
SpongeBob: [through megaphone] Yes, yes, that's right! Put those flabby arms to use! Laugh at your lumbago! Cackle at your cataracts!
[Patrick and the senior citizens try their best, but couldn't due to being old and frail. One old man falls down from the branch and crumbles to dust. SpongeBob sweeps the old man up and revives him by watering him with a watering can.]
Old Man #3: Is it nap time yet?
SpongeBob: Nope! It's time for the dance party! Everybody on board.
[Patrick and the senior citizens sit on the rug and SpongeBob drags them away. The scene changes to dancing arena where SpongeBob attempts to help Patrick and the senior citizens dance.]
SpongeBob: Are you ready to get down?
Patrick and the senior citizens: Yeah. [get down on the floor and fall asleep]
SpongeBob: No, not like that. Like this! [turns on ragtime music]
[Patrick and the senior citizens stand up and dance to the ragtime music.]
Patrick: Now-now-now-now you're talking.

SpongeBob: Now, let's kick it up a hundred notches! [turns on loud dance music] Yeah!

[The loud dance music causes Patrick and the senior citizens to get heart attacks.]
Patrick: Oh, what's happening?
[Patrick and the senior citizens pass out unconscious to the floor.]
SpongeBob: Oh, clear! [zaps the floor with the defibrillator. reviving Patrick and the senior citizens]
[Patrick and the senior citizens laugh and Patrick zaps his head with the defibrillator. The scene changes to SpongeBob dragging Patrick and the senior citizens across the sidewalk.]
SpongeBob: Isn't it great to get outdoors with the fresh air and sunshine?
Old Lady #2: Stop this rug! Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
Patrick and the senior citizens: Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
SpongeBob: Bunny Buns? That's a good idea! Nothing makes people feel young like arcade games, grease, and sugar.
[Inside Bunny Buns, children are riding on kiddie rides, eating pizza, playing arcade games, and swimming in the ball pit. Several kids are watching the animatronic animal stage show. Patrick is whacking the animatronic badger with his cane.]
Patrick: You're coming in too fast on the bridge and you're blowing clams! [whacks the robot's head off and lands on a kid's pizza; the kid cries and Patrick listens through an ear trumpet] Now that's what I call jazz!
SpongeBob: [pushes Patrick away] Ha, ha. So sorry. Let me just take this. [takes the severed robot head and leaves]
[One old man is playing Bunny Bash while using Joshua as the hammer. Joshua's mom grabs her son and drags him away again. An old couple attempts to eat pizza, but they end up pulling their dentures out.]
SpongeBob: I can help you with that. [pull the dentures off the pizza slices and stuffs them back into the old couple's mouths] Eww.
Old Man #1: Hey! [laughs, shakes a soda can and squirts soda at Patrick]
SpongeBob: Old people, behave!
Old Man #1: [gets squirted by Patrick] Whoa! [flies into a skee ball machine and comes out in ticket form] 23 skidoo!
SpongeBob: Oh. [groans as he straightens out the old man]
Patrick: [screams] SpongeBob! [struggles to swim in the ball pit] I'm drowning! [sinks into the ball pit]
SpongeBob: I'm coming, Patrick! [jumps into the ball pit and pulls Patrick out]
[SpongeBob performs CPR and makes him spit out several balls and Joshua. Joshua's mom grabs her son and drags her away again.]
Patrick: Thanks, old-timer.
SpongeBob: Oh, you're welcome. What, who are you calling old-timer? [looks at his reflection on the screen of a video game console and sees himself getting old and wrinkly] Whoa. Where have the years gone? [he and Patrick walk slowly together until he falls flat on the floor] I'm losing steam. [spews out steam from his holes]
Patrick: Wait, hey, man. Don't make a scene in front of all my old friends. [SpongeBob's steam turns Patrick's skin moist and his cane disappears, making him young again] Oh. [looks at his reflection on the screen of a video game console and sees himself young again] Ohh. Now I can't dodder.
[The scene changes back to Shady Shoals and SpongeBob is resting on a rocking chair with a heart monitor next to him. Patrick walks up and puts a blanket onto SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Here you go, old friend. [the heart monitor stops beeping] Huh? [groans in sadness and covers SpongeBob up to his face, thinking he has died]
SpongeBob: [wakes up and feels young again] Gotcha!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: You got me again. [laughs]
[Meanwhile, Clarabelle is playing Marco Polo with several senior citizens near the coral tree.]
Clarabelle: Marco.
Old Man #3: Polo.
Clarabelle: Marco!
Marco: [climbs down the tree] Oh, that's it! I said I was-a gonna clobber the next-a person what-a calls my name!
Clarabelle: No one clobbers Clarabelle! [flexes her flabby arms and her biceps forms into a scooter with rocket boosters on it; then she gives Marco a knuckle sandwich and sends him flying off distance, exploding on impact] Oh, Marco? [takes out an ear trumpet to hear]
Marco: [weakly] Polo.


[The episode begins SpongeBob's, Squidward's and Patrick's houses at dusk.]
Patrick: Batter up!
[SpongeBob rolls in a little stove with pots, pans, a whisk, and a bowl. He pours pancake mix into the bowl and cracks two eggs. He mixes them up and puts the batter on the pan.]
SpongeBob: [flips the pancakes] Ah, oh.
[Patrick throws the pan and SpongeBob swings his own pan to hit it like he was playing baseball.]
Patrick: I got it, I got it! [falls on the ground as the pancakes land on his plate.]
SpongeBob: [sticks out his tongue] Wah! [eats one pancake]
[Patrick slurps down on the pancakes and the two friends give each other a high-five.]
Patrick: Whoo-hoo!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run around Squidward's house while banging on pots and pans. Moments later, an extremely irritated Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Patrick crash into the door, landing in front of Squidward.]
Squidward: What are you two dizzy dingbats doing out here?!
SpongeBob: Just treasuring our time together, Squidward.
Squidward: Well, that time is over! Say good night, go to your separate houses, and be quiet!
[SpongeBob and Patrick whimper and cry.]
Patrick: [cries] I can't do it! I can't be away from my best friend!
SpongeBob: [cries] No, it hurts too much!
[SpongeBob and Patrick continue to cry.]
Squidward: Oh, will you two cut it out?
[SpongeBob and Patrick stop crying.]
SpongeBob: Cut it out... Squidward, that's a great idea!
Squidward and Patrick: It is?
[SpongeBob takes out a pair of scissors, cuts off part of his head and forms it into a tiny version of himself.]
Patrick: Wow! My turn!
[Patrick rips his head off and also forms it into a tiny version of himself. SpongeBob and Patrick hug each as the tiny versions of themselves hug and dance around.]
Squidward: I think I'm gonna be sick! [gets sick and runs back into his house]

Patrick: This is great. See you forever, SpongeBob.

Mini Patrick: [now wearing the teddy bear's clothes] Ah. [SpongeBob puts a hat on Mini Patrick's head and they both laugh] Ah! [jumps into SpongeBob's arms]
[The scene changes to Patrick, Mini SpongeBob, SpongeBob and Mini Patrick sleeping together in their respective houses. The next day, SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab with Mini Patrick wearing a sailor suit.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward.

Mini Patrick: [laughs] Dah, uh-huh.
[SpongeBob takes out a small version of his grill and puts a tiny Krabby Patty on it to cook. Mini Patrick's mouth waters.]
Mini Patrick: Ah.
[SpongeBob fixes up the tiny Krabby Patty for Mini Patrick and serves it to him. Mini Patrick dances gleefully and goes to enjoy his sandwich.]
Mini Patrick: Ahh. Hmm? [sees the bigger Krabby Patties on the grill and whimpers; he throws away the tiny Krabby Patty] Ahhh! Yah! [jumps off the counter and flies over to the grill, but gets slammed in the face by SpongeBob's spatula]
SpongeBob: Huh? Careful there, little buddy. The grill is hot. [puts Mini Patrick back on the counter with his spatula]
Mini Patrick: [gasps as he sees SpongeBob dump French fries into the fryer] Ohhh.
[SpongeBob pushes down the fryer and begins making French fries. Mini Patrick climbs down from the counter, climbs on the fryer and goes to dive in the cooking oil.]
SpongeBob: [struggles to open a pickle jar] Huh?
Mini Patrick: [jumps real high] Whee-ah! [lands in SpongeBob's hat]
SpongeBob: Stop! [squeezes Mini Patrick out of his hat] Bad, Tiny Patrick! Hmm. [takes out rope and ties Mini Patrick with it] Sorry to do this, little guy, but I have to keep you safe while I get some work done. [ties the rope around his waist and puts Mini Patrick in his pocket; then he goes back to flipping patties on the grill] Ah-yah.
[Mini Patrick pulls himself out of SpongeBob's pocket and swings himself into the side of the grill. crashing into it. Mini Patrick whimpers. Meanwhile, back at Patrick's house, Patrick and Mini SpongeBob are still sleeping. The sand clock rings 12:00 and Patrick bangs on it to stop. Patrick and Mini SpongeBob stretch and yawn.]

Patrick: [makes a weird face] Eeh. [gets nervous] Hmm. Hmm.
[SpongeBob becomes more nervous and couldn't figure out what to say. The sand sofa crumbles. Mini SpongeBob pops out of the sand pile, gasping tp breathe.]
SpongeBob: So, uh, I'd love to hang out, but I already have some plans with Tiny Patrick here.
Patrick: Oh, yeah, well, me and Tiny SpongeBob, [picks up Mini SpongeBob] we're pretty busy tonight, so good night.
SpongeBob: Good night.
[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick cry out for each other. It seems as though that SpongeBob and Patrick are unintentionally preventing their miniature selves from seeing each other. The scene changes to Mini Patrick now dressed in some baby pajamas with a zipper. He is growing tired of SpongeBob's pampering.]
SpongeBob: I don't want you getting into trouble during the night, so you're gonna stay in the aquarium like a good little sleepy clam. [drops Mini Patrick in the aquarium]
Mini Patrick: Ahh! [tries to climb out, but SpongeBob puts a pile of books on top of the aquarium. SpongeBob goes to sleep as Mini Patrick knocks on the aquarium. The scene changes to Mini SpongeBob trying to open a jar of seanut butter, but couldn't because he only has one arm.]

[Mini Patrick attempts lift the remote, but couldn't because it was too big and heavy.]

[Mini SpongeBob attempts to flip the egg, but ends up sending himself and the egg flying into the television.]
SpongeBob: Our world is just too big for them. Ohh, I have an idea. [slithers himself free]
Patrick: Oh, I hope it's not another one of your crazy plans to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.

Patrick: [realizing his error]Oh, yeah!
[SpongeBob frees Patrick and they run off. SpongeBob grabs a toolbox. Patrick grabs paint cans. SpongeBob grabs a bowl of fruit. They both run outside and prepare to build something. Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick follow them outside.]

The next day, a small sand castle version of Squidward's house is shown. Squidward's eyes open in the sand.]
Squidward: [wakes up] Ah, too bright. [hears chattering] Oh, those two again!
[Squidward shakes the sand off. It appears that Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick snuck into Squidward's house, took Squidward and buried him up to his head in the sand right in between their houses. Just then, Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick run around Squidward, banging pots and pans really loud.]
Squidward: What the—
[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick continue to bang on pots and pans like the actual SpongeBob and Patrick did early in the episode. Mini Patrick throws a pot and Mini SpongeBob hits it like a baseball, hitting Squidward in the nose.]

[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick gasp, jump onto Squidward's nose, and hug his nose as an apology.]

Karen: [relaxing in the tub with mud as Plankton massages her wheels] Oh, Sheldon. You're so romantic.
Plankton: It's all about you today, Karen.
Karen: Oh, this makes up of a lot of your stupidity lately, Plankton.
Plankton: [dressed in a handsome outfit] Plankton's stepped away for a moment. The name's Ray Ray, and I am at your service, m'lady. [spins Karen's wheel] Pow!
Karen: [wipes the cucumbers and lotion off the screen and shows lips puckering up] Oh, kiss me, pipsqueak. I mean, Ray Ray.
[Plankton and Karen are about to share a kiss. When suddenly, the screen turns off and turns on to show Plankton's grandmother, Lily Plankton.]
Plankton: [sees his grandmother on Karen's screen] Grandma?! I told you never to call me on this screen.
Lily Plankton: Sheldon, [lifts her glasses] is that you?
Plankton: [takes off his suit] Yes, it's me, Grandma. Always nice to hear from you. Okay, gotta go. [pushes Karen]
Lily Plankton: Okay, sweetie. See you tomorrow at 8 AM sharp.
Plankton: Right, see you then. Wait a minute, what? 8 AM? Um, what's happening at 8 AM, Grandma?
Lily Plankton: Don't you remember, silly?  You promised me you'd own [holds up a picture of the Krusty Krab] the Krusty Krab by my 90th birthday. Well, my 90th is tomorrow! You do own the Krusty Krab now, right?
[Plankton gets a bit nervous. But inside his brain, a tiny version of himself blows up a mountain to form the word, "lie."]
Plankton: Lie, that's it! [zooms back to Plankton] Uh, you're darn right I own the Krusty Krab, Grandma, and I can't wait to give you the grand tour, uh, tomorrow morning.
Lily Plankton: Aww, see you then.
Karen: [turns off screen and smacks Plankton] That smack was for Plankton. [shows Ray Ray on the screen] Now bring back Ray Ray. [puckers up]
Plankton: Oh, what am I gonna do, Karen? How am I gonna fool Grandma tomorrow?
Karen: Oh, okay, I guess bath time is over. [steps out of the bath tub and wraps a towel around] Why don't you and Ray Ray take a long walk off a short plank?
[Karen turns her screen and kicks Plankton out with a boot. Plankton flies out of the Chum Bucket and lands onto the ground.]
Plankton: [gets up] Gotta think, gotta think. [pulls out his brain attached to his antennas] Come on, brain! [smacks it, beats it up, and swallows it back in his head through his eye]
SpongeBob: [holding an arrow] This way to the Krusty Krab! Pull right in and order a Krabby Patty! [flips the arrow around and around; he throws it in the air] Whoo! [he bounces the arrow on his butt] Whoop, whoop. [flips it over] Ooh. [spins it with his tongue] Aah. [he throws it in the air, making it fly up to the surface and it goes back down again; SpongeBob continues to play with the arrow until he gets tired] Whew. '[throws it up again, but it falls on his head] Ow! [gets up and struggles to pull it out]
Plankton: SpongeBoob, you gotta help me.
SpongeBob: [pulls the arrow out] Sorry, Plankton, what can I do to help you?
[The arrow falls on top of Plankton.]
Plankton: [gets up with the arrow] This is not an evil scheme. [uses the arrow to explain his dilemma to SpongeBob] The truth is I promised my grandma I would own the Krusty Krab by her 90th birthday. So, I need Krabs to play pretend tomorrow and fool my grandma into believing I'm the new owner, otherwise she will think I'm a big loser. Got it? [throws away the arrow]
SpongeBob: [his face spins after Plankton finishes, but stops it on time] Well, I believe you, Plankton, but I'm not sure Mr. Krabs is gonna buy it.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not gonna buy what?
French Narrator: One Pathetic Sob-Story Later...
Mr. Krabs: I ain't buying it! This whole grandma thing sounds just like another phony plot to steal me formula.
Plankton: I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to this, Eugene, but... [rips his body open to reveal his sweet, innocent self inside; his innocent side whimpers with his eye wide open]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] SpongeBob, there's something wrong with his eye.
SpongeBob: That's Plankton's rarely seen sincere face, Mr. Krabs, and it means for once he is telling the truth.
Mr. Krabs: [teary eyed] You know, [shows a tattoo of his grandmother on his chest] I have a grandma too.
SpongeBob: Aww.
Mr. Krabs: [sobs] All right, I buy it. [SpongeBob gasps]
Plankton: Thank you.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs opening the safe in the office.]
Mr. Krabs: First things first. [takes the formula and swallows it; he closes the safe] That should keep it safe for six to eight hours. [speaks through megaphone] All right, me pretties, let's make this place pro-Plankton pronto! [flicks Plankton]
[SpongeBob kicks Mr. Krabs' desk and replaces it with a smaller desk for Plankton. Plankton puts the name plate with the word, "Owner" on his desk.

Plankton: Hi, Grandma. Happy birthday.
Karen: Nice to see you again, Grandma Plankton.
Lily Plankton: [lifts her glasses] Ugh. Who invited C-Pee-Eww? [laughs]
Karen: [feels rejected] All right, I tried. [she leaves angrily, running Plankton over]
Plankton: Owuh! [unsticks his squished body from the road] Let me help you with your bag, Grandma. [gets smacked in the face by Lily's purse] Ouch!
[Plankton escorts his grandmother into the restaurant.]
Plankton: Well, here we are, Grandma. Welcome to the Krusty Plankton. I named it after you.
Lily Plankton: [pinches Plankton's cheek] Oh, well, aren't you a sweet grandson? [sees SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs] Who are they?
Plankton: They're just my employees, Grandma. Meet SpongeBob and Eugene.
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Hello, Grandma Plankton.
Lily Plankton: They look like very nice boys, and I'll bet they're even nicer when they're working.
Plankton: You heard, Grandma! We ain't running a welcome wagon here! Get back to work!
[SpongeBob runs back and forth until he jumps back into the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Yeah, sure thing, Plankton.
[Mr. Krabs laughs until Plankton pushes a bucket of cleaning supplies onto Mr. Krabs, making him fall flat on his face on the floor.]
Plankton: [pokes Mr. Krabs' eye] That's Mr. Plankton to you, busboy.
Mr. Krabs: [sarcastically] Sorry, Mr. Plankton. It won't happen again. [pushes himself away]

Squidward: [gets up] Okay, who's the wise guy?
Lily Plankton: [becomes head-over-heels with Squidward] Ohh. [sees a vision of Squidward being a very handsome man] Oh, my goodness! Who is this handsome young man?
Plankton: Oh, that's Squidward. He's nobody. Moving along...
Lily Plankton: [jumps on Squidward's nose] Mm. Squidward. Didn't we meet at an early bird dinner?
SpongeBob: Ooh, I think someone has a not-so-secret admirer! [laughs until Lily whacks him with her purse] Ow! [flies back into the kitchen]
Squidward: [takes Lily off his nose] All right, lady, I don't normally say this, [drops Lily on the table] but get off my nose.
Plankton: [quietly] Go along with it, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: [quietly] Or you're fired.
Squidward: [sighs and puts Lily back on his nose] So, Grandma Plankton, where have you been all my life?
Lily Plankton: [chuckles] Call me Lily. [kisses Squidward]
Plankton: Okay, Grandma, you're embarrassing me now.
Lily Plankton: [hops onto Squidward's head] To the kitchen, Squidward.

Lily Plankton: [takes out her false teeth] I'll need my teeth for this. [drops them] Whoops. [her teeth drops onto the grill and it melts] Oops. I dropped my choppers. Oh, well. I guess Squidward will have to chew it for me.
Squidward: Oh, sure, I'll—what?! [Mr. Krabs opens Squidward's mouth] Aah.
[SpongeBob throws the patty in Squidward's mouth and Mr. Krabs forces him to chew it.]
Lily Plankton: [chuckles] That's it, chew it up real good. That's enough. My turn.
[Mr. Krabs forces Squidward to stick out his tongue.]
Squidward: Aah.
[Plankton pushes Squidward's tongue upwards and feeds his grandmother the chewed up patty.]
Lily Plankton: Aah. [eats it up and swallows it] Delicious.
SpongeBob, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton: [disgusted] Ew!
Lily Plankton: Oh, Sheldon, you've outdone yourself. You really are a master chef.
[Mr. Krabs grumbles and knaws on his claw in anger. The scene changes to Lily getting ready to leave.]
Lily Plankton: Thank you, Sheldon. [pinches Plankton's cheek] You've really made my birthday something extra special this year.
Plankton: All right, Grandma. [gives his grandmother her purse and she heads out the door] Got your bag? You are out the door and that is that.
Lily Plankton: [comes back in] Oh, just one more thing.
[SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward groan.]
Lily Plankton: My last birthday wish is to get a photo of me posing with the Krabby Patty secret formula.
[Plankton makes that sweet, innocent face again.]
Plankton: [whimpers] Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Fine. Anything to get that bag with the bag out of here. [pulls off his head, digs in his body and gives Plankton and his grandmother the formula; Plankton groans as the formula crushes him]
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward: [holding cameras] Say cheese.
Plankton and Lily Plankton: Cheese.
[Suddenly, Lily's purse turns into rocket boasters and flies away with Plankton and the formula.]
Lily Plankton: Ahhh!
[SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward scream.]
Lily Plankton: [laughs] Finally, the secret formula is mine!
Mr. Krabs: I knew your sincerity was insincere, sir!
Plankton: I didn't know anything about this, Eugene, honest! But I love it! Now we can rule the world as a family, eh, Grandma?
Lily Plankton: [laughs maniacally with Plankton] Sorry, Sheldon, but I'm not sharing the formula with you! [kicks Plankton off]
Plankton: [falls] But Grandma! [falls on a packet of ketchup]
Lily Plankton: Adios, mi amour! Mmmm. [blows a kiss onto Squidward, causing him to fall over]
[Lily laughs maniacally as she leaves the restaurant through the roof.]
Plankton: Why? Why did I lie? [pulls his antennas off his head]
SpongeBob: Why? Why did I pretend? [twists his body]
Mr. Krabs: Why? [opens his empty chest] Why did I give her my formula?
Squidward: [speaking on the phone] Why? Why wouldn't we be open on Tuesday? Idiot! [hangs up the phone and pouts]
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton: What have we done?
[Lily Plankton flies over to Shady Shoals Rest Home with the secret formula and sits on her chair with it.]
Lily Plankton: I have the secret formula! [laughs] This world is mine!
[Lily daydreams about being an evil, tyrannical overlord with Squidward as her husband. They are sitting on top of the Krusty Krab, now Granny Plankton's Krabby Patties. Below the restaurant, SpongeBob, Plankton, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Sandy and everyone in Bikini Bottom grovel over her as if she is their lord and mistress.]
Everyone: [chanting] Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!
Lily Plankton: [chuckles] Darling, [pokes Squidward on the head with her staff] why don't you toss the peasants a little something?
[Squidward throws a patty down to them. Everyone goes for the patty and starts fighting over it.]
Fred: My leg!
[Lily laughs maniacally, but falls asleep. As she sleeps, everything goes back into reality. Unknown to her, Plankton, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are watching her sleep.]
Mr. Krabs: [takes the formula and replaces it with prune juice] I'll take that, thank you very much. [swallows the formula] Safe and sound.
Plankton: [covers his grandmother with a blanket] Happy birthday, Grandma. [kisses her as she whacks him with her purse, knocking out several of his teeth]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down the path with an orange balloon. They take a deep breath and hold it until they reach Sandy's treedome. They enter the dome, put on their water helmets, and spit out water for them to breathe. Sandy is welding some contraptions together for her latest invention. SpongeBob taps her shoulder.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy!
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Check out our new balloon.
Patrick: Her name is Squeaky. [rubs the balloon and squeaks]
Sandy: Sorry, guys, I'm working on my new invention. Y'all better come back tomorrow.
Both: [exclaim] New invention?!
Sandy: See?
[Sandy shows them her new invention as her wheel turns making a colorful vortex.]
Both: Ooh.
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: It's a portal to other worlds. I built it to explore the universe. Also for quick trips to Texas to pick up some of my favorite barbecued nuts. [puts her hand through the portal and takes a bag of nuts from a sleeping old man] Yoink!
Old coot: Huh? Dagnabbit! That ding-dang, nut-stealing arm is back again!
[Sandy pulls her arm back from the portal with a bag of nuts and eats some.]
Sandy: Pretty nifty, huh?
SpongeBob: [looking at the control panel with Patrick] Yeah. Nifty. Ooh, what's this do? [pulls on levers] Vroom, vroom, vroom! [screeches and presses some buttons and a rope]
[Patrick makes beeping sounds as he pushes several buttons. Both SpongeBob and Patrick laugh and continue playing on the control panel.]
Sandy: Hold it, don't touch anything. I gotta go grab some 1/16 inch diodes to finish the weld. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you heard Sandy. [presses buttons as he talks] We shouldn't touch this, or this, or this, or this, or this, or this! [pushes buttons with his feet and toes]
Patrick: Definitely don't do this, SpongeBob. [pushes a lever and pulls another; pushes several buttons with his buttocks] Or..or this! [presses more buttons with his buttocks]
SpongeBob: And under no circumstances should you ever touch this. [pushes red button] Boink.
[Suddenly, the alarm goes off and the button activates the vortex.]
Both: Whoa. [stammering]
Sandy: [comes out of her tree and gasps] Oh, no! You've activated the vortex!
SpongeBob: Ooh, so swirly.
Patrick: Look at all the colors.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are completely hypnotized by the vortex's swirling colors and begin to walk closer to it like zombies.]
Sandy: Whatever you do, don't walk into it!
Patrick: Can we skip into it?
[SpongeBob and Patrick skip up to the vortex.]
Sandy: SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Star, you stop right now! [SpongeBob and Patrick stop] Now turn around. [SpongeBob and Patrick turn around] Now walk.
[SpongeBob and Patrick lift their right legs and instead of walking over to Sandy, they walk backwards into the vortex. The vortex closes.]
Sandy: [gasps] Oh. [groans] Those two ain't no smarter than a circus peanut.
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream as they fly through the swirling vortex. They travel to several different universes until finally, they fall through the vortex ending up in a blank, white dimension.]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Patrick: Whoa!
SpongeBob: Oh, oh! [crashes to the ground and Patrick falls on top of him]
Patrick: Goodness. [comes out of SpongeBob's body] Mm, mmm.
SpongeBob: [looks around] Wow. We've entered a whole new dimension. Uh, a blank, white, empty one.
Patrick: Must be the boring dimension. Let's go home.
SpongeBob: Maybe there's an exit this way. [walks to the left, but ends up going back to Patrick] Huh, hmm, must've made a wrong turn. [walks to the right, but ends up going back to Patrick again] Huh? [sprints around and around, but no matter how he walks in the strange dimension, he always ends up in the same area] Patrick, there's no escape! There's no escape, Patrick!
Patrick: [sobs] I can't take it! Let me out of here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick frantically run up, down, left, right, and loop-de-loop in many attempts to escape. But their efforts were no avail. SpongeBob screeches lines across the floor as he bumps into Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick take notice of the lines moving.]
Both: Hmm. Huh? [the lines crawl away] Ooh!
[SpongeBob draws another line and it crawls away.]
SpongeBob: Mm...[laughs] Oh, Patrick, watch this! [sticks his hand in his head] Boink. [pulls out a giant pencil that looked almost like the magic pencil from Frankendoodle. He draws a boatmobile above them. The boat revs up its engine and runs over Patrick, leaving him tire marks on his face.]
SpongeBob: Whoops, sorry!
Patrick: [gets up] Heh, draw some more!
[SpongeBob draws a door similar to his front door of his house. He opens the door and reveals a living similar to the one at his house.]
SpongeBob: Nice décor. [closes the door] Hmm. [draws a doodle version of his house]
[SpongeBob then draws a doodle version of Squidward's house and Patrick's house.]
Patrick: Oh, my house! [jumps and hugs his doodle house until suddenly, all three houses are being lifted in the air] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah! Hey!
SpongeBob: Oops, forgot to draw the ground.
[SpongeBob draws a horizontal line for the ground. The three doodle houses drop back down, crushing Patrick under one. Patrick pulls himself out and his stomach rumbles.]
Patrick: Ahh.
Patrick's tum-tum: I'm starving.
SpongeBob: No problem. [draws the Krusty Krab work hat] Two patties coming right up! [draws a doodle Krabby Patty] Your doodle patty, sir. [draws himself a doodle Krabby Patty]
[They both eat the doodle patties, however, they tasted horrible.]
Patrick: [spits it out] Tastes weird.
SpongeBob: Yeah, they are a little dry. [his doodle patty and doodle hat crumble to dust]
Patrick: I miss real Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob: I miss Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: I miss Sandy.
SpongeBob: I miss Gary.
Both: I miss Squidward!
Patrick: You know who I miss most of all? [takes the pencil and draws a mini version of DoodleBob] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: But Patrick, I'm right here.
[DoodleBob babbles.]
SpongeBob: Aww, isn't he cute?
Patrick: How do you do?
[DoodleBob babbles and jumps onto Patrick. Patrick hugs DoodleBob.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I'm next on the hug list.
[DoodleBob disappears.]
Patrick: Oh, oh! He disappeared! [reappears in Patrick's belly] Oh, why was a cursed with the hug of death? Why?!
SpongeBob: He's not gone, Patrick. He's right there on your tum-tum.
[DoodleBob multiplies into numerous mini DoodleBobs.]
Doodle Clones: You doodle!
[The Doodle clones all scramble on Patrick's belly while babbling, which at first results in tickling him. Then, without warning, they all start biting him like mosquitoes.]
Patrick: Get 'em off! Get 'em off me, SpongeBob! [the mini DoodleBobs continue biting him]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick! [draws a hose and sprays water on Patrick to wash the DoodleBobs off; leaving him a hole in his stomach]
Patrick: Oh, thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob: You're welcome. [gets up] I guess we need to be more careful.
[DoodleBob comes back to life in the puddle and comes out in a much taller form. He takes the pencil and draws two angry eyebrows on his face. He quickly turns over to SpongeBob and Patrick with the pencil, scaring them out of their wits. DoodleBob babbles.]
SpongeBob: Nice DoodleBob. Put the pencil down.
[DoodleBob draws an anvil and it falls on top of SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Patrick: Oh, run!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run away from DoodleBob. DoodleBob draws a tank over them. SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. DoodleBob draws a piano and SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. DoodleBob draws a safe and SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. SpongeBob and Patrick continue to run with DoodleBob in hot pursuit.]
Patrick: What are we gonna do, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [takes off his left shoe and sharpens it into a pencil point] We'll have to fight doodle with doodle. [draws three doodle versions of Mr. Krabs, Gary, and Squidward] Hold it right there. You're no match for my doodle squad! [Doodle Squidward, Doodle Gary, and Doodle Mr. Krabs come to life] Attack!
[The three doodles run over to fight DoodleBob. But DoodleBob grabs Doodle Squidward and whacks Doodle Mr. Krabs and Doodle Gary. Then he draws angry eyebrows and mustaches on all three of them, making them evil. All three doodles turn against SpongeBob and Patrick and go to attack them.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, run! [Doodle Gary jumps on SpongeBob]
Patrick: Ooh! [Doodle Mr. Krabs pinches Patrick with his claws]
[Doodle Squidward kicks SpongeBob and Patrick in the faces. All three doodles run away and DoodleBob babbles.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm going in. [gives Patrick his shoe] Cover me. [pulls up his pants and runs over to DoodleBob]
Patrick: [draws a blanket] I gotcha, buddy! [puts to blanket over SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Huh? Whoa! [bumps into his doodle house and pulls over the blanket] What? Hey, where'd DoodleBob go?
Patrick: [being held by DoodleBob] Over here.
SpongeBob: Yipe! You let him go, Doodle!
[DoodleBob draws rope around Patrick. He babbles as he looms the pencil over SpongeBob, the tip near inches from his face. Then he draws a grave and a tombstone. He draws a coffin around SpongeBob and pushes him into the grave, burying him. DoodleBob drags Patrick and runs away with him. SpongeBob pops out from the grave.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
[SpongeBob draws a telescope and sees DoodleBob in his drawn castle tying his prisoner, Patrick, to a flagpole.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick! I'm coming for you! [runs over to DoodleBob's castle]
Patrick: [From the distance] Good to know!
SpongeBob: Surrender peacefully, DoodleBob, or face the wrath of...[draws his armor suit] SpongeBob, Knight of the Square Table! [jumps off his armor suit] Charge!
[DoodleBob launches flaming boulders with his catapult. SpongeBob dodges one.]
SpongeBob: Ha-ha! [a larger boulder crushes him]
[DoodleBob laughs. SpongeBob draws a door on the boulder and comes out unharmed.]
SpongeBob: Release my friend before I get really tough! [buffs up until his pecs get flabby]
[DoodleBob laughs and launches Patrick with the catapult.]
SpongeBob: [screams] I gotcha! I gotcha!
[Patrick crashes into SpongeBob.]
Both: Oof!
[DoodleBob then draws stamper and creates a whole army of DoodleBobs. They run out from the castle to attack SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run.]
Patrick: What are we gonna do?
SpongeBob: [takes off his shoe and draws a line] In here.
[SpongeBob and Patrick hide as DoodleBob and his army run past them. SpongeBob and Patrick come out.]
SpongeBob: Phew.
Patrick: [loudly] Nah-nah, you missed us! [through megaphone] Now you gotta kiss us!
[Patrick's idiotic outburst attracted DoodleBob's attention and commands his army to go back.]
Patrick: Nah-nah...
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: What? [gasps and realizes his mistake]
[DoodleBob babbles as SpongeBob and Patrick cry and hug each other.]
SpongeBob: Oh, we'll never get back home!
Patrick: We'll never see our balloon Squeaky again!
SpongeBob: Oh, Squeaky! [gasps] Squeaky! [takes off his show and draws a balloon] Grab on, buddy!
[SpongeBob and Patrick grab onto the balloon's string and they float away. DoodleBob attempts to grab them.]
SpongeBob: Too slow, DoodleBob!
[DoodleBob babbles.]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob.
[DoodleBob commands his army to connect with each other to make him high enough to reach SpongeBob and Patrick. Once they reach them, DoodleBob grabs the balloon's string. SpongeBob takes off his shoe and draws some scissors.]
SpongeBob: Here, Patrick!
Patrick: [grabs the scissors] Oh, ooh, uh... snip! [cuts the string and he and SpongeBob fall down]
[DoodleBob and his army float far away with the balloon until they are out of sight.]
SpongeBob: Well, that's the end of DoodleBob.
Patrick: But we're still stuck here.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Too bad Sandy isn't here. She'd find a way to get us back home. [gets an idea] Wait a minute, Patrick! [takes off his shoe and draws a doodle version of Sandy] Doodle us home, Sandy.
[Doodle Sandy takes SpongeBob's shoe and draws a vortex.]
Doodle Sandy: Bleeble blobble blortex!
Both: Yay! Thanks, Sandy!
Patrick: Whoo!
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter Doodle Sandy's vortex. Meanwhile, back at Sandy's treedome, Sandy is struggling to figure out a way to enter the vortex to retrieve SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sandy: Hmm, mm-hmm... [the vortex reactivates] What the—?
[SpongeBob and Patrick return home through the vortex, much to Sandy's shocking surprise.]
SpongeBob: Sandy, we're back!
[SpongeBob and Patrick dry up. They take deep breathes and put their water helmets on.]
Sandy: I ain't fixed the vortex yet! How in tarnation did you get back?
SpongeBob: Sandy saved us. [he and Patrick leave]
Sandy: [confused] What? [the old man's hand appears through the vortex and taps Sandy's shoulder] Huh? Huh?
Old coot: Give me back my nuts!
[Sandy gulps nervously. The screen turns black. DoodleBob appears and writes "The End" on the screen, ending the episode.]


Narrator: Snark Chat with Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: And we're back. My first guest had dinner with me just last night. He's a close personal friend of mine. Please welcome the Krabby Patty. [audience clap] Great to have you back on the program.
Krabby Patty: Great to be here, BB.
Bubble Bass: Well, I'm sorry to say it, but last night, you were not quite as delicious as one would hope.
Krabby Patty: Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Mr. Krabs will give you a refund. [percussion sting] [laughter]
Mama Bass: Bubble Bass, who are you talking to down there?
Bubble Bass: Mother! Please stop trying to undermine my fantasy talk show! [Krabby Patty thuds] Mmph.
Mama Bass: You march yourself upstairs this instant! Take out the garbage, dry the dishes, and walk the worm!
Bubble Bass: Ooh, I don't feel like it!  Huh? [Mama Bass throws garbage, two dishes, and the worm at Bubble Bass] That tears it, Mother! [grunts] I am moving out! [slams the front door]
Mama Bass: Moving? Hah! You can't even do your own laundry! [grunts]
Bubble Bass: [underwear lands on Bubble Bass's face, and a fly is heard buzzing. SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing in the background] All I need to do is find two able-bodied idiots. But where am I to find such stupidity on such short notice? Hm... [wagoon crashes into Bubble Bass]
SpongeBob: Whoops. [Bubble Bass grunts] Sorry, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: Why you two able-bodied idiots! I—  [gasps and giving an evil grin] Ooh. [Patrick sobbers and SpongeBob blinks strangely] Why, SpongeBob and Patrick, my occasional friends. How would you two like to earn a free lunch?
Patrick: Freeeeeee lunch! [His head turns as if a balloon and then explodes]'
Bubble Bass:  All righty, we're moving all of my belongings out of my mother's basement into my grandmother's basement across town. Let's start with my lounge.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, up with the loveseat. [grunts]
Bubble Bass: [fakes having his back popped by breaking a stick] Ow! My bad back! I guess you two will have to move everything without me. So I'll meet you both at this address.
SpongeBob: But don't you have to pack your things before we can move 'em?
Bubble Bass: Ooh, ahh, I guess you'll have to pack my stuff too. But remember with gastric prizes await your mouths.
SpongeBob: [beat horn blares from ship]  Oh, Patrick [puts a finger inside Patrick's mouth, causing him to fill up and release water]
Bubble Bass: [laughs]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get p-p-p-packing!
Patrick: [grumbles trying to fit a stool into the box, breaking the stool in the process] [hums]
SpongeBob: Oh... [grunts] [puts on welder's helmet and turns on torch] [hums] [laughs]
SpongeBob: [pushes computers in the box grunting]
Patrick: [grunts] [water from toilet splashes] [toilet shatters]
SpongeBob: [grunts]
Both: [both grunt trying to push wooden planks]
Patrick: [hits mail-box with an ax, causing clanging]
SpongeBob: [exclaims] [spits out mail]
Patrick: [gasps]
SpongeBob: [grunts]
Patrick: All right, that's the last of it.
SpongeBob: Whew, I hope we didn't leave anything behind.
Patrick: [grunts] [part of the house clangs]
Kids: [laughs]
SpongeBob: [grunts]
Old Man Jenkins: [screams]
Both: [grunts]
SpongeBob: Oh pardon us, ma'am, but could you walk around?
Ms. Mildred: Walk around? Hmph, I'm Lady Upturn the 333rd, and you want me to walk around? [laughs] I'm afraid you just have to back it up.
SpongeBob: Back it up? [backup alarm blares] Okay. Back it up, Patrick.
Patrick: What'd you say?
SpongeBob: [grunts] Oh, oh, oh!
Patrick: [grunts] [giggles afterward]
SpongeBob: [pants] [screams]
Ms. Mildred: [screams] [grunts]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): [exclaims]
Ms. Mildred: Oh! [spits shoe out]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): [both exclaim] [cars vroom, scratching their behind] Huh? [embarrassed shock]
SpongeBob: Phew, hey, Patrick, from now on, we gotta be more careful. Huh? Patrick...
Patrick: [giggles, thinking about the free lunch] [SpongeBob blows the thought away] [exclaims]
SpongeBob: Oh, focus, Patrick, focus!
Patrick: Okay. [grunts "focusing"]
SpongeBob: Ah, that's perfect. [grunts] [laughs] [grunts again]
Patrick: [giggles] [starts grunting]
Both: Hmm? [screams]
Snail: [meows after being stuck on the bag]
Old Man Jenkins: [mumbles] I can walk! [turns around] Oh!
'Kids: [laughs] [Ryan screams, along with SpongeBob and Patrick] [bag comes back to get the other two] Oh!
Old Man Jenkins: [exclaims briefly]
Babies: [laughter]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): Babies?!
SpongeBob: [grunts] [motor revs]
Both: [screams] [tires screech]
Babies: [babbles]
Bag: [thuds on SpongeBob and Patrick]
Random People: [scream]
Patrick: [grunts] SpongeBob? Where are you?
SpongeBob: [grunts] I'm down here. [giggles]
Patrick: [giggles] Shall we, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: We shall, Patrick
Both: [both hum]
Babies: [laughter]
Both: Babies? No! [screams]
Babies: [laughter]
Both: Whoa! [both grunt]
SpongeBob: Hmm...Hm? [turns paper around] Hey, this is the address! We made it, Patrick! Nice aim, babies!
Patrick: Hooray! Now, where's that free lunch? [slurps] [thinks again about it]
SpongeBob: [groans] [slaps Patrick] Focus! Let's get all this stuff inside the house, then we can eat. Hmm, hmm.
Patrick: Hmm, hmm.
Both: [both hum]
SpongeBob: Oh, Bubble Bass, special delivery. [shocked] Hmm? Okay, Patrick, push it!
Both: [both grunt] [bag thuds]
Patrick: [goes through the back door to pull it] [becomes muscular] [destroys the house] And that's how you do it.
SpongeBob: [frightened] Uh-oh, Patrick. Look what we did to Bubble Bass's granny's house.
Fruit man: This wasn't Bubble Bass's grandmother's house. That is! [points to Bubble Bass's grandmother's house] This was my house!
SpongeBob: Well, that's a relief. For a minute there, I thought we did something wrong.
Both: Whew.
Fruit man: [blows up and hat flies down]
Both: [both grunt]
SpongeBob: [looks down] Don't look down, Patrick!
Patrick: [zips eyes] I turned off my eyes. [wind gusting]
SpongeBob: [whimpers] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh! [hiccups] Uh-oh, Patrick, I think I have the—  [hiccups again] Hiccups.
Patrick: Hiccups? I want some. I'm so hungry!
SpongeBob: [hiccups again, exclaims] Here comes another one, Patrick.
Patrick: [blocks SpongeBob's hiccup, grunting]
SpongeBob: Thanks, buddy. We're almost there. Just a few more steps, and we'll claim that free lunch.
Patrick: Yeah—  [hiccups saying "Hiccup!"]
Both: [bridge collapses, both grunt]
SpongeBob: Well, this is a dilly of a pickle.
Babies: [laughter]
Ms. Mildred: Back it up!
Both: [both scream]
Ms. Mildred: Back it up! [x2]
Babies: [laughter]
Ms. Mildred: [hits Patrick in the head with a shoe]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): [both scream] Oof, ta-da, Oof.
Bubble Bass: I hope you didn't damage my goods.
SpongeBob: Oh, your goods are all good, Bubble Bass. And we sure build up an appetite for that free lunch.
Patrick: [gulps out a bib and fork and knife]
Bubble Bass: Oh, yes, about that. I'm afraid I was waiting for you so long that I ate them! [eats the paper bags] Mmm. [belches]
SpongeBob: [whimpers]
Patrick: [inhales and swallows the fork, knife, and bib. grumbles] If my friend SpongeBob doesn't get his free lunch, [a realistic close-up of Patrick's face] things are gonna get crazy! [pants while Bubble Bass melts]
SpongeBob: That was the meanest thing I ever saw, Bubble Bass. You, sir, have crossed the line of aquatic decency. You might think you took a couple of bottom feeders like us for a ride today, but I got a newsflash for you, slappy. These bottom-feeders wouldn't eat your free lunch if you paid us.
Patrick: I would.
SpongeBob: Come, Patrick. I'll make you a free Krabby Patty for $2.50 plus tax.
Bubble Bass: [watches the pair leave and laughs] Well, you pulled it off, Bubble Bass. And you didn't even have to flick a fin. [hums and opens a box]
Mama Bass: [emerges from a box and growls] Bubble Bass, why do you think it's funny to pack your mother in a box and drag her all over town?!
Bubble Bass: [Shocked] Mother?! [grunts as she picks him up and stuffs him in two boxes]
Mama Bass: [Pulls a dolly out her hair] We'll just see how you like it! [pants as she pushes him]
Bubble Bass: I didn't do it! [Mama bass bumps into a mailbox] Ow! [bumps him into a building] Mother, please—  [grunts] It was SpongeBob and Patrick! [grunts] I'll dry the dishes, Mommy. [grunts] I love you, Mommy.


[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where a large crowd of people is gathered to watch SpongeBob perform his latest stunt: To become the first sponge to high dive up to the surface.]
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here for Bikini Bottom News. Today, SpongeBob SquarePants will attempt the impossible: a high-sea dive from that diving board! [points to the diving board on the side of SpongeBob's house] He'll be the first sponge ever to dive up through the ocean.
[Inside the house, Gary is spreading lard all over SpongeBob's body.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Did you hear what Perch said, Gary? The first sponge!
[SpongeBob imagines a statue of himself being built in his honor. Monroe Timmy walks up and stares in awe at the statue.]
Monroe Timmy: Whoa.
SpongeBob Statue: [comes to life] Pretty cool, huh, kid? [winks]
[Monroe Timmy screams and runs away. The daydream ends. SpongeBob sucks the little buoy in his lard-covered body.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, that's enough lard. I gotta warm up.
[SpongeBob slides over to the barbells. He goes to lift it up, but his arms keep slipping off. He ties his arms on the barbell and proceeds to lift it up. The weight of the barbell causes SpongeBob to fall over and it falls off his arms. The barbell is sent flying and crashing through the wall.]
SpongeBob: That's good. I'm all warmed up.
[Mr. Krabs is outside selling SpongeBob-themed products.]
Mr. Krabs: Get your SpongeBob standees here! Buy one and take home a hero! [holds a standee up for Nat Peterson] Here you are, [hits Nat with the standee] here! [hits him again] Here!
Patrick: [walks up and sees a standee of SpongeBob, which he stupidly mistakes for SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob. What's new? [silence; Patrick gets mad] Oh, so that's how it is, huh? The silent treatment. Well, two can play at that game, mister! [huffs and pouts]
Bubble Bass: [Walks up]Excuse me. How much for this stupid starfish standee?
Mr. Krabs: [appears and sees Patrick]Hmm? Hmm. [giggles and makes a greedy face, seeing a perfect chance at more profit] 20 bucks?
Bubble Bass: [grunts as he pulls Patrick's left arm off] But it's damaged.
Mr. Krabs: 10 bucks? [giggles]
Bubble Bass: [holds up money] Sold!
[Bubble Bass gives Mr. Krabs the money. Mr. Krabs' eyelids eats the money and he burps out a receipt from his mouth. The crowd continues to chatter as they wait for SpongeBob to perform his stunt.]
SpongeBob: [pops out from the window] Hi-uh! [sticks himself on the diving board, but he's upside down; he pulls out his little buoy from his head]
Perch Perkins: And here's our hero now with the flag he will plant on the surface.
[The crowd cheers.]
SpongeBob: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [goes to the end of the diving board as drumroll is being played; he attempts to perform his stunt, but since he was upside-down, he falls to the ground] Ahh! Ooh.
[The crowd groans and leaves in disappointment.]
Mr. Krabs: Get your SpongeBob standees right here. Buy one and take home a loser. [chortles]
SpongeBob: [gets up] I just don't understand it. Surface divers go down. Why didn't I go up?
Sandy: Well, back in Texas, Olympic divers have gravity to help them go down. What you need is anti-gravity to go up.
SpongeBob: Anti-gravity? Yes! [pops lightbulbs out from his body] Yah! [sucks the lightbulbs in his body and giggles]
[SpongeBob runs back in his house. Then he comes back out on the diving board with balloons tied around his waist.]
Squidward: [picks up trash around his house] Hmph. Stupid messy moron rubbernecking flounders and so on...
[SpongeBob goes to perform his stunt and successfully dives off the diving board. The balloons help him float in the air while Squidward continues grumbling as he picks up the trash.]
SpongeBob: I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
[SpongeBob floats into a swarm of jellyfish. Jellyfish fly around him as he continues floating to the surface. They make a stairway for him and SpongeBob climbs higher and higher.]
SpongeBob: I'm the first high-sea-diving sponge. [pulls out the little buoy from his nose]
[But just when he was about to reach the surface, a pile of garbage blocks everything. The balloons pop and SpongeBob holds onto a rope.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what happened to the surface?
[The screen zooms up to Bikini Atol where the garbage reveals itself as the Great Pacific garbage patch, floating on the surface and eventually causing water pollution.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Huh? [attaches himself to the garbage with the suction cups] Aw, gee, and I was so close. [kicks a bolt and it falls upward] Hmm? What is this place? [puts his little buoy in his head]
[SpongeBob searches around the trash. He climbs on an old television and slides down.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
[SpongeBob climbs on an old telephone receiver and it falls upward. He puts on a bowtie.]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
[SpongeBob strums on the giant comb like a harp. He giggles and the comb falls upward. SpongeBob climbs on another pile of trash.]
SpongeBob: This place is trash-tastic! [pounds on his chest and does a Tarzan-like yell; suddenly, someone throws a large key in SpongeBob's face.] Ow! [dodges an incoming pen] Oh, hey now! Whoa-whoa-whoa-oh-oh! [bumps into a giant car pump and it falls upward]
[Meanwhile, down on the ground, several townspeople began seeing stuff descending down from the Great Pacific garbage patch from above.]
Dave: What's that?
[The giant comb floats down.]
Evelyn: I don't know.
[The comb lands in front of a farmer.]
Farmer: Hmm. [grunts as he picks up the comb]
[The farmer places the comb on the back of the tractor. He climbs in the tractor and drives it. The comb is being used as a chisel plow and plants begin to sprout.]
Thaddeus: It's a gift!
Evelyn: From the sky?
Dave: From Neptune!
[A group of boy scout campers are setting up a tent.]
Boy Scout Campers: Yay! [the tent falls apart] Aww.
[A pen floats down to them.]
Boy Scout Campers: [gasps and fixes the tent with a pen] Thank you, Neptune!
[A recently married couple enter through a gate and are about to live in their dream home. But unfortunately, there was no home for them to live in.]
Groom: [sheepishly] I'm sorry, honey. I couldn't afford the whole house. Just the door!
[Just then, the giant car pump falls in place where the door is and makes a new house.]
Groom: [happy] Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Look at that!
Bride: Now there's room for my mother!
Groom: Whaa?!
[The bride waves as, the screen pans out and reveals really her tall mother with her packages.]
Bride's Mother: Ehh...
[Meanwhile, back up in the Great Pacific garbage patch, SpongeBob is still wandering around.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? I thought I saw something over—[gets hit by a giant plastic spoon] Ow! [sees a shadowy figure] Hello? Who are you?
[The mysterious figure comes out and reveals himself to be none other than Old Man Jenkins.]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm King Neptune! Feel my power! [throws a paperclip at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow! Old Man Jenkins? [pulls the paperclip off his face]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm not Old Man Jenkins anymore! I'm King Neptune! Take that! [throws a bottle cap at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [whimpers as he dodges the bottle cap] Huh? All right, I'll play along. Hey, King Neptune! I'm Poseidon! [laughs and throws a giant sandal at Old Man Jenkins]
Old Man Jenkins: [dodges sandal] Oh!
[Old Man Jenkins grabs a giant eraser and throws it at SpongeBob. The two of them get into a trash fight and the thrown trash are being floated down to Bikini Bottom from above. A butter knife floats down to a local business man.]
Business Man: Hmm? Neptune is blessing us with gifts and treasures! [changes into his bathing suit] Surf's up, dude!
[Gale and Nat are driving in a boat. Suddenly, a giant vacuum cleaner crashes down onto their boat. They both giggle and hop onto the vacuum. They drive the vacuum all over Bikini Bottom.]
Nat Peterson: Oh, yeah! All right! Ho-ho!
[A group of people gather around and a little girl is holding a bunch of balloons.]
Little Girl #1: You say your desire into the balloon, blow it up, and send it to Neptune. [whispers] A slice of pizza. [blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface]
Cara: [stretches balloon and speaks into it] A never-ending roll of toilet paper. [blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface]
Little Girl #2: [stretches balloon and speaks into it] A million grandmas. [blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface]
[Sooner or later, many balloons are floating upward to the surface. Meanwhile, back up in the Great Pacific garbage patch, SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins grow tired from their garbage fight. Old Man Jenkins walks up to SpongeBob and looks at him closely.]
Old Man Jenkins: You're not Poseidon. You're SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: [holds up a mirror] And you're Old Man Jenkins!
Old Man Jenkins: I was Old Man Jenkins 'til I came here. It was a year ago today...
[A flashback is shown with Old Man Jenkins celebrating his birthday with some elderly friends at Shady Shoals Rest Home.]
Senior Citizens: ♪Happy birthday to you♪
[One of Old Man Jenkins' friends gives him a bunch of balloons.]
Old Man Jenkins: Oh, thank you, dea— [begins to float away with the balloons] Hello? Some help, please?
Senior Citizens: [grumble and head back into the rest home] So now I gotta go back? I came all the way over here.
Old Man Jenkins: Hey—hey, come back here! Come back, now!
[The flashback ends. Just then, a yellow balloon appears and pops next to SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins, surprising them.]
Voice #1: Neptune, I want a mustache.
[Another balloon appears and pops.]
Voice #2: Neptune, I want a cool voice.
[Another balloon appears. SpongeBob catches the balloon and pops.]
Patrick: [voiceover] Neptune, I want another balloon.
[Another balloon appears and pops.]
Patrick: [voiceover] Now!
Old Man Jenkins: My subjects! I must get down to help them.
SpongeBob: Well, we could build a ladder out of this stuff and climb down—ooh, uh, down?
Old Man Jenkins: What are you, senile?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. I'm juvenile! [laughs]
[SpongeBob begins to grab several trash and stacks them up one by one in order to make a ladder to climb back down. Meanwhile, back down on the ground, the townsfolk are starting to get worried.]
Citizen #1: Hey, what happened?
Citizen #2: What's going on here?
Harold: Why isn't Neptune sending us more gifts down for us?
Gale Rechid: We must have upset him.
Harold: You must have upset him! [the townsfolk strap Gale to a death table and is prepared to be killed] This is for you, Neptune! Oohh— [prepares to kill her until...]
Gale Rechid: Wait! Look!
[SpongeBob's ladder made out of the garbage descends downward. The crowd gasps and murmurs in amazement.]
Citizen #3: Oh, it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
Citizen #4: What is it?
Gale Rechid: What do you think it is?
Harold: It's a ladder from Neptune! Let's climb up and get more free stuff!
Gale Rechid: Me first! [buffs up her muscles and breaks free]
[Gale runs up to the trash ladder and begins to climb it. Then several other townsfolk join in and follow her up the trash ladder. SpongeBob grabs an old soup can and finishes the ladder. The surface is now sparkly clean from the garbage patch.]
SpongeBob: Phew! It took every piece of the island to make this ladder. Ooh? Hey! Look at that! [pulls the little buoy out of his head and sticks it to the surface] I'm the first sponge to ever do that!
Old Man Jenkins: Big whoop.
SpongeBob: Oh, yes! It's the biggest whoop! Let's go home!
[SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins begin to climb down to the ocean floor. Suddenly, the ladder starts shaking.]
Old Man Jenkins: Stop shaking the ladder!
SpongeBob: I'm not shaking it!
[Down below the ladder, the townsfolk continue to climb up until they see SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins above.]
Gale Rechid: I think I see him! It's Neptune!
Fred: Oh, Neptune!
Citizens: Neptune! Out of my way!
[The townsfolk climb upward but suddenly stop.]
Gale Rechid: Wait a minute. [sees Old Man Jenkins climbing down] It's Old Man Jenkins!
Nat Peterson: Old Man Jenkins is Neptune?
Dale: All hail Old Man Jenkins!
Old Man Jenkins: Get off my trash, you idiots!
Dale: Praise Neptune! We're all idiots for you!
Citizens: We're all idiots! We're all idiots!
[The townsfolk's cheering causes the ladder to shake, knocking over SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Ooh-whaa! [clings onto another box]
Gale Rechid: Hey, it's SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Everybody climb back down! There's nothing up there! [climbs down to the townsfolk] I dove up and found Old Man Jenkins living among all these objects.
Gale Rechid: Then it was you that sent these treasures down!
Nat Peterson: Hooray for SpongeBob! He's our hero!
[The townsfolk cheer. But their cheering shakes the ladder even more.]
SpongeBob: No! Ahh! Ohh—ow!
[The ladder crumbles and all of the trash as well as SpongeBob, Old Man Jenkins, and the townsfolk are sent crashing down to Bikini Bottom. The city is now a complete mess with trash.]
Old Man Jenkins: [pops out from the trash, grabs a bottle cap and a fork, and stands on Nat Peterson's head] I'm King Neptune! King of the seven seas, the lakes, rivers, puddles...[spits saliva into a spittoon] And spit too! I'm the king of spit!
King Neptune: So you're the king of spit?
[Thunder roars]
Old Man Jenkins: [Nervously]Uh-oh.
[Out from the clouds, the real King Neptune appears on his chariot and he's not very happy.]
King Neptune: "Uh-oh" is right.
[Old Man Jenkins stands scared as Nat Peterson, upon seeing the real King Neptune, whimpers in fear. He grabs a suitcase and runs away. King Neptune ignites his trident and zaps Old Man Jenkins, burning him to a crisp.]
Old Man Jenkins: I smell like toast. Am I breakfast? [bites off his hand] Needs jelly.
[Mr. Krabs comes by and notices the pile of trash. He also notices SpongeBob's hands sticking out from underneath.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? [pulls out a mortally wounded SpongeBob] Ooh, well, look at that. Someone threw away a good SpongeBob standee. [laughs and throws SpongeBob in his truck-load of SpongeBob-standees] Yagh! [closes the trunk] Oof! [climbs in the truck] Ugh.
[Mr. Krabs drives away with his truck, carrying SpongeBob and the standees inside.]
SpongeBob: They called me a hero.


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward are cleaning Mr. Krabs' office.]
SpongeBob: [being used as a scrub brush to clean the window] Ooh—[gasps] Ooh—[gasps] Yeah! Don't you just love cleaning day?
Squidward: [wrings SpongeBob in the mop bucket] We're so lucky.
SpongeBob: Aww. Mr. Krabs' first dollar. [sprays the picture frame, pulls his face off and scrubs it clean before putting it back on; however, the dollar is reduced to two quarters] Whaa? [he sprays the picture frame again and scrubs it clean with his head; this time, it reduced into a penny] Huh? [he sprays the picture frame again and scrubs it clean with his back; this time, the picture frame is completely blank; SpongeBob takes out a dollar, licks it and pastes it onto the picture frame]
Mr. Krabs: Don't forget to clean the safe, boys. And keep your eyes on the Krabby Patty secret formula! [leaves]
Squidward: Hey, we need the combination!
SpongeBob: I got it covered. [turns the lock, goes to open it, but breaks his arm]
Squidward: Nyah!
SpongeBob: [hums as he pulls a piece of rolled-up paper from his broken arm] Doink! [snaps his arm back in place and chuckles as he reads the paper before turning the lock] Mm. Mm-hmm. [opens the safe] Voilà!
Squidward: [garbage falls out from the safe] Ahh—ooh! [pops out from the garbage]
SpongeBob: See? This is fun!
[Meanwhile, outside the Krusty Krab, Plankton is once again devising his latest scheme to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.]
Plankton: [laughs and holds out a strange helmet] Krabs will never see me coming! Presso-inviso! [pushes the button on the helmet and his body turns invisible; he hums as he walks to the restaurant, but trips over] Ahh! Can't see my own feet.
[Back in the restaurant, SpongeBob is taking care of the secret formula like he's caring an infant.]
SpongeBob: [wraps a diaper around the bottle] Mm-hmm. [hums as puts the formula on a blanket and gives it a teddy bear and a baby bottle; then he wraps it with the blanket]Don't you go anywhere while I clean your homey-womey.
[As SpongeBob dusts the safe, Squidward dumps trash in the trashcan with the secret formula still inside. He then goes to dump it out through the window.]
Squidward: Out of sight...[Plankton laughs as he goes to the window] Out of my mind. [dumps the garbage on Plankton]
Plankton: [pops out from the garbage] Hey, watch it! [he sees the formula next to him and blubbers in surprise] Hommina—wah? The secret formula! Must be one of Krabs' tricks! [grabs the formula and makes a run for it] He'll pop out any second now. [stops in front of the Chum Bucket] Well? [silence] Nothing. All right. [turns around and heads back in the Chum Bucket] I really did it! [goes to the kitchen where Karen is mixing chum with the grinder] Hey, Karen, guess what?! I finally got the Krabby Patty secret formula! How do you like me now?
Karen: [scans the bottle until her screen says, "Secret Formula equals Genuine"] It's genuine. Come here, you big hunk of aquatic organism! Ooh, I knew you could do it![hugs Plankton and kisses him] Just don't blow it this time. 
[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is finishing up cleaning the office. He notices the Krabby Patty formula is gone from the trashcan.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Oh! Ahh! [looks all over the office] Hey, Squidward, have you seen the Krabby Patty secret formula? [lifts the desk and drops it] Ohh! [pulls out from underneath] I put it right here in this circular file cabinet.
Squidward: That's a trash can, you nitwit! [SpongeBob looks at the item closer while Squidward sits back but suddenly gets scared] The formula?! [cuts to them looking for the formula outside] Face it, SpongeBob! [gets trash thrown in his face] The formula—
SpongeBob: Don't say it!
Squidward: Is gone.
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Oh, I asked you not to say it! [unscrews his eyeballs and cries a fountain of tears] Why would you ever do that?
Squidward: [comforts SpongeBob] Come on. [throws him in through the window; cuts to them back in the office] Now let's see if the security cameras picked anything up. [pushes the button under Mr. Krabs' desk and a keyboard comes out] Hmm. [types on the keyboard and turns on the television while SpongeBob gasps in amazement]
Patrick: [on screen as he opens a trash can] Hi! I like to order—hmm—half a Krabby Patty, please! [digs in the trash can and pulls out a half-eaten Krabby Patty] Oh, thank you. [laughs then eats it]
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward types on the keyboard to go to another footage. The footage shows Bubble Bass reading a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book while eating a Krabby Patty. Squidwardr pans out the footage, only to show that Bubble Bass is doing all this on the toilet in the bathroom. SpongeBob and Squidward both exclaim and groan in disgust. Squidward types on the keyboard and goes to the next footage. The footage shows the Krabby Patty formula outside the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Ah! It's alive!
Squidward: Hold on. [types the keyboard and zooms in on the footage to reveal Plankton holding the formula] Plankton?!
SpongeBob: Ahh! [his face falls off his body and falls over; he gasps] What are we gonna do?
Squidward: [grabs SpongeBob and breathes in and out of him like he's a paper bag.] Okay. All right. We'll just pretend everything's normal until closing time. Then we'll steal the formula back from Plankton! Yeah!
[Back at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is struggling to remove the cork from the bottle in hopes of reading the formula.]
Plankton: Come on! Open up! [tries to open it with his teeth but fails] Ahh! [tries to saw it open and stomp on it, but they also fail; posing as a genie from "Spin the Bottle"] Open Sesame? [tries to burn it with a flamethrower, but it also fails as he ends up getting burned himself; he tries to blow it up with explosives, but it also fails as they blew up part of the Chum Bucket] It's no use, Karen. It won't budge.
Karen: Of course not, Einstein, it has a time lock. [points to time lock on the cork] It won't open until tomorrow morning.
Plankton: Well, I've waited this long. [opens the safe and puts the formula in it] What's a few more [closes the safe and talks loudly] excruciatingly long [calmly] hours? [turns the lock]
[It is now nighttime at the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs is locking the doors.]
SpongeBob: [nervously] Night, Mr. Krabs. Sleep tight.
Squidward: [nervously] Don't let the bed urchins bite.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, sure. You, too, you two. [climbs in his boat and drives away home while SpongeBob and Squidward laugh nervously as they wave good-bye]
Squidward: Okay, let's go get that formula.
SpongeBob: Ooh, we are gonna pull [imitates Plankton] a Plankton on Plankton! [laughs]
[SpongeBob and Squidward sneak behind the Chum Bucket. Squidward goes to the front doors, but a meow sound startles him.]
Squidward: Nyah! Whaa?
SpongeBob: [appears in a cat costume] Sorry. [laughs] Stepped on my tail.
Squidward: What are you wearing?
SpongeBob: I'm a cat burglar! [purrs and meows around Squidward and stops] Okay, I'll change. [rips off his cat costume]
[SpongeBob and Squidward go to the front doors. Squidward attempts to push them open, but it is locked.]
SpongeBob: Hang on. [slips in underneath] Ooh.
Squidward: And just how am I supposed to get in? [SpongeBob grabs him by the legs and pulls him in underneath, accidentally ripping his eyes out] Ooh! [grumbles as he grabs his eyes and puts them back on his face]
[SpongeBob peaks through the sewer lid and sees nothing around. He pops out and slides behind the Chum Bucket's menu. He slithers down from the wall, leaving two dents on his body. He and Squidward hide under a table. Squidward bashes SpongeBob on the head to straighten himself out. Plankton is seen watching a scary old movie.]
TV Monster: [growls]
TV Actress: Ahh!
Plankton: [slurps on soda and eats some popcorn] Yeah, yeah, now eat her brain! [sighs] I love a good romance. [turns off the TV and yawns]
[Plankton hops off his chair while SpongeBob and Squidward hide under the table. Plankton scratches himself and goes into the bathroom. SpongeBob and Squidward follow him. Plankton flosses his teeth with his antenna. His machine brushes his teeth and pours mouth wash in Plankton's mouth. Plankton gargles the mouth wash and swooshes it up in his mouth. His machine places a hair curler on his antennas. He spits the mouth wash in a cup the machine is holding for him. Plankton dips his eyeball in the mouth wash, causing it to burn. The machine sprays eye drops in his eyeball to make it feel better. SpongeBob and Squidward made it to the bathroom where they almost got caught as Plankton exits through the small door. Plankton goes to the elevator and goes up.]
SpongeBob and Squidward: Phew.
Plankton: [exits the elevator] Good night, honey. [blow kisses to Karen]
[Karen snores as she sleeps in her bed. Plankton hops onto his bed, claps his hands to turn off the lights and goes to sleep. SpongeBob sneaks into the bedroom through the doorknob. He slithers past Karen and goes to check on Plankton.]
Squidward: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Making sure he's asleep.
[SpongeBob opens Plankton's eyelid and sees his eyeball snoring. SpongeBob gives Squidward a thumbs up, letting him know that Plankton is sound asleep. Squidward groans. The screen cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward tiptoeing all over the laboratory as they search for the formula. SpongeBob's pants and torso walk off, leaving SpongeBob's head and arms in tact in midair. SpongeBob hears a growling noise.]
SpongeBob: Yeesh! [runs over to Squidward as he torso and upper body reattach themselves] Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Squidward scream as a monstrous shadow roars at them. They run around in panic until something pounces onto Squidward. It was Plankton's pet amoeba, Spot.]
SpongeBob: Aww, it's Plankton's little pet, Spot. He wants to play!
Squidward: [Spot is licking him all over] Will you get him off of me?! [tries to shake Spot off his legs]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Ahh! [grabs a fuel rod, which zaps his body as his skeleton is shown, and whistles] Get the stick, boy! [Spot sees the fuel rod and barks happily] Fetch! [throws the fuel rod and Spot goes after it through the front doors; SpongeBob then locks the doors shut]
Squidward: Look out!
[A sleepy Karen rolls in behind SpongeBob.]
Karen: Diodes...zebras...Make a new batch of chum...[snores]
SpongeBob: It's okay. She's in sleep mode.
Karen: Oh, dear, the chum is escaping. [grabs SpongeBob and Squidward, stuffs them in the chum grinder and grinds them both into chum; she snores as she rolls away]
[SpongeBob and Squidward, now grinded up into a pile of chum, slithers away. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Squidward hiding in empty toxic waste cans and rolling themselves over to the safe where Plankton is keeping the formula. They pop out of the cans and walk over to the safe.]
Squidward: This must be it.
[SpongeBob pushes the buttons on the doors. The alarm goes off and an electric eye looks down on them.]
Electric eye: Remain still for retina scan.
Squidward: Now what'll we do?
SpongeBob: Good thing I brought this! [pulls out a criminal picture of Plankton] They really captured the cute little dimple on his chin.
Squidward: Looks like they captured the rest of him too!
[The electric eye scans the picture and approved it. The electric eye closes itself up and opens the doors. The safe is at the far end.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
Squidward: I'll take it from here. [pushes SpongeBob aside]
SpongeBob: I'm fine.
[Squidward goes for the safe, but he steps on a tile, setting off a trap. A giant boot squishes Squidward flat.]
Squidward: You go first this time.
SpongeBob: Hmm-mmph. [goes for the safe, but steps on a tile setting off another trap]
[A hammer slams onto Squidward.]
SpongeBob: You okay? [steps on another tile, setting off another trap]
Squidward: No! [gets incinerated by fire underneath him]
[SpongeBob moves over to a different tile, but sets off another trap. A pair of robot arms gives Squidward a wedgie. SpongeBob runs around in panic, stepping on more tiles and setting off more traps. A bowling ball crushes Squidward's foot.]
Squidward: Ow. [gets slapped in the face by a robotic arm]
SpongeBob: [stands on a tile and doesn't move as it sinks down into the floor] I'm standing still! I'm not even doing anything!
[Squidward gets electrocuted by the electrical bolts. Then he gets crushed by a piano followed by a spiked-ball and a boat that resembles Titanic. Squidward is now reduced to liquid and slithers over to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Heh...sorry. [gathers Squidward up and puts him in a bucket.]
[SpongeBob walks over to the safe and revives Squidward back into his normal form. He turns the lock on the safe.]
SpongeBob: Ahh. [the safe opens to reveal the secret formula; he laughs] I can't believe that actually worked! [touches the bottle and the alarm goes off]
[The tile below SpongeBob and Squidward sends them flying into a rocket. The rocket closes and blasts out from the Chum Bucket with a screaming SpongeBob and Squidward inside. The rocket crash lands in the back of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward roll out from the rocket and are completely singed and injured. It is now dawn and Mr. Krabs drives up to the front doors. He goes to unlock the doors and sees SpongeBob and Squidward.]
Mr. Krabs: Good morning, Krusty crew! Ready to cook up a new batch of Krabby Patties? Er...[sees SpongeBob and Squidward singed and injured] Why are you two smoldering?
SpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: [covers SpongeBob's mouth] No, he's delirious! He doesn't know what he's saying.
SpongeBob: [pushes Squidward away] No! Mr. Krabs deserves the truth. We accidentally threw away the Krabby Patty formula and Plankton found it! We tried to steal it back, but we failed! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: [gets really angry and smoke steams out of his eyestalks] You did what!?!?!? Plankton stole me formula?!
Squidward: [he and SpongeBob nod their heads] That's what he said. Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: [calmly] Then I'll just have to steal it back. [walks over to the Chum Bucket] Hmm. Uh-huh. [punches a hole through the wall and grabs the secret formula from inside] Oh. [kisses the bottle] Don't worry. Papa's here.
[The scene changes the scallop making its rooster call to Bikini Bottom. Plankton, now awake, goes to the safe.]
Plankton: Oh, yeah! [looks at himself with his pocket mirror] Who's the man? You are! Eh, man.
[Plankton throws the mirror away. He turns the lock on the safe. He opens it and reveals Spot with the fuel rod barking happily at him. The hole behind Spot was the same hole Mr. Krabs made when he retrieved the formula. Spot jumps onto Plankton with the fuel rod and licks him while in doing so, zapping his body and showing his skeleton.]
Plankton: No, no, no! Krabs!
[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I'm sure glad the formula is back in the safe where it belongs, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Me, too, boy-o. And to make sure you two don't ever take your eyes off it again, I have a surprise for you. [SpongeBob and Squidward are stuffed in the safe] You're me new security system. [closes the safe and laughs before he leaves]
SpongeBob: Yay!
Squidward: Wait! I'm claustrophobic!


Note: The instances of "My leg" are all numbered in this order:

[The episode begins with a television fuzzing on the screen. The screen starts at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. SpongeBob backs the boat against the lighthouse and Mrs. Puff inflates herself. The lighthouse knocks over and falls onto Fred's leg.]
Fred: My leg! (1) (1) [gets hit by antenna; the screen then shows Fred at the circus, where he is run over by an old man's stroller and crushes his leg in the process] Ah! My leg! (2) (2) [the screen then shows Fred doing weight lifting, where the weights crush his legs] My leg! (3) (3) [the screen then shows Fred fishing out his leg] Hmm? My leg! (4) (4) [the screen then shows Fred being part of Charlie's magic show, where his leg is detached] My leg! (5) (5) [the screen then shows Fred changing the channel on his television, where his leg is shown] My leg? (6) (6) [the screen then shows Fred being crush by a steamroller, which hurts BOTH of his legs] My leg?! (7) (7) [the screen then shows Fred's leg being drilled in the garbage disposal]  My leg! (8) (8) [the screen then shows Fred's dress being blown by an air vent, revealing realistic legs] My leg... (9) (9) [the screen then shows Fred's leg being sawed off, and then taken, by aliens] My leg! (10) (10) [the screen then shows Fred being served as a dinner entrée to a hungry human at a restaurant] My leg! (11) (11) [the screen then shows Fred's leg being zapped by a mad scientist; he whimpers] My leg! (12) (12)
[Finally, the screen shows Fred sitting in the fields next to a coral tree. A leaf floats down on his leg and it disintegrates into dust.]
Doctor: [chuckles] That last one put my daughter through college. [Fred growls at him] All right, let's get this over with. [holds out a really big spinning blade]
Fred: [gasps and the doctor saws his cast] My leg, (13) (13) my leg, (14) (14) my leg, (15) (15) my leg, (16) (16) my leg! (17) (17) MY LEEEEEEEEG!!! (18) (18)  [the cast comes apart] Ooh, hmm! Feels great! Thanks, Doc! [accidentally kicks the doctor's face]
Doctor: I'm glad, Fred. But you've got to be more careful with... [pulls down an x-ray of Fred's leg] your leg! (19) [rolls the x-ray back up]
Fred: Ah, come on, Doc. It's just my leg! (20) (19) [accidentally kicks the doctor out the window] I've got another one.
Doctor: Just your leg? (21) [climbs back in through the window, grabs Fred's leg and whacks Fred in the face] JUST YOUR LEG?! (22) [lets go of Fred's leg] All right, Fred, the next time you come in here with a hurt leg (23), I'm going to replace it with... [opens cabinet]
Fred: With what?
Doctor: [holds up a robotic leg] A ROBOT LEG! (24)
Fred: Cool!
Doctor: It might be cool to you, Fred, but how does the robot feel about it? [pulls out a robot and it grabs Fred]
Tom (robot): Don't take my leg! (25) (20) Don't take my leg! (26) (21) [sobs]
Fred: [pulls the robot off him] Okay, Doc, I get it. I'll take better care of my leg! (27) (22) I promise. [leaves]
Doctor: Nice job, Tom.
[The doctor and Tom, the robot, give each other a high-five. The scene changes to Fred exiting the hospital, where he meets up with SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [holding flowers and a balloon] Hello, Fred. Your leg! (28) Looks great.
Fred: Stay away from my leg! (29) (23) SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, Fred, I'm so sorry I drove that freight train onto your leg! (30)
[The scene changes into a flashback. Fred is stretching his leg out onto the railroad will sipping down a drink. Suddenly, SpongeBob comes rolling by the tracks on a small freight train laughing, running over Fred's leg.]
SpongeBob: [weakly] Heh, choo-choo...
Fred: My LEG! (31) (24)
[An ambulance drives by. The paramedics pick up Fred and drive him away to the hospital. The flashback ends and SpongeBob squiggles his body.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Flashbacks tickle.
[Fred ties a balloon around SpongeBob.]
Fred: Now please go away. [blows SpongeBob away and leaves]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know. I'll protect his leg! (32) From harm, incognito.
[SpongeBob pulls on the string, pops the balloon and flies into a nearby trashcan. He sees Fred is going to step in the oil puddle. He jumps out and falls flat onto the oil puddle so Fred wouldn't slip on it.]
SpongeBob: [as Fred steps on him] Ow, ow.
[SpongeBob, now covered in oil, gets up and sees Fred is going to slip on a banana peel. He slides underneath him and eats the banana peel. Fred is about to step on a pile of sea urchins. SpongeBob slides underneath him and shields him from the pointy spikes. SpongeBob sticks out his tongue and its covered with sea urchins. He sees Fred about to step on a foothold trap. SpongeBob steps in and gets into the trap to prevent Fred from stepping in it.]
SpongeBob: Yowch! [groans]
[SpongeBob continues to follow Fred and hops over to the place he works at: A construction factory.]
Fred: Hey, everybody! Look who's back!
Construction workers: "My leg!" (33) (25)
[As Fred goes to begin his job, SpongeBob, who is shaped like Fred, continues to follow him. He hides behind the drilling machine just as Fred is preparing to work. Fred begins his job by pushing logs through the drilling machine.]
SpongeBob: [rips himself in half] This is his job?! Oh no. Not safe. Must think. [puts on a fake mustache and construction helmet; talks in a deep voice] Welcome back, Fred. Nice leg (34) work. But you know, it's a lot safer if you use a...[pulls out a table leg] table leg (35) instead.
Fred: Wow! Really?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Now Fred, I wouldn't pull your leg! (36) Watch this. [pushes the log in the drilling machine, but ends up getting caught in the blades] Huh?
[With SpongeBob jamming the machine, it starts to overload and the construction workers flee the factory. The factory unleashes a devastating explosion. The smoke clears and SpongeBob pops out from the debris.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Well, at least Fred's leg! (37) is safe. [collapse on the ground; as he collapsed, he is cut into several pieces of wood]
[The scene changes to Fred receiving therapy from a octopus named Dr. Charley Horse.]
Fred: My leg! (38) (26) Is really stressing out, Dr. Charley Horse.
Dr. Charley Horse: [examining Fred's leg] Hmm. Uh-huh. [twists Fred's leg and bite it] You're right, Fred. It's so tense. But I've got just the remedy. Take off your shoes and follow me.
[Fred takes off his shoes and follows Dr. Charley Horse. SpongeBob and Patrick pop out of Fred's shoes.]
Patrick: [wearing a gas mask] So far this plan stinks.
SpongeBob: This is no time to be smelling stinks, Patrick. I need to protect Fred's leg! (39) And I can't do it alone.
Dr. Charley Horse: The only way to relax your leg! (40) Is to walk on... [removes the rug and reveals a patch of burning, hot coals underneath] hot coals.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hot coals?!
[SpongeBob goes to protect Fred while Patrick hides in a sock.]
Dr. Charley Horse: Now Fred, close your eyes, and repeat after me the ancient mantra: My feet (41) are cold. My feet (42) are cold.
Fred and Dr. Charley Horse: My feet (43) are cold.
Fred: My feet (44) are cold. [stretches his foot out over the hot coals]
[SpongeBob gasps and lays himself underneath Fred's feet as he prepares to walk on the hot coals.]
Fred: My feet (45) are cold. [walks on top of SpongeBob as he burns] My feet (46) are cold.
SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Fred: My feet (47) are cold.
[Fred makes it to the other end of the hot coals. SpongeBob hops out screaming in pain as his body is on fire. He flies around Fred.]
Fred: Whoa! [falls on the hot coals] MY BUTT! (48)
[SpongeBob flies around Dr. Charley Horse, accidentally making him step on the hot coals.]
Dr. Charley Horse: [his voice gets higher and starts to shrink as he walks on the hot coals] Oh my feet (49) are cold, my feet (50) are cold, my feet (51) are cold, my feet (52) are cold! [disappears; forms a word above the coals and whispers] Transcendence.
Fred: Oooohhhh!
[The scene changes to Fred walking in the streets in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick appearance in disguises as bodyguards.]
SpongeBob: [imitates static] All quiet on the right side.
Patrick: [imitates static] All quiet on the left side. [bashes Bubble Bass out of the way] Sorry, sir.
[SpongeBob moves an old woman out of the way.]
Old woman: Oh!
SpongeBob: Sorry, ma'am.
Fred: Hey, what's going on here?
[A girl scout appears in front of them.]
Girl Scout: Would you like to buy some cookies?
SpongeBob: Mayday, Chicken Leg! (53) (41) We got a situation on the griddle! [wraps his body around Fred's leg]
Patrick: [grabs the box of cookies] I got the weapon! [the girl scout bites his leg] Yow!
[The girl scout brutally beats Patrick up and whacks him around on the ground while holding his leg with her teeth. She heavily pants like a wild savage beast until picks up the box and returns to her sweet innocent self. She skips away and Fred removes SpongeBob's sunglasses.]
Fred: SpongeBob? Why are you following MY LEG?! (54) (27)  (42) [pulls SpongeBob off his leg]
SpongeBob: Fred, you have to listen to me. Your leg! (55) (43) Is in constant danger. Isn't that so, Patrick?
Patrick: I think I hurt my leg... (56) (28)  (44) [shows the bite mark on his leg]
SpongeBob and Fred: Your what?
Patrick: [screams] MY LEG!! (57) (29) (45)
[An ambulance arrives. The paramedics grab Patrick, throw him in, and drive him away.]
Fred: [sobs] Aw gee, some guys get all the lucky breaks. [kicks an empty can in SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: [pulls the can off his face] At least you know that your leg's! (58) (46) Perimeter is secured.
Fred: I know. I just miss being at the hospital.
SpongeBob: Why?
Fred: Well, secretly...
SpongeBob: Ooh! [leans closer to listen]
Fred: [whispers] I'm in love with a nurse.
SpongeBob: Ooh, you're in love with a nurse? Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! [forms into a heart and sighs; a cupid arrow pops SpongeBob back to his normal form] Fred, I've got an idea. Why don't we hurt your leg! (59) (47) So you can be reunited with your lady fair?
Fred: Let's do it! And we should step on it. It's almost time for her break.
SpongeBob: I'd say it's almost time for your break.
[SpongeBob and Fred share a laugh. SpongeBob takes out a toy hammer and hits Fred's leg with it, but it didn't do any physical harm.]
SpongeBob: I should probably use something stronger.
Fred: Yeah, probably.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Fred climbing over the wall at Bikini Bottom Jail. SpongeBob taps the shoulder of a nearby convict working on the rocks.]
Convict: Hmm?
[Fred stretches out his leg and SpongeBob quietly explains to the convict to hit it with his hammer.]
SpongeBob: Ahh?
Convict: Hmm? Mm-mm.
[SpongeBob grabs the hammer and goes to hit Fred's leg with it. But the hammer slips off his hand and it lands on the convict's foot. The screen becomes black and white and like a silent movie, the convict words "My Leg!" (60) (30) (48) appears on the screen when he screams. The ambulance arrives again. The paramedics climb out, throw the convict in, and drive away. SpongeBob and Fred snap their fingers in disgust. The scene changes to Fred and SpongeBob at Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob has three jellyfish in a net and battery chargers attached to it. He puts two other battery chargers on Fred's leg in attempt to have the jellyfish sting it.]
SpongeBob: [takes out a stick] Hmm. [pokes the net]
[The jellyfish come out of the net and repeatedly stings SpongeBob. SpongeBob comes back, now incredibly swollen, and snaps his finger in disgust. The scene changes to Fred sprinkling salt on his leg. SpongeBob rings the bell and the Alaskan Bull Worm appears. But instead of biting Fred's leg, it licks the salt off. Fred snaps his fingers in disgust. The scene changes to SpongeBob tying Fred's leg to the railroad tracks.]
SpongeBob: Trust me, Fred, your leg! (61) (49) Is as good as broken.
Fred: Oh, my sweet nurse angel. I'll be there soon, my love!
SpongeBob: And here comes the love train, right on schedule!
[A train with heart steaming out comes riding down the tracks. Just as the train gets closer, Tom the robot appears. Tom stops the train and throws it off the track.]
Tom (robot): Don't hurt your leg! (62) (50) Don't hurt your leg! (63) (51)
SpongeBob: Mr. Robot, that is very rude. How are we supposed to break Fred's leg! (64) (52) Now?
[Tom's head explodes in anger.]
Fred: He's just afraid if I hurt my LEG! (65) (31) (53) The doctor will replace it with his leg! (66) (54)
SpongeBob: Oh, is that all? Shucks, he can have my leg!  (67) (32) (55) It'll grow back. [pulls his left leg off] Boink! [sticks his leg on Tom] Enjoy.
Tom (robot): [laughing] Thank you, sponge man. This one is even better than my leg! (68) (33) (56)
[The ambulance arrives again. The paramedics climb out, throw Tom in, and float away.]
Fred: Aw, it's no use, SpongeBob. Maybe the nurse and me were never meant to be.
SpongeBob: Now, don't put your tail between your legs! (69) (57) Just yet, Fred. I've got the perfect plan to get you back to the hospital. Okay, here's what we do... [his left leg grows back, but it's smaller than normal] Heyyy! My leg! (70) (34) (58)
[The ambulance falls back down, crashing on top of Fred. The paramedics climb out, throw SpongeBob on the side, and drive away, leaving Fred with some tire marks.]
Fred: MY HEAD AND TORSO! (71) Wow, that's crazy. They hit me everywhere except MY LEGS! (72) (35) (59)
[The paramedics grab Fred and drive away. The scene changes to the hospital where SpongeBob, Patrick, the convict, and Tom the robot have their legs casted up. Fred, however, has his entire body casted up except for his legs.]
Fred: [sighs] Thank you, SpongeBob. If it wasn't for you, I never would have made it back to my angel goddess.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't thank me, Fred. Your leg! (73) (60) Did all the heavy lifting. I can't wait to meet this angel goddess of yours.
Fred: Well, wait no longer, SpongeBob. Hello, Nurse Bazooka!
SpongeBob: Nurse Bazooka?
[Fred's secret crush turns out to be a strong, bulky nurse named Nurse Bazooka. She enters the room with a wet sponge.]
Nurse Bazooka: Sponge bath time!
SpongeBob, Patrick, Convict, and Tom (robot): [all scared]No!
Patrick: [frantic]I don't want to! Oh, no, no! [cries]
Nurse Bazooka: ♪Scrub, scrub, scrubbity, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub♪ [grabs Patrick and violently scrubs him with the sponge]
Convict: No!
[Tom and the convict tremble in fear at the sight, but Fred doesn't seem to be afraid of her at all.]
Fred: You know, this reminds me of a song.
[Fred takes out a ukulele and begins to play music. Tom and the convict attempt to dig themselves out of the hospital to escape Nurse Bazooka, but eventually decides to join in the music. Fred saws his face out through the cast.]
Fred: ♪When I met you, my fingers went numb and my arms were all aloof. But I tripped over your heart. And now, my loneliness went poof. Becaaaaaause... my leg (74) (36) (61) is in love! Hey, my leg (75) (37) (62) is in love! Like an old, snug shoe that fits like a glove! My leg (76) (38) (63) is in love! Wow! My leg (77) (39) (64) is in love! Through my femur to the marrow is where Cupid shot an arrow! So, my leg (78) (40) (65) is in love! Whoa! My leg (79) (41) (66) is in love! My calves are getting restless! My quads are going crazy! I'm in love with a nurse and I think her name is Daisyyyyyy!♪
[Nurse Bazooka is wringing Patrick out with the wringer. She stops and starts listening to Fred's song about her.]
Nurse Bazooka: [blushes] Me?
Chorus: ♪His leg (80) (67) is in love! Yeah! His leg (81) (68) is in love!♪
Fred: ♪I really mean it! Yeah, my leg! (82) (42) (69)♪
Chorus: ♪His leg! (83) (70)♪
Fred: ♪Oh, yes!♪
Chorus: ♪Oh, yes!♪
Fred: ♪My le-eg (84) (43) (71) is in loooooovvvvve!♪
Chorus: ♪His leg (85) (72) is in love!♪
Fred: ♪Yeah!♪
SpongeBob: [as Cupid] Hey, I always wanted to show a little leg! (86) (73) [laughs]
Nurse Bazooka: [kisses Fred] Mwah, mwah, mwah.
[The screen closes and cuts Fred's leg off.]
Fred: [screaming] MY LEEEEEEEEEEEEEG!!! (87) (44) (74)
[The ambulance drives up. The paramedic takes Fred's leg and drives away, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. A mother and a baby passes by and is greeted by a polite gentleman. A raspberry noise is heard. The mother turns and gives the gentleman an angry look, thinking it was him who made the noise. The noise is heard again. They turn and see a long line standing in the Krusty Krab. It turns out to be Mustard Day and SpongeBob is giving away mustard to the customers.]
SpongeBob: Mustard, mustard, step right up for your mustard! [flips the mustard container] Some mustard for you. Eh, eh, eh. [sprays mustard on a little boy's Krabby Patty]
[The mustard forms into a t-rex and it roars mustard in the boy's face.]
Boy: [his face is covered in mustard] Cool!
SpongeBob: [flips the mustard container] A bit of the yellow for you. Doy. [sprays mustard on Frankie Billy's Krabby Patty]
[The mustard forms into a sailboat. It whistles and rings its foghorn before it melts onto the patty. Frankie Billy laughs and skips away. Nancy Suzy Fish comes up and whispers something in SpongeBob's ear.]
SpongeBob: Oh, okay. [winks at Nancy Suzy Fish] Eh. [hops and spins the mustard container before spraying the mustard into a handsome man] And a Mr. Mustard for you.
Nancy Suzy Fish: [purrs as walks with her Mr. Mustard while licking him] Mmm, yummy.
SpongeBob: Hyah! [attempts to give mustard to Frank, but the mustard container is all out and it cough out a small drop of mustard]
Customers: Aw.
SpongeBob: Hang on, folks, I'll be right back with more mustard. [hops on the mustard container and drives on it like a car] Whoo! [drives to the kitchen and goes to the condiment cabinet] Let's see. Ketchup. [slides ketchup door to mayonnaise door] Mayonnaise. [rolls up mayonnaise door to mustard door] Oh, mustard. [opens doors mustard door to find Mr. Krabs in it]
Mr. Krabs: Did you use up all me mustard?
SpongeBob: [stammering nervously] What?
Squidward: [filing his tentacle] Oh, who gives a flying fish about mustard?
SpongeBob: [gasps] But Squidward, without mustard I wouldn't be able to make a—
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patty! That's right, you're both hereby ordered to go down into the mustard mines! And bring me back more mustard!
Squidward: Mustard mines?
Patrick: [comes out of the condiment cabinet and is covered with mustard] Mmm, mustard. [takes a container off his head and grabs a packet of mustard] Uh... Ah. [squirts mustard in his mouth, eats it and burps]
Mr. Krabs: [wipes mustard off his face] And you are going down to the mustard mines too.
Walter Haddock: [offscreen] I wouldn't do that if I was you. [creepily comes in and spits on the grill]
[SpongeBob wipes the grill clean.]
Walter Haddock: That old mustard mine is cursed.
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs in fear] Cursed?
Mr. Krabs: [pushes SpongeBob away] What kind of curse?
Walter Haddock: It's, uh, er, one of those—The Mummy's Curse.
Mr. Krabs: [snickers] There's no such thing as mummies.
Walter Haddock: [holds up a creepy picture of his mother] We've all got mummies. Eh? [giggles] Mm-hmm. I've been in that mine. No one that enters gets out alive. [makes a creepy smile as a shrieking noise is heard; a spider crawls into his mouth and thunder claps]
SpongeBob: You got out and you're alive.
Walter Haddock: Ah, but am I?
Patrick: Yeah, you're standing right there.
Walter Haddock: But am I? [walks away in a creepy fashion]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, you're right—[notices that he's gone, but he sees his foot] Hmm.
Squidward: I see your foot.
Walter Haddock: [slides his foot back] No, you don't.
SpongeBob: Ah, his foot's gone!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward at the entrance to the mustard mines.]
Squidward: [looks at the map] This map doesn't show us where the mustard vein is located. Well, let's just start picking.
Patrick: [picking his nose] Way ahead of you, pal.
Squidward: Ugh. [turns and looks at the map again]
[Patrick reaches into his nostril and picks out his brain.]
Patrick: Ooh. [smears his brain on Squidward's shirt]
[Squidward turns and grunts in disgust. Patrick gets scared and runs over to SpongeBob. Squidward picks up his pickaxe and heads into the mustard mines.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasps and skips into the mines] ♪Oh, a-mining we will go! The mustard, it will flow! [bounce up and down really hard] With pick and axe without the facts! There's nothing that we know! Ta-da!♪
[SpongeBob and Patrick's violent bouncing causes a landslide and falling rocks seals off the entrance, much to their horror.]
Squidward: [Shocked and angry] Huh?! You nitwits! How will we get out now?
[SpongeBob and Patrick's realize their mistake as Patrick gets worried.]
Patrick: Ah, we're trapped in a mine! We'll never get out!
[Patrick goes into frantic panic and runs up and down the mine walls. He curls in a fetal position and acts crazy. He punches his chest and passes out.]
Squidward: [sighs and goes to check on Patrick] Krabby Patty, stat.
[SpongeBob takes out the ingredients and makes a perfect Krabby Patty. He gives it to Squidward and he feeds Patrick the patty. Patrick swallows the patty and slowly wakes up.]
Squidward: He's coming 'round.
Patrick: [weakly] Squidward. I—I need—
Squidward: What can I get for you?
Patrick: [pulls out the Krabby Patty from his mouth and stupidly] I need a little mustard for the Krabby Patty.
Squidward: [drops Patrick down in disgust at his idiocy] Why do I even bother? Maybe there's a back door.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, wait for us!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run over to Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Whoa.
[They stop at a long, deep shaft.]
Squidward: I wonder how deep it is.
SpongeBob: I'll check. [picks up a pebble, goes over the edge and falls into the shaft] Wahhh! [appears next to Squidward and Patrick] Don't bother jumping. That shaft has no bottom. Let's take the escalator.
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick aside] All right, spread out! [goes on the escalator]
[SpongeBob and Patrick follow and go on the escalator with Squidward. They see coal miners go up the escalator.]
SpongeBob: Coal miners.
[They see sulfur miners go up the escalator. The awful smell from the sulfur makes SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward cover their noses.]
SpongeBob: Ew.
Patrick: Sulfur miners.
SpongeBob: Phew.
[They see a group of kids go up the escalator.]
SpongeBob: Unaccompanied minors. [drum sting]
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward walk off the escalator.]
Squidward: All right, let's get to work, chowderheads.
[They go in separate directions while bumping into each other for a little bit. SpongeBob digs up a yellow rock with his pickaxe.]
SpongeBob: Hey, I found something yellow. [pulls the yellow rock out of the wall; he was happy at first, but turned sad] Never mind, it's just gold. [throws it away]
Patrick: All I'm getting is dumb old diamonds. [throws and kicks several diamonds]
SpongeBob: [carrying a handful of gold nuggets] This must be the Mummy's Curse that old guy was talking about. [throws the gold nuggets in the stalagmite]
Squidward: Gold and diamonds? [digs up sand from the wall] Gold dust! No, no, it's just sand.
[Up above the surface, Ryan is minding his own business playing in the sandbox. Suddenly, the sand begins to form a whirlpool and sucks Ryan down underneath.]
Ryan: Whoa! [screaming]
[Ryan comes out from the hole Squidward dug up and he runs around in panic.]
Squidward: [upon seeing Ryan] Ah.
[Ryan continues to run and scream in panic until he calms down when he goes up the escalator.]
Squidward: Uh, what was that?
SpongeBob: [sighs] The greatest treasure of all, a child.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward resume their task. All of a sudden, SpongeBob begins to sniff out something. He sniffs the wall and punctures a hole on it with the pickaxe. It turns out that he dug up a payphone underneath the wall. The phone rings and SpongeBob answers it.]
SpongeBob: Hello?
Mr. Krabs: [with angry customers yelling in the background] SpongeBob, where's me mustard?
Jennifer Millie: I want some mus—[Mr. Krabs pushes her away with his foot]
SpongeBob: On the way, sir, as soon was we find it. [hangs up but answers again] Love you. [hangs up again]
Squidward: Oh, we'll never find that mustard vein. [pokes the wall with the pickaxe and the wall crumbles into a hole, leading him to the subway] Oh, what is this? [wonders around the subway]
Subway PA: Local train approaching station.
[Deep in the tunnel, a train emerges and stops in front of Squidward. The train opens its doors, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick already on board. Squidward stares at them in shock, wondering how they managed to get on so quick and afford a train ride.]
SpongeBob: Hurry up, Squidward, before the doors close!
Patrick: It's the last train of the night!
SpongeBob: Do you have a metro card?
[Squidward frantically searches for a metro card until he finds one under his shirt.]
Squidward: Ah! I got it! [tries to scan his card, but the tumblers keep beeping red]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward!
[Squidward tries all his might to scan his card as he watches the train doors slowly close in horror.]
Subway PA: Watch the closing doors.
[Squidward buffs up his arm and the tumbler finally turns green, approving access to it. Squidward runs through the tumblers and frantically heads to the train.]
SpongeBob: Faster, Squidward, faster!
[Squidward makes it, but the doors close on his neck, leaving his body being dragged outside of the moving train.]
Patrick: Hey, Squidward, you really should watch the closing doors.
[Squidward growls and hisses at Patrick in complete anger and frustration, as Patrick backs away.]
Subway PA: This is a local mining train making all stops between Coal and Limestone. Next stop, Condiments.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's our stop.
[The train stops at the condiments vein. The doors open. SpongeBob steps over a battened Squidward and heads to the condiments vein. Patrick runs out and steps on Squidward, but grabs him by the feet.]
Patrick: Come on, Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Patrick scurry into the condiments vein while Squidward, being carried by Patrick, hits his head on the sign. Patrick sets Squidward down. Squidward walks around in a dizzy fashion, but pulls himself together. Squidward knocks on the wall and punctures a hole with his pickaxe. Mayonnaise comes out of the wall and sprays into Squidward's face.]
Squidward: Hmm. [sticks out his tongue] Ah, la, hmm. [licks the mayo] Ah! I've struck mayo!
[SpongeBob punctures a hole on a different wall and a drop of hot sauce flies onto his tongue. He tastes the dropping and his body flares up, burning himself to a crisp.]
SpongeBob: Hot sauce. [his body crumbles into ashes]
[Patrick goes to puncture a wall with his pickaxe, but flips over and falls to the ground; his pickaxe punctures a hole on the wall and ketchup spews out.]
Patrick: I struck blood! [grabs some of the ketchup and tastes it] Oh, no, it's ketchup! [slurps some more]
SpongeBob: We're getting close. [punctures a hole on the ground and mustard comes out; he takes a sample of mustard] Oh. [licks the mustard] Mustard. Ahhh! I struck mustard!
Squidward: Mustard?
Patrick: Mustard?
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: [dancing around in circles while twisting SpongeBob's body] ♪Look at all the mustard flow! Look at all the mustard flow! That golden yellow fatty acid treat!♪
[SpongeBob unravels himself, sending Squidward and Patrick flying to another wall. SpongeBob warms himself up and goes to crack open the ground again. But the ground was so thick that is disintegrates his pickaxe.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no, what are we gonna do now?
Squidward: I think we better use our heads.
Patrick: Let's use my head. [pulls his tongue and his pointy head revs up like a power drill]
[SpongeBob and Squidward go to use Patrick's drilling head to drill a hole in the ground. When all of a sudden, they hear a moaning sound. Smoke fumes around the tunnels and a shadowy creature appears.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: The mummy!
[The smoke clears and the shadowy figure reveals himself to be none other than the crazy old prospector, Walter Haddock.]
Walter Haddock: Stop!
[Walter Haddock leaps in front of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, pulls a cork out from his mouth and plugs up the hole in the ground.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] It's the Mummy's Curse guy!
Walter Haddock: There ain't no curse! I just tried to discourage you chuckleheads from mining this mustard!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it, 'cause the mummy wants the mustard. Mystery solved.
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: Hurrah!
Walter Haddock: [twitches his eye] 'Tain't no mummy! This mustard is sitting on top of 20 million pounds of pressure! If you open her up, she's gonna blow sky high!
SpongeBob: Oh, no curse. No mummy. And no mustard. [sniffs] And I'll have to find another job! [cries and blows his nose on Squidward's nose]
Squidward: [pulls his nose back] Stop. Don't you see? This old coot wants all the mustard for himself! Now uncork that mustard!
Walter Haddock: Hmm? [growls]
Squidward: Oh, put your fists down, old man. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Walter Haddock: Hyah! [punches Squidward in the face]
[Squidward falls over.]
SpongeBob: You were right, Squidward, you're not gonna hurt him.
Squidward: [gets up and is really angry] Why you— [gets punched in the face again] Ow! [gets punched again] I'm gonna— [gets punched and his head spins; then he gets punched again]
SpongeBob: Go, Squidward, you're winning! You're not hurting him at all!
Patrick: [buffs up] Let me try not hurting him. [grabs Squidward and throws him aside] Come on, old-timer! You know you want a piece of me! [Walter Haddock punches Patrick on the head and sends him flying and crashing onto the hole in the ground] Oh.
Walter Haddock: [in pain]Ow, that hurt!
Patrick: [Getting up] I hurt him! [Stupidly and disappointed] That means I lose.
[Suddenly, the ground underneath begins the shake, due to the force of Patrick's fall. Cracks begins to form and Walter Haddock dodges the incoming stalagmites from the ground. The mustard from underground begins to build up pressure and is about to erupt.]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! [tries to hold down the pressure, but the mustard begins to fill up inside his body] Whoa....!
Walter Haddock: Adiós, muchachos!
[Walter Haddock laughs manically and bounces around until he calms down when he goes up the elevator. Cracks form underneath Squidward and the crack uncovers a payphone next to him.]
Squidward: Hmm. [phone rings and he answers it] I'll get it. Hello.
Mr. Krabs: [on a mast above the angry customers] Where's me mustard?!
Squidward: Um...
[Pressure builds up as SpongeBob's body grows bigger and bigger from the upcoming mustard. Patrick tries his best by corking up the holes. At the Krusty Krab, the customers continue to riot against Mr. Krabs. One customer is chopping the mast down with his axe. The screen zooms out to reveal volcanic pocket of mustard underneath the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: Your mustard is coming right up.
Mr. Krabs: [as the mast falls] When?!
Squidward: Now?
[SpongeBob can't hold the pressure much longer as his eyes fill up with mustard. The ground under the Krusty Krab rumbles and erupts a geyser of mustard through the roof. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce up and down on top of the geyser.]
SpongeBob: Wow! Yee-ha! Yeah!
[The mustard fills up the Krusty Krab inside. The customers are now satisfied and go to swim around in the mustard as well as eat their patties with mustard. Among them stands a mummy, who is unimpressed.]
Mummy: What, no relish?


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs takes the paper containing the secret formula out of the bottle and looks at it. He writes down stuff on another piece of paper and puts the formula back in the bottle.]
Mr. Krabs: [gives SpongeBob the paper] Alright, take this, boy-o. And study it very carefully.
SpongeBob: [looks at the paper] Right! Oh-ho! Ha. Mr. Krabs. [shows a drawing of money wearing a bikini and a whistle sound effect]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Not that side! [turns paper around]
SpongeBob: [studies the paper] Oh. Huh. A shopping list?
Mr. Krabs: We're running low on secret ingredients. I need you to go shopping.
[As Mr. Krabs talks to SpongeBob, the Chum Bucket is hearing the conversation outside through a giant stethoscope while Plankton is listening through headphones attached to a monitor.]
Mr. Krabs: But be careful not to lose the list. If you-know-who gets his hands on it, he'll know what goes into the Krabby Patty. You know where that leads. Total apocalypse!
[Plankton's monitor shows an atomic explosion on the screen.]
Plankton: More like "funpocalypse"! [cackles] I'll just follow that yellow nitwit and the secret ingredients will be mine!
[Suddenly, the monitor begins to hear SpongeBob's laughter. The screen shows the image of SpongeBob's face laughing and Plankton screams as it electrocutes him through the headphones. The monitor short-circuits and explodes. The scene changes to SpongeBob walking down the street with the shopping list.]
SpongeBob: ♪Shopping spree! That's for me! A list of goodies from the sea! Shopping spree! That's for me! A list of goodies from the sea! Shopping spree! That's for me! A list of goodies from the sea!♪
[As SpongeBob sings and dances down the street, Plankton, who was hiding in a pedestrian's face, follows. SpongeBob dances over Fred and his boat. Plankton hides in the boat's wheel, peeks out and follows. Plankton is on the rooftop of a nearby building. He shoots a grappling hook down and ties it to a pipe. He swings down and goes to reach for the list, but he misses when SpongeBob goes in a different direction. Plankton crashes into a stop sign and falls flat on the ground. He goes to get up but gets stepped on by SpongeBob's shoe. He screams in agony as he continuously gets stepped on by SpongeBob. The scene changes to SpongeBob looking at the list as he walks.]
SpongeBob: Wow. The stuff on this shopping list is pretty exotic. I'm not gonna find any of this at Barg'N-Mart.
[SpongeBob bumps into an acorn-shaped submarine Sandy is working on and spins over to Sandy.]
Sandy: [removes her wielding mask] Whatcha got there, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [still spinning] Hold on. [stops spinning and shows Sandy the shopping list as he whispers] Something super secret.
[Plankton, who is disguised as the anchor design on SpongeBob's Krusty Krab hat, leans over and listens.]
Sandy: [looks at the paper] Yeah. I guess you'd want to keep this secret. [shows the drawing of money wearing a bikini from before]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not that side. [turns paper around to show the shopping list]
Sandy: Holy moly! You're gonna have to go to tarnation and back to get all these things.
SpongeBob: Well, what do I do?
Sandy: Ah, no worries. I just souped up old Matilda here.
[SpongeBob rubs Sandy's submarine and it revs up.]
Sandy: I think she likes ya.
[SpongeBob blushes and giggles with shyness. The scene changes inside the submarine. Sandy is setting up the coordinates for the locations of the items on the list. Plankton hops off of SpongeBob's hat and hides in the tool box. SpongeBob begins to sweat and gasp since the submarine has no water in it. SpongeBob's body then dries up.]
SpongeBob: [wheezes] Sandy, does it seem a little dry in here? [his finger snaps]
Sandy: Huh? Oh, possum pits! How could I forget? [puts on her helmet]
[Sandy opens the hatch and lets water into the submarine. SpongeBob's body soaks up and SpongeBob starts breathing again.]
SpongeBob: [gasps and sighs] Thanks.
Sandy: Buckle up!
[Sandy and SpongeBob buckle their seatbelts. Sandy activates the submarine and it swims off away from the treedome. The submarine swam too fast that it knocked over some rocks. SpongeBob and Sandy's faces flatten as the submarine speeds up. The tool box slides back with Plankton inside.]
Plankton: [hits his head against the interior of the tool box] Ow! What? [screams as incoming tools fly straight at him]
[Plankton dodges the incoming tools until they stopped.]
Plankton: Whew! [screams as an incoming hammer squishes him, leaving him crushed]
[The scene changes to Sandy flying her submarine over snowy mountains. There, a snowman as well as tombstones of Dirty Dan and Pinhead Larry are shown.]
SpongeBob: The first item on Mr. Krabs' list is...hair from a yeti crab?
Sandy: Well, that hairy hermit dwells right here on this mountain top.
[Sandy parks her submarine near the opening of the yeti crab's cave. SpongeBob and Sandy exit the submarine and enter the cave. They find the yeti crab sound asleep on a rock.]
Sandy: [gasps] Look, there he is!
[SpongeBob and Sandy tip-toe quietly towards the yeti crab. Sandy sneaks over, takes out a pair of scissors, pulls the blanket back, and clips some of the hair off the yeti crab's butt.]
Sandy: [gives the hair to SpongeBob and whispers] He lives alone. He'll never know it's gone.
[Plankton, who is clinging on a stalactite, watches from above as SpongeBob and Sandy leave the cave.]
Plankton: Krabs puts yeti hair in the Krabby Patties? Ew! Why didn't I think of that?
[The yeti crab shivers and pulls the cover back before going back to sleep. Plankton lowers himself down and prepares to mow the hair off the yeti crab's head with his lawn mower. This, however, wakes up the yeti crab and he roars at Plankton. He shakes Plankton off and sees his head bald. Plankton gets up and sees the yeti crab's shadow looming over him.]
Plankton: Uh-oh! [gets bashed and flattened by the yeti crab's rolling pin] Ow! Uh, ah, ooh, ah, oh, hey!
[Plankton is completely flat like a piece of paper. The yeti crab then folds Plankton into a little paper hat to cover his bald spot.]
Plankton: Could've been worse. Could've been a ten gallon hat.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Sandy flying over seaweed and jellyfish float by.]
SpongeBob: The next item is milk from a giant fangtooth fish.
Sandy: [drives the submarine down the abyss] The deep ocean floor is the only place it inhabits. Keep an eye out.
[SpongeBob sticks his eye through the submarine's telescope and sees a giant green fangtooth fish in front of them.]
SpongeBob: I found it! [pulls his eye back through the telescope] But how do we milk it?
Sandy: We'll have to distract her first. Deploy kibble!
[Sandy flips the switch and pours food down for the fangtooth fish to eat. The fangtooth fish kneels down and starts eating the food. SpongeBob and Sandy exit the submarine and rush over to the fangtooth fish's udder.]
SpongeBob: Is one udder better than another udder?
Sandy: We'll just have to milk them all! [gives SpongeBob a bucket]
[Sandy pulls up a stool, cracks her hands, and begins the milking process. Sandy milks some of the milk in the bucket and fills SpongeBob up with the milk. She pulls out a milking device and sticks it onto SpongeBob to spew the milk into the bucket. She pulls the device off of SpongeBob and puts it away.]
Sandy: Whoa, nelly! Good girl.
[The fangtooth fish moos like a cow and eats her food while SpongeBob and Sandy leave with the milk. Plankton, who was hiding behind some coral, giggles and flies over to the fangtooth fish's udder. He attempts to milk the milk out, but it wouldn't work since it was too big for him to pull.]
Plankton: Huh? Don't you run dry on me, baby! [punches the udder]
[Plankton's punching gets the fangtooth fish's attention.]
Plankton: [continues punching the udder] Come on! Flow already!
Female Fangtooth Fish: [sees Plankton] Huh? [growls]
Plankton: Uh, nice fishy-fishy. I—I don't suppose you like chumsicles. [pulls out a chumsicle and laughs nervously]
[The fangtooth fish swaps the chumsicle away and Plankton runs for his life. The fangtooth fish fires the milk from her udder and sprays it onto Plankton. Plankton takes out a bucket and gets some of the milk.]
Plankton: [giggles] Yeah! Thanks for the fish milk, Ugly! [laughs as he attempts to leave, but ends up getting swallowed by a orange male fangtooth fish]
Male Fangtooth Fish: You're not ugly, darling. You've got character.
Female Fangtooth Fish: Aww! [rubs the male fangtooth fish's chin and giggles]
Plankton: [shakes the bucket off while inside the male fangtooth fish's mouth] Oh, shrimp! Guess I'll have to take the long walk to the back exit. [goes down the male fangtooth fish's throat]]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Sandy flying the submarine to the Flying Dutchman's ghost ship.]
Sandy: SpongeBob, what are we doing here? The Flying Dutchman's about as welcoming as an outhouse breeze!
SpongeBob: It's on the list. [pulls out the list and points to the last item] See? Ghost dandruff.
[SpongeBob and Sandy hear the Flying Dutchman laughing. The scene goes to the Flying Dutchman looking at himself in the mirror.]
Flying Dutchman: [laughing] With my face, I can say anything and make it sound scary! [makes a scary face in the mirror and laughs] One large skinny pumpkin latte with soy milk, please? [laughs and forms a chainsaw on his face]
[SpongeBob and Sandy sneak into the Dutchman's ship through an open window. Sandy throws a lasso and ties it up to the ceiling. SpongeBob and Sandy climb up while the Flying Dutchman continues to admire himself in the mirror.]
Flying Dutchman: [forms a more hideous face] Forty percent chance of rain tonight as we head into the weekend. [shakes his head and laughs]
[SpongeBob and Sandy tip-toe quietly above the Flying Dutchman. They lower themselves down to where the Dutchman is having dandruff. Sandy brushes the dandruff into SpongeBob's bucket with her tail.]
SpongeBob: [whispers] Got it!
[SpongeBob and Sandy quickly climb back up and quietly leave. Plankton sneaks into through the hole on the floor. He throws the grappling hook and climbs up the Dutchman's back. He takes out a little vacuum and goes to suck the dandruff. But the vacuum accidentally sucks up the Dutchman's hair and it pulls really hard, causing the Flying Dutchman to feel pain.]
Flying Dutchman: Ah! Ow! Uh! What the?! [sees Plankton and grabs him] How dare you steal my dandruff! I've been drying me scalp for centuries in order to achieve the perfect dermatitis flakes! [points to his scalp with dry flakes on it]
Plankton: [hold up dandruff shampoo] Maybe some skull and shoulders would help?
[The Flying Dutchman growls angrily and blasts Plankton out of his ship with his powers. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Sandy flying over Jellyfish Fields with all of the items they've obtained from the list. Sandy is brushing the dandruff off her tail.]
SpongeBob: Well, we got everything on the list. [pulls up the bag of ingredients and spins the seat] Oh, Mr. Krabs will be so proud of me!
Sandy: I hope so, because that's the craziest group of ingredients I ever—Whoa!
[Suddenly, the alarm blares and the submarine shakes. It appears that Plankton is having the Chum Bucket plunge SpongeBob and Sandy out of the submarine. Plankton pops out.]
Plankton: There is one more thing I needed to get on my shopping list. Everything! [cackles] Thanks for doing it for me! So long, chumps!
[The Chum Bucket flings SpongeBob and Sandy away, grabs the submarine, takes it inside and pulls out the bag of ingredients.]
Plankton: [laughs evilly] At last! The Krabby Patty secret ingredients are in my hands!
[SpongeBob and Sandy land in a bush.]
SpongeBob: Aw, my ingredients!
Sandy: [cries] My submarine!
Yeti Crab: [appears next to them and growls] My hair!
[SpongeBob and Sandy scream in terror.]
French Narrator: Later…
[The scene changes back to the Krusty Krab. The yeti crab walks to the restaurant with a brown wig. He lets SpongeBob and Sandy off his back.]
Yeti Crab: Thanks for the wig.
Sandy: No problem! [sighs as she sees her tail completely shaved off] It'll grow back.
[The yeti crab turns and leaves.]
SpongeBob: And you even had enough to cover his buns. [points to the yeti crab's butt all covered up with Sandy's fur]
[Mr. Krabs is bathing in a tub of money in the restaurant. SpongeBob and Sandy enter the restaurant and sulk over to Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs gasps and hides in the tub] I got all the secret ingredients on your list, but Plankton stole them all! I made the apocalypse!
[SpongeBob cries a fountain of tears and spray them all over the restaurant, which hits Mr. Krabs. Sandy gets drenched on by the tears and activates the windshield wipers on her helmet.]
Mr. Krabs: [plugs SpongeBob's mouth with a cork] Now, now, son. You didn't make the apocalypse. I couldn't afford to have Plankton following me while I was getting the real ingredients at the Barg'N-Mart, could I?
[Mr. Krabs pushes the button on the table Fred is eating on and it flips over showing a shopping cart containing the real Krabby Patty ingredients.]
Fred: [screams] My leg!
SpongeBob: So, my list was a fake? So, no apocalypse?
Mr. Krabs: No apocalypse.
SpongeBob: I saved the world! [laughs and dances around the restaurant while Sandy glares angrily at Mr. Krabs] No apocalypse! No apocalypse! No apocalypse! No apocalypse!
Mr. Krabs: Let's not go too far.
Sandy: [rolls up her sleeves] You mean you sent my best friend on a dangerous wild goose chase just so you could go shopping?! [backs Mr. Krabs into his office] Excuse us, SpongeBob. [closes the door while wearing her karate glove] This is for my tail!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, Sandy, I was—
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops Mr. Krabs really hard] This is for almost getting us killed!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, Sandy!
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops Mr. Krabs really hard again and comes out with a bag of money] And this is for my submarine, Matilda!
[Mr. Krabs come out and is completely beaten up.]
Sandy: [kicks the plank Mr. Krabs is standing on] Hi-yah! Hi-yah! [karate chops Mr. Krabs and sends him flying through the roof]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I guess I had that coming.
[Meanwhile, at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is fixing up a batch of Krabby Patties with the fake ingredients.]
Plankton: Can you believe it, Karen? After all these years, the secret ingredients are finally here! And the final ingredient: [pulls out a bucket of ghost dandruff from the bag] ghost dandruff!
Karen: [backs away] I wouldn't add that last one.
Plankton: [adds ghost dandruff to the batch] Ha, ha! I can't wait to see the look on Krabs' face!
[Plankton stirs the fake ingredients all together. Then all of a sudden, the Chum Bucket explodes and sends Plankton flying in the sky.]
Plankton: [screams until he sees Mr. Krabs] Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton.


[The episode begins at Mr. Krabs' house. A boat drives up to the curb where a handsome narwhal named Dylan is dropping Pearl off.]
Pearl: Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan. [blinks her eyelids]
Dylan: No problem, Pearl. You still going for that party tonight? [waves his hair]
Pearl: [gasps] Oh-ho! You bet! [melts herself out of the boat]
Dylan: Nautical. [clicks his tongue] I'll pick ya up at eight. [drives away]
[Pearl is incredibly head of heels with her new boyfriend. She sighs and gently floats to the door, leaving a trail of dust that forms the word, "Swoon". Pearl's floating crashes through the front door and floats over to Mr. Krabs. She stops floating when she wakes up from her daydreaming.]
Mr. Krabs: Again? Come on, Pearly-girl, we're running low on doors here! [picks out a door from the closet and pastes it to the front door]
Pearl: Oh, I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm just so excited about going to the big party tonight!  I—I—I just had to...
Mr. Krabs: [cuts Pearl off] Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Sorry, sweetie. [puts on his hat] Daddy's going out to play cards with the boys tonight. [his teeth is full of cards, his spits them out, and puts them in his sleeve]
Pearl: But, but Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: No buts! I can't be worrying about you all night, honey.
Pearl: [begins to tear up] But, Daddy, I just want to go to the party! [her eyes fill up with tears]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, shrimp.
[Mr. Krabs takes cover and Pearl cries a huge fountain of tears.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa!
[Pearl's tears destroyed everything it touched. The tears destroy a plant and a picture on the shelf. The tears destroy the picture of Grandpa Redbeard, a grandfather clock and Mr. Krabs' first dollar. The grandfather clock coo-coos three times. Mr. Krabs hiding under a footrest. But Pearl's tears destroy it. Mr. Krabs cowers himself from the tears.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew. [his pants rip off] Hmm? [sees his butt showing] Ahh! [covers his ripped pants with tape] There, there, me little beluga. It'll be okay. I hired Mr. Squidward to babysit just like when you were little.
[Pictures of Squidward babysitting Pearl are shown. The first one shows Squidward pushing baby Pearl in her cradle. The second one shows baby Pearl crying while flooding the house and Squidward swimming for his life. And the third one shows Squidward holding baby Pearl in his lap.]
Pearl: Ew, Dad! Squidward is so lame.
Mr. Krabs: Lame, schmame. You and Squidward will have so much fun, you won't want to go anywhere. But just in case. [pushes the button and barricades the doors and windows with prison bars] You won't be able to go anywhere! [cackles until he hears a knock at the door] Oh, just in time.
[Squidward is knocking on the door with a confident smile. He looks at the door and wonders why it's barricaded. Just then, Mr. Krabs answers the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Thanks for keeping an eye on me little Pearl tonight.
Squidward: No problem.
Mr. Krabs: Remember our deal, Squidward. Keep Pearl out of trouble and I'll give you one shift a week without SpongeBob. But if anything happens to my little angel, I won’t give any shifts without SpongeBob...
[Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob out from his pocket. SpongeBob laughs and makes crazy, but creepy faces at Squidward.]
Squidward: No! Please! Anything but that! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs puts SpongeBob back in his pocket] You can count on me.
Mr. Krabs: I knew I could. [gets into his boat and drives away]
Squidward: Whew!
Pearl: Oh, thanks for watching the house tonight, Squidward. I'll be back late. So, you know, don't wait up for [gets snagged by a fishing hook] me!
Squidward: [grunts as he struggles to reel Pearl back] Your dad said we have to stay in tonight! [grunts] But that doesn't mean we can't have [grunts] fun!
[Pearl flops around like a fish and Squidward drags her back in the house. The scene changes to Squidward and Pearl sitting at a table together.]
Squidward: [digs through his backpack] Look. [takes out a whale-shaped doll] We can play with this setaceous Sally doll. [takes out crayons and a coloring book] Or we could color this princess coloring book. [holds up a tape cassette] Or we could sing along with—Ahh!
[Squidward notices that Pearl is gone and sees the ripped up doll on the floor.]
Squidward: Uh, Sally!
[Squidward goes to look for Pearl and sees the coloring book and crayons on the floor.]
Squidward: [picks up the book, looks in it, and screams] Outside the lines! [drops the book]
[Squidward rushes upstairs and goes to Pearl's bedroom door.]
Squidward: [knocks on the door] Pearl? [peaks in] Hello? [goes in her room and sees Pearl ripped wall paper and posters as if she is secretly making piñatas] Hmm, hey, uh, Pearl. Um, whatcha' up to?
Pearl: Arts and crafts!
Squidward: Hey, I dabble in the arts myself. Maybe I can help.
[Pearl turns one of her crafts around and reveals the words "R.I.P Squidward" with skull and cross bones.]
Squidward: [freaks out] Uh, never mind. Uh, you seem to have that under control. I'll just, um, be out here if you need me. Or not. Definitely not. [leaves Pearl's room and sits on a chair] That is one morbid teen.
Pearl: That outta keep him out of my hair.
[Pearl hears a horn honking outside the house. She opens the curtains and sees Dylan parked outside waiting for her. Dylan picks his teeth with a toothpick and looks at his watch. Dylan honks the horn again.]
Pearl: It's go-time!
[Pearl takes out her little mirror and takes a look from outside her room. She sees Squidward sound asleep near the door. She goes to put her craft-shaped head on the bed to fool Squidward. She lifts her Boys Who Cry poster, drills a hole through the wall with her tears and sneaks into the wall. She climbs down through the wall and comes out from below the house. She accidentally slams the house really hard and wakes up Squidward.]
Squidward: [screams] Oh. [gets up] What's happening? [opens her bedroom door] Pearl? Oh. You asleep? Aw, she must've tuckered herself out.
[Squidward taps on the Pearl's head-shaped craft and it slides off the bed.]
Squidward: [screams] Oh, no! Maybe if we get it on ice, then can reattach it—[backs into the wall where Pearl made the home to escape] Ahh!
[Squidward falls through the wall of the house and landed near the bottom of the front door. He digs himself underneath and comes out of the ground with the craft on his head. He pokes his eyes and mouth through the craft when he sees Pearl about to drive away with Dylan.]
Squidward: Huh?
Pearl: Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan.
Dylan: No prob.
[Dylan drives away with Pearl. Squidward breaks free from the ground and clutches his head.]
Squidward: She's gone! Krabs is gonna kill me!
[Squidward rushes to his recumbent bicycle. He pumps air in the back tire, puts on elbow pads and a helmet. He checks the tire and adds more air in it. He puts the air pump in the basket and hastily hops on the bike. He looks both ways and goes after Pearl. Meanwhile, Dylan is driving past a sign that says, "surface."]
Pearl: Um, that sign said "surface." Are you sure this is the way? [giggles]
Dylan: For sure, babe. We're going to a breach party.
Pearl: Oh, I've never been to one of those before. Sounds exciting.
[Dylan hits the accelerator and quickly drives the boat up a high cliff.]
Dylan: Whoo!
[Meanwhile, Squidward is riding his bike trying to look for Pearl.]
Squidward: Hmm. Mm-hmm. [stops and picks up some dirt] Hmm. Still warm. [sees the sign that says "surface"] The surface, eh? That SpongeBob-free shift will be mine! [He starts to go up the high cliff, but only gets a few hundred yards before his legs start to buckle. He slips back down but he doesn't dare let his bike reach the bottom. Groaning, he keeps biking up that vertical stretch of road] SpongeBob-shift—[grunts] mine!
[At the breach party near the surface, the party goers are having a great time. Some are watching television, eating pizza and drinking soda. Pearl, Dylan and other teenagers are roasting marshmallows over a hydrothermal vent. Pearl munches on the marshmallow on Dylan's narwhal tooth.]
Pearl: Mmm! Oh-ho, Dylan.
[Several teens are having a breaching contest by chugging down soda and jumping to the surface. One teen chugs down some of the soda.]
Teens: [chanting] Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
[The teen stops chugging and a bigger teen shakes him up to have him breach the surface.]
Teens: [chanting] Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach!
[The small teen floats to the surface and burps. Then he falls back down in the water.]
Teens: Whoo-hoo!
[Pearl, Dylan and the other teens dance to the music on the radio. Moments later, Squidward makes it up the cliff and his completely exhausted.]
Squidward: Pearl!
Teens: [stop dancing and gasp] Huh? What? [A goth girl raises an eyebrow and gives a withering look that would make Squidward look like an amateur]
Squidward: You have to come home right away! We can do whatever you want if we go back now! I'll even play us some jazz! [pulls out his clarinet] Kids love jazz!
[Squidward attempts to play music on his clarinet, but his lousy music makes Pearl, Dylan, and the party goers cringe.]
Squidward: ♪Come on, Pearl. Let's go home. I can't be here all alone.  Let's get back, before we're dead. [one teen covers his face with his hood and another hides in the beach umbrella] Skiddle-bobba-doo-diddle-bop-bop, yeah!♪
[Squidward's "jazzy" music creates agony to the teens.]
Teen #1: No! Jazz making me nerdier! [his face grows pimples, his arms grow smaller and his shirt changes from "cool" to "school"]
[One teen grows braces and his clothing turns into band clothes. Another teen's sunglasses becomes reading glasses. Pearl and Dylan cover their ears from Squidward's music.]
Pearl: Oh, this is so embarrassing!
Dylan: Forget him, Pearl. Let's breach.
[Dylan leads Pearl away from Squidward and goes to the breaching competition of the party. One teen breaches upward over the surface and comes back down into the water.]
Teens: Yeah! [gives high-fives to each other] Yeah! Yes! Yeah!
Pearl: Uh, I don't know. Is it dangerous?
Dylan: Uh-uh, babe. It's nautical. [waves his hair]
[Pearl gasps and giggles.]
Squidward: Pearl! What about yo-yos? Kids love yo-yos! [gets tangled up in the yo-yos]
Pearl: Okay, let's do it! One, two, three, [breaches up really high over the surface] yahoo! This is so coral! [falls and ends up beached on Bikini Atoll's shore; she gasps and flops around] Dylan, help! This isn't nautical!
[The teens see Pearl's feet dangling at the surface.]
Teen #2: Oh, man! She's beached!
Dylan: We're gonna be in so much trouble!
Teen #3: Leave her! Let's cheese it!
Teen #4: Let's get out of here!
[Dylan and the teens ditch Pearl and leave.]
Pearl: [continues to flop around] Oh, no!
Squidward: Pearl, are you alright?
Pearl: Oh, Squidward, I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you.
Squidward: It's okay! Let's just get you outta' here.
[Squidward grabs Pearl's feet and struggles to pull her back down. But he ends up pulling her shoes off and he goes flying backwards. He tries pulling her again, but ends up tearing his own arms off.]
Squidward: Okay, okay, just hold on a second! [runs off]
Pearl: Hold on? What are you—Ahh!
[Squidward plugs her blowhole with the air pump. He pumps air through Pearl's blowhole, making her inflate like a balloon. Pearl floats up high in the air. Squidward pulls the air pump out of Pearl's blowhole.]
Pearl: Huh?
[Pearl flies around all over the sky until she runs out of air. She falls back down into the water and lands gently into Squidward's bike. The party is completely trashed and all of the party goers including Dylan are gone.]
Pearl: [tears up and cries] I can't believe Dylan ditched me! My life is over!
Squidward: Oh, I don't think it's that bad.
[Pearl violently cries a fountain of tears. The tears rip of some of the leave of Bikini Atolls palm trees, scaring several seagulls in the process. Squidward cowers himself in fear.]
Squidward: I'll, um, just get you home.
[Squidward struggles to paddle his bike to bring Pearl home.]
French Narrator: Many, many minutes later...
[Squidward manages to bring Pearl home after a really long and exhausting ride. The bike's tires break into pieces and Pearl gets off to go in the house.]
Pearl: [sighs] Guess I'll just wait for my dad to get home.
Squidward: You know, there is a way we can still have a little fun tonight.
Pearl: Really?
[The scene changes to Pearl and Squidward running up to Dylan's house with a bag. Pearl rings the doorbell and she and Squidward hide behind Dylan's boat.]
Dylan: [answers the door] Like, hello?
[Dylan sees the bag and picks it up. He goes to look in the bag. When suddenly, the bag explodes, revealing SpongeBob inside. SpongeBob laughs and makes the same crazy and creepy faces from before. Dylan screams in horror and runs away. SpongeBob then chases after Dylan. Squidward and Pearl both laugh now that their revenge against Dylan is final, thus ending the episode.]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob making a Krusty Krab delivery. He rides his unicycle to a local company building and parks it at the parking rack.]
SpongeBob: Delivery! [gets caught in the spinning doors] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! [screams as he is sent flying into the security guard's desk; he gets up and he's dizzy] Delivery. [pops out his eye]
Security Guard: Will you ever learn how to use those doors?
SpongeBob: Never!
[SpongeBob gets up, puts his eye back in his face, and walks over to the elevator. He goes up the elevator and exits it. He enters the office and tries to find which one of the workers ordered the delivery.]
Boss: [comes out from her office] Has anybody seen my delivery? [goes back in]
SpongeBob: Delivery coming!
[SpongeBob takes off his shoe, pulls out a pogo stick and pogoes over the workers. He pogoes onto a worker's keyboard.]
Worker #1: Wow!
[SpongeBob pogoes on another worker's keyboard.]
Nathaniel: Hey!
[SpongeBob pogoes on a worker's head and pogoes over to a skeleton of Davy Jones.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I've heard of this. Davy Jones' cubicle.
[SpongeBob pogoes into the boss's office wall and enters through the door.]
SpongeBob: Your delivery, ma'am. [the bag slips out of his hand] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! [gibbers] Whoa! [gibbers]
[SpongeBob struggles to grab the bag before it falls to the ground. He gets himself tied up in a knot with his arms, but manages to catch the bag with his foot.]
SpongeBob: Whew!
[Suddenly, the bag rips. A Krabby Patty and a milkshake splatter all over the floor.]
SpongeBob: [groans] Oh, no! A delicious Krusty Krab disaster! [goes to scoop the milkshake back in the cup] Call the shore patrol! Get an ambulance! Does anyone know CSR? Chocolate shake resuscitation? [rolls himself over the milkshake stain and gets himself covered with it; he wrings the milkshake into the cup]
Boss: It's alright. Just leave it. [resumes her work]
SpongeBob: [sips the milkshake with a stray from the floor] Here! You can drink it from here! See? [drinks really hard until his sucks the straw into his face; he pulls it off] It's too late. I did all I could, but it wasn't enough. I'll just clean up the remains.
[SpongeBob grabs the boss's files and whips the milkshake stain with them.]
Boss: Enough! Just go. I'm busy.
SpongeBob: In ancient times, one would fall under sword by way of apology. We at the Krusty Krab keep that tradition. [pulls out his spatula, pretends to commit seppuku and falls flat; the boss couldn't care less and SpongeBob gets up] And now that that's out of the way, I am going to give you the Krusty Krab Customer Service Pledge of Satisfaction. [holds up the pledge of satisfaction paper] I pledge to come back here tonight and clean this carpet and make it shine! [opens the doors] As a matter of fact, I'll clean all your offices and all your cubicles. Courtesy of the Krusty Krab. [leaves]
Boss: No need. We have a cleaning robot that does it all at night.
[The scene changes to nighttime. The building is now closed and the security guard prepares to leave for the night.]
Security Guard: [talking through his cellphone] No, Mom. I'm not double-checking that the doors are locked. Stop nagging me. [his phone chatters and he sighs] I love you too. [leaves]
[SpongeBob comes strolling to the building with a cleaning cart. And Patrick is accompanying him for his assistance in completing the task.]
SpongeBob: Thanks for lending me your cleaning cart, Patrick.
Patrick: [gnawing on a broom] Cleaning cart? I thought this was a food cart.
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter, but get caught in the spinning door.]
Both: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Patrick: Best door ever!
[SpongeBob and Patrick fly out from the spinning doors.]
SpongeBob: Hold on!
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the elevator. But a gum wrapper falls onto the floor. The trash robot the boss mentioned about earlier picks up the wrapper.]
Trash robot: Trash. [burns the wrapper and leaves]
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the elevator.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
Patrick: Don't hit anything!
SpongeBob: Look out! Look out!
Patrick: Oh-ho, watch it!
SpongeBob: Look out! Look out!
Patrick: [screams] Paper shredder!
[SpongeBob and Patrick crash into the Shredinator 3000 paper shredder and little pieces of shredded paper fly everywhere.]
Patrick: [gleefully laughs and sticks his tongue out like his catching snowflakes] Those two shreds are alike.
SpongeBob: [covered in shredded paper and looks like a snowman] Let's start here and make our way to the milkshake stain.
[The scene changes to Patrick breaking a watercooler and filling a bucket up with water. He goes into a cubicle and throws water on the computer. The computer sparks. Patrick takes a mop and mops up everything.]
Patrick: [sings while he mops] ♪Working guy, working guy, working guy, working guy.♪
[SpongeBob goes into a stockholder office and uses the blower to blow several papers. He blows the chairs away from the table and blows them out the window. Patrick is scrubbing the ceiling with the floor scrubber. But some of the tiles fall over and crash on the floor. One tile hits a worker, who is working late in his cubicle. He puts a tiny umbrella on his head. The trash robot comes in through the elevator and sees the mess SpongeBob and Patrick made.]
Trash robot: Trash! [examines the big mess] Trash. [picks up the shred with its arms and eats them] Trash. [picks up all of the papers, forms into a ball, eats them, and rolls off] Trash!
[SpongeBob is vacuuming the particles from the floor. Patrick is goofing around, laughing and running all over the place. The vacuum puffs up dust and Patrick fills in pants with it. He floats up and down and goes back to running. He accidentally bumps into a cubicle, which resulted in knocking all of them over like dominoes. One wall falls on the worker.]
Patrick: Can I just say, "Oops?"
SpongeBob: Uh, not a problem. Uh, we'll just put 'em all back up the way they were.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick putting all of the cubicle walls back up.]
SpongeBob: There. Good as new.
[The scene pans out and reveals that SpongeBob and Patrick end up making a maze instead of making them separate cubicles.]
Patrick: Uh, how do we get out of here?
SpongeBob: Uh, maybe this way? [he and Patrick walk to the left, but end up going back to where they started] Oh, uh, or this way.
[The scene shows them digitalized as video game characters and resembles it into a maze game of Pac-Man. SpongeBob and Patrick go into different directions, while the trash robot tracks them.]
SpongeBob: [sees a candy wrapper on the floor] Oh! Missed one.
Trash robot: [grabs the wrapper] Trash!
SpongeBob: Hey, that's mine! I'm cleaning these offices! [snatches the wrapper from the trash robot] Patrick, catch! [throws the wrapper to Patrick]
[Patrick jumps up and eats the wrapper. But he falls onto a desk. The trash robot scans Patrick and finds the wrapper in his stomach.]
Trash robot: Trash! [blazes fire and holds out a sharp blade]
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: Run!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run from the trash robot. The trash robot chases them in hot pursuit. SpongeBob and Patrick climb over a wall. The trash robot slices through it with the blade. SpongeBob and Patrick take cover in the copy room. SpongeBob slips on some papers and crashes into the copier. Patrick goes to pull SpongeBob out, but the trash robot slices through the door. Patrick pulls SpongeBob out and they both run out. The trash robot puts a bandage on the copier.]
Trash robot: Boo-boo.
[The trash robot flares up and chases SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick run down the hall and hide into the kitchen. Patrick crashes into the soda machine and SpongeBob crashes into the coffee maker. SpongeBob removes the coffee pot from his head and gets coffee all over himself.]
SpongeBob: Oh no! I'm bleeding! [licks the coffee] It's okay. It's decaf.
[Patrick groans in pain as he slides off the soda machine.]
Trash robot: Trash, trash, trash.
Patrick: SpongeBob, why is this happening?
Trash robot: [comes in the kitchen] Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash. [scans everything in the kitchen and detects SpongeBob and Patrick as trash] Trash. [SpongeBob and Patrick grin nervously; the trash robot blazes fire over its head] Trash!
SpongeBob: Um, eh. Look you, garbage can thing. I don't know what we did to you, but I made a Krusty Krab pledge to your boss to clean these offices.
[The trash robot wouldn't listen to SpongeBob's pleas and shoots a broom in his mouth. It grabs Patrick and goes to burn him.]
Patrick: Ow! My rump is roasting!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick may be trashy, [Patrick burps] but he's not trash!
[SpongeBob leaps onto the trash robot and fights with it. The trash robot lets Patrick go and flings him into the sink.]
SpongeBob: Ah! Ah! Whoa! Stop that! Whoa! Oh!
[Patrick's butt is cooled off. Patrick takes a spoon and drinks some of the dishwater.]
Patrick: Hmm, Patrick soup.
SpongeBob: Ah! Ah! Whoa! Stop that! Whoa! Oh!
[The trash robot grabs SpongeBob goes to attack him. But SpongeBob retaliates by jumping on its back and make it spit out fire. The trash robot spins rapidly around and hits SpongeBob against the wall several times. They crash into the broom closet where SpongeBob ties up the trash robot.]
SpongeBob: Sorry to do this, but you'll have to stay here until we finish cleaning. [picks up a paper] Here. This should tie you over 'till we're done. [feeds the trash robot the paper]
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the main office.]
SpongeBob: Whew, finally! Patrick, meet the main stain that I disdain.
Patrick: Ha, ha, ha!
SpongeBob: [picks up a cleaner] Oh, what do you know? This cleaner contains saliva enzymes that break down chocolate particles. Hmm. You know if we wanted to, we could just—
[Patrick is licking the stain off the floor with his tongue.]
Patrick: Way ahead of ya!
SpongeBob: Make room!
[SpongeBob joins Patrick in licking the stain off the floor with their tongues. They hear a loud thud, but resume the task. The trash robot breaks free from the broom closet, fixes the copier, and takes control of it.]
Trash robot: Eliminate intruders!
[The copier operates itself and hops away from the outlet. The trash robot then takes control of the coffeemaker, the microwave oven, the pencil sharpener, the paper shredder and and the soda machine. Together, all of the machines march out to destroy SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob continue to lick the stain off the floor, until a drop of coffee falls on his head.]
SpongeBob: Ew. Patrick, stop sweating on me.
Patrick: I ran out of sweat an hour ago. [his dried tongue breaks off]
[Another drop of coffee falls on SpongeBob. They look up and see the coffeemaker dangling on the ceiling with its cord.]
Both: Ahh! Coffee killer!
[The coffeemaker falls from the ceiling and SpongeBob and Patrick run out. A shadow looms in from behind them. They turn and see the trash robot.]
SpongeBob: You again?
[A soda machine rolls next to the trash robot.]
Patrick: Oh, good! Soda! I was getting thirsty again.
[The soda machine shoots soda into Patrick's mouth. The soda machine then shoots various sodas at SpongeBob and Patrick. They both dodge the incoming sodas like dodging bullets.]
SpongeBob: This is not refreshing! [gets soda flung in his eyes and the soda sprays out, making him fall backwards]
[Patrick picks up a soda, shakes it, opens it, and throws it like a bomb. The soda explodes and sends the soda machine crashing into a wall. The wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. The trash robot snaps its fingers. SpongeBob gets grabbed by the copier and closes its lid several times. The copier then copies SpongeBob onto various papers.]
Patrick: Man, you do not take a bad picture! [shows a crude picture of SpongeBob made by the copier]
[The copier spits out SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[SpongeBob flies into the paper shredder and gets shredded up. Patrick opens the shredder and pulls SpongeBob out.]
Patrick: Hang in there, buddy! Hang in there! [grabs a bottle of glue and makes an nearly successful attempt to glue SpongeBob together]
[Patrick goes somewhere and SpongeBob fixes himself up. Patrick comes back with a tank.]
Patrick: [comes out from the hatch] Hey!
SpongeBob: Hey, where'd you get the tank, Patrick?
Patrick: It's what this company makes. Tanks.
[SpongeBob looks and sees tank-themed advertisements, tank posters, a tank sculpture, a first place trophy in in tanks, and even a tank mobile, behind his back.]
SpongeBob: How did I not notice that? [grabs the cleaning products] We'll use these as ammunition! [stuffs the tank with the cleaning products]
[The trash robot and his machine army search for SpongeBob and Patrick. They stop and see SpongeBob riding a tank.]
Trash robot: Retreat! Retreat!
[SpongeBob and Patrick fire the tank. They shoot a plunger on the copier. The copier crashes into the wall. The wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. The fourth, third and second floor of the building crash down onto one another. The paper shredder tries to escape, but SpongeBob and Patrick fire the tank at it with the plunger. The paper shredder crashes into another wall. The wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. The upper floors then crash down onto the first floor. The trash robot emerges from the rubble and is completely wrecked up. It bumps into the tank and becomes afraid, thinking that SpongeBob and Patrick are going to hurt it.]
Patrick: [comes out from the hatch] Hello!
[The trash robot surrenders the war and waves a little white flag. The trash robot goes to leave.]
SpongeBob: Hey, trash bot! [throws a chunk of the building to the trash robot and it eats it]
Trash robot: Yummy, trash.
[The last wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. Now, the entire building is completely destroyed. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick finally cleaning the stain off the floor of the main office right before dawn.]
SpongeBob: SpongeBob SquarePants always keeps his word. That carpet is clean.
Patrick: And I helped!
SpongeBob: You sure did, buddy! Come on, pal. Let's go get us a snack.
Patrick: Oh, I like that sound, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob and Patrick leave the building as it now stands in ruin. Meanwhile, the worker, who was not aware of the destruction, gets up from his chair, stretches and prepares to leave. However, he falls downward. The security guard enters the ruins of the building and catches the worker. He sees the place completely destroyed and drops the worker.]
Security Guard: I quit.

 
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Stop, thief! Come back here with me formula!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are chasing Plankton with the secret formula all over the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: He's over there! Stop him!
Plankton: [laughs] I can't help it. I'm a kleptomaniac!
[Mr. Krabs nearly catches him, but Plankton dodges him. Plankton keeps running away with the formula until he bumps into someone.]
Plankton: [laughs] Ow!
[Plankton pulls himself off, accidentally losing his eyeball and teeth. He puts his eyeball back in his face, looks up and sees a female police officer.]
Police Officer: You're under arrest!
Plankton: [puts his teeth back in his mouth] But I'm innocent!
Police Officer: No one is innocent! [cuffs up Plankton]
Plankton: Whoa. Things got dark fast.
Mr. Krabs: [giggles] ♪You're going to jail! You're going to jail!♪ Join in the dancing, boy, or you're fired. [SpongeBob joins in the dancing] ♪You're going to jail! You're going to jail! You're going to jail! You're going to jail!♪ [pokes Plankton]
Police Officer: Step back, buddy! Let the law handle this. [whacks Mr. Krabs' head with her club, inadvertently causing him to drop the secret formula]
Mr. Krabs: [dizzy] Yes, officer.
Police Officer: [takes the formula before Plankton can get it] And I'll be taking this!
Mr. Krabs: Wait! That's me secret formula!
Police Officer: [whacks Mr. Krabs' head with her club again] Well, now it's evidence. [picks up Plankton as he tries to get the formula] Oh.
Plankton: [gets whacked in the head by the officer] Ow!
[The police officer leaves the restaurant with Plankton and the secret formula.]
SpongeBob: The formula! I can't cook without that formula! [hyperventilates] I can't don't anything without it! The Krabby Patties are gonna taste like ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chum!
[The customers grumble and leave the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Don't go! We still have fresh buns. And we have air conditioning. Ohh... Come here! You and me are getting into that police department to get that formula back!
SpongeBob: How?
[Mr. Krabs puts on a police officer outfit.]
Mr. Krabs: By dressing like the po-po.
SpongeBob: The po-po? Oh, no, no.
Mr. Krabs: [removes SpongeBob's hat with the club] No, no po-po—no job-o for you-o. Comprendo?
SpongeBob: So-so. [gulps] But I'll go-go.
[Meanwhile, at the Bikini Bottom Police Department, Plankton is randomly getting pictures taken.]
Police Officer: Turn to your left. [takes picture and shows a mug]
Plankton: What is this?
Police Officer: Mug shot.
Plankton: [scoffs] Looks nothing like me. [gets drenched by the mug's coffee]
[The scene changes to the officer letting Plankton into his cell.]
Police Officer: [slams the door] Low life.
Plankton: You'd live a low life too, officer, if you were my height! [sighs and goes to sleep in his bed; he goes to tuck himself in, but sees that his blanket is a postage stamp] Could have given me a bigger blanket!
[The police officer put on donut-earmuffs so she wouldn't hear Plankton's complaining. Patrick comes in all covered in ice cream and looking drunk. Patrick kicks the camera stand and falls.]
Police Officer: One too many Goofy Goobers again, eh, Patrick?
Patrick: [gets up and groans] No, sir, I couldn't eat another.
[Patrick drunkenly stumbles over to Plankton's cell.]
Police Officer: Get in there and sleep it off.
[Patrick pulls the key out from his belly button and enters the cell. Patrick walks over to the toilet, runs over to Plankton and falls onto the bed to sleep. He turns his body over, revealing Plankton in his butt area.]
Plankton: Not exactly the blanket I wanted.
[Meanwhile in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are wondering around the streets in their police uniforms.]
SpongeBob: Isn't it a crime to impersonate a police officer?
Mr. Krabs: We're not impersonating, boy-o. I was in the navy, and the navy is sort of like the cops...of the sea. And I just deputized you. [whacks SpongeBob with the club]
SpongeBob: Deput—wow! I always wanted to be an officer of the law! Check it out. [rubs his chin] I'm the fuzz. Ooh, look at this! [takes off his shoe and his foot is flat] I'm also a flat foot! [giggles] Watch me work. [runs over to a passing mime and blows the whistle] Mr. Mime, you have the right to remain silent. [giggles and runs over to an old man] Stop or I'll shoot...you a nasty look. [makes faces, blows a raspberry, and giggles]
[SpongeBob starts holding hands with Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [pulls his hand away] Hey, let go! Cops don't hold hands.
SpongeBob: Well...they should. [droops]
Mr. Krabs: Bring it in, Officer Little Buddy!
[SpongeBob gets excited and hugs Mr. Krabs. Just then, a crowd of people is watching them.]
Mr. Krabs: What? Cops can hug. You know, boy-o, we probably make some pretty good cops.
[SpongeBob notices a little girl selling cookies at her cookie stand. He begins to grow suspicious.]
SpongeBob: Hm? Ohh. What have we got here? Excuse me, miss. Have you got a license to sell these cookies?
Mr. Krabs: Officer SquarePants, I don't think we ought to—
SpongeBob: Let me handle this, Officer Mr. Krabs! Well, missy, do ya?
Helen the Felon: I don't have a license.
SpongeBob: [cuffs the little girl] Yeah, that's what I thought. You're under arrest for violating penal code 4968973025-D.
Mr. Krabs: How did you know that?
SpongeBob: That's classified.
[Back in the Bikini Bottom Police Department, Patrick is having a conversation with Plankton in their prison cell.]
Patrick: Oh, I love it here. We have owers, uh, a courtyard, and three square meals a day. [holds up a bucket of raw chum] All chum...Ahh.
Plankton: I know. They're my only customer.
Patrick: [laughs and runs to the toilet] This is the best part! [flushes the toilet and it sprits out a fountain of water; he laughs] Pretty cool, huh?
Plankton: If you attempt to use that in front of me, I'll annihilate you.
[Outside the police department, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs bring the little girl to the front door.]
SpongeBob: Central booking, also known as the cop shop. [opens the door and lets the little girl go in]
Mr. Krabs: How do you know all these words?
SpongeBob: Still classified. [enters the building and Mr. Krabs follows]
Officer John Slugfish: Well, if it isn't little Helen the Felon. [drinks some coffee] Good work, boys. You nabbed the most notorious criminal in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Huh? This sweet little thing?
Officer John Slugfish: You can drop the act now, Helen.
[Helen bites SpongeBob's hand and kick's Mr. Krabs in the stomach.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey!
Officer John Slugfish: [chuckles] That's my girl. All right, take her to the interrogation room.
[Helen the Felon is taken to the interrogation room and SpongeBob turns on the light.]
Mr. Krabs: While I look for the formula, you can interrogate the suspect.
SpongeBob: But I don't know how to interrogate.
Mr. Krabs: Then just ask questions. [pushes SpongeBob in the room] And act tough. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Um...questions and act tough. Got it. [goes to the table and pulls the chair] Hmm... [sits down] Okay, little Helen! [inhales and buffs up his body] What do you think of this weather?
Helen the Felon: I think it's wuh-vey! Let me ask you something. How long have you been an idiot?
[SpongeBob begins to get nervous and shrinks down to his normal size.]
SpongeBob: I want a lawyer.
Helen the Felon: Just answer the question!
[SpongeBob's body rips in half, revealing his brain. SpongeBob takes his brain back and becomes even more nervous than usual.]
SpongeBob: [whimpers] An idiot? I don't know! Is it hot in here? [breathes heavily and sweats] Pressure—I can't—okay, I'll confess! I'll confess to it all! Anything! Whatever you got!
[Back at Plankton's prison cell, Plankton is sawing his way out with the nail filer. Patrick sighs behind him.]
Plankton: That's it. Keep up that cacophony. Your noise is drowning out my filing. [chuckles]
Patrick: [groans] My stomach needs frozen treats.
Patrick's stomach: Frozen treats.
Patrick: [jumps off the bed] Huh! I'm gonna have to make myself some jailhouse ice cream. [puts a band on his hand]
[Patrick grabs a bunch of toilet paper and stuffs them down the toilet. He pulls his underwear out and stuffs it in the toilet too. He squirts a tube of toothpaste, adds a cinderblock, and stuffs them all down with his foot. He grabs a scooper, scoops some green ice cream out and puts it on a cone made out of magazine. He takes a taste and he likes it.]
Patrick: Try it! You can't even tell the difference.
[A close-up of the ice cream is shown.]
Plankton: Blech! No, thanks. But, say, I know where they keep the real ice cream around here: in the evidence room. A guy like you who knows his way around here might be able—
Patrick: [pops a key out from the ice cream] I have a key.
Plankton: Oh, really? Let's go!
[Patrick swallows the key, rubs the ice cream all over his body and slips through the bars. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is searching through the hallway for the evidence room. He stumbles across a room filled with donuts.]
Mr. Krabs: Donuts? [opens the door and a pile of donuts fall on him] Whoa! [pops out] Hm. Well...maybe just one. [eats one donut; he turns and sees the door to the evidence room and spits the donut out] Evidence room! [goes to the door] Huh? [hears something]
Patrick: You promised me ice cream! Hmph! [sits on the floor and pouts]
Plankton: [jumps on Patrick's stomach] Look, once I get the secret formula and rule the world, I'll buy you all the ice cream you want! [hops over to a shelf filled with various evidence] Let's see. Comic books, sea shells...an old man...
Old Man Jenkins: Hello!
Plankton: Outboard motors...stolen jokes...a leg...
Fred: [off-screen] My leg!
Plankton: Hmm? Well, drop a dime on me! There it is! [goes to get the formula, but Mr. Krabs takes it before it gets it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, you don't!
Plankton: Krabs? What are you doing here? I stole that formula fair and square!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm stealing it back! [stuffs the formula under his shirt]
Plankton: Oh, no, you not!
[Plankton throws a sea shell at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs removes the shell and falls over, knocking over boxes of evidence. He comes out, holding an old man.]
Old Man Jenkins: Hello!
[Mr. Krabs throws the old man at Plankton, squishing him in the wall.]
Old Man Jenkins: Hello!
[Plankton throws the old man back at Mr. Krabs, sending him flying into another shelf. A group of old people fall onto Mr. Krabs.]
Old people: Hello!
Mr. Krabs: Who's been pinching all these geezers?
Patrick: [grabs Mr. Krabs] Where's my ice cream? Where's my ice cream? Where—[hallucinates as he sees Mr. Krabs' eyestalks become two ice cream cones; he gasps] Ohh! Well, there it is. [licks Mr. Krabs' eyestalk]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, you maniac?! Help! Police! [screams as he runs]
[Plankton jumps onto Mr. Krabs and begins a brawl.]
Mr. Krabs: What do you think you're—
[Moments later, Officer John Slugfish comes in the evidence room, eating a donut. He sees Plankton, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick fighting.]
Officer John Slugfish: I don't know what you two are doing, but it looks illegal. [gets caught in the brawl, but manages to cuff them all up]
SpongeBob: [comes in wearing cuffs] I have a confession to make!
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob being placed in the same cell with Plankton and Helen the Felon.]
Officer John Slugfish: I'll just hold onto this formula till the morning. [shuts the cell door]
SpongeBob: Oh, but, officer, I have more confessions.
Officer John Slugfish: Zip it, kid! I get it. You're a criminal mastermind. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Guilty! Yay!
Plankton: Hey, where's Patrick?
[They see Patrick, covered in ice cream again, all drunk from Goofy Goobers and opens the cell door with the key. Patrick walks over to the toilet, runs over to Plankton, Helen the Felon, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob and falls onto the bed to sleep.]
SpongeBob: Well, I must confess, this is sure cozy.


[The episode begins at Sandy's treedome at night. Sandy is leading her Science Scouts on a very important mission.]
Sandy: All right, Science Scouts. One last check on supplies. We all need to be prepared for a campout on the moon. [points to SpongeBob] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [digs into his backpack and pulls out a pack of Fizz Bomb Cola] Six-pack of Fizz Bomb Cola. [pulls out a bubble wand] Bubble wand. [blows a bubble shaped like the Moon and pulls out a tank top] Mesh tank top. [purrs] And I'm waiting on a Krabby Patty delivery.
Sandy: Well, that's not what I had in mind when I said supplies. How 'bout you, Pearl?
Pearl: Oh. [digs in her bag and pulls out pom-poms] Pom-poms, [pulls out a megaphone and screams in SpongeBob's face] megaphone, and spirit! [jumps and shakes the treedome, knocking everyone over.]
Squidina: Uh. Do you always have to rub it in my face that you're a cheerleader?
Pearl: [rubs pom-poms on Squidina's face] Yes I do! [blows raspberry]
Sandy: Scouts, I don't think you cotton to what we're doin'. We're going to the moon!
[Bubble Bass shows his butt outside the treedome.]
SpongeBob, Pearl, &amp; Squidina: Eww!
Bubble Bass: Huh? [pulls up his pants] Mm! [scoffs and leaves]
Sandy: No, that moon. [points to the moon in the sky]
SpongeBob, Pearl, &amp; Squidina: Ohh!
Sandy: Squidina, what did you bring?
Squidina: [digs in her bag and pulls out a pair of glasses] Eyeglasses, [pulls out comic books] comic books, [pulls out action figures] and action figures.
Pearl: Ugh, can a person be any nerdier?
SpongeBob: I can. [holds up an ugly picture of himself]
Pearl: Ew!
Sandy: Remember, Scouts, we're scientists. Let's behave like it.
[SpongeBob washes his tank top, hangs it on the clothes line and blows bubbles through the holes.]
SpongeBob: Science!
Sandy: [grumbles and opens the door] Everyone on board for lift-off.
[Squidina and Pearl enter the tree. Pearl's enormous head gets stuck in the door and Sandy pushes her in.]
Pearl: Ouch!
Sandy: Let's go, Scout!
SpongeBob: But I'm still waiting for my Krabby Patty delivery guy.
[Sandy takes out her telescope and looks through it. The moon moves directly to the right spot where the X is.]
Sandy: The moon is in perfect position for us to launch. [puts her telescope away] We gotta leave now! [grabs SpongeBob and drags him in her tree]
[Outside the treedome, someone is ringing the doorbell. It turns out to be Squidward, who was supposedly delivering a Krabby Patty to SpongeBob.]
Squidward: Hello? Delivery. [grumbles and enters the treedome] Did someone order a Krabby Patty? [walks over to the picnic table and leaves the delivery there; he picks one of Sandy's records and looks at it] Uhh. Yuck. Hokey hoo-ha for hicks. [the treedome starts to shake and Squidward starts to panic] Ahh! I take it back! I could learn to like songs about tractors...maybe.
[Sandy pushes some buttons on her control panel, which causes a shaking motion that scares her scouts.]
Sandy: Uh, sorry about that. Just some backfire is all.
SpongeBob: Safety first.
[Squidina and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. SpongeBob attempts to fasten his, but his seatbelt rolls back. He attempts to tie the seatbelt in a knot, but it unravels and slaps him in the face.]
SpongeBob: Uh, why you! [pulls his seatbelt up, but gets all tangled up in it]
Sandy: Uhh, everything okay back there, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob gives Sandy a thumbs up after getting tangled up by his seatbelt. The seatbelt untangles him and flips him in his helmet. Sandy pulls out a lasso and ties SpongeBob down.]
SpongeBob: Thanks!
Sandy: Three, two, one, launch! [pushes the lunch button and it flips over, revealing a sandwich, an apple, and a carton of milk] Whoops! Lunch. [pushes the launch button]
[The treedome begins shaking and is about to launch into space. Squidward runs to the door and attempts to leave, but the vibration makes him fall over. The treedome, now redesigned as a rocket ship, blasts off from the ground and starts flying. Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob's faces distort as the rocket launches upward. SpongeBob laughs and Squidward's face distorts as well. Squidward crawls over to the dome's glass and sees Bikini Bottom getting smaller below him. The rocket emerges from the ocean, exits the Earth's stratosphere, and directly heads into outer space. Squidward panics, screams, and runs around like crazy. But suddenly, he starts floating since there is no gravity in space.]
Squidward: Eh, did I die? Am I a ghost? [screams as he floats around]
Sandy: [turns off the rocket's engines] Okay, Scouts, you're free to move about the cabin.
SpongeBob: [starts floating] Ooh, whoa! I'm flying, I'm flying! [his skirt falls down, revealing his underwear] Whoop! [covers his underwear and laughs]
[SpongeBob's helmet falls off. Then SpongeBob's eyes, nose, and mouth fall off his body while he laughs.]
Sandy: [checking the peanut plant's pulse] This peanut plant's pulse is staying steady in zero G.
Pearl: I've never been so light before. [spins around uncontrollably, flies directly into some wires and gets zapped by them; she sighs and chuckles]
Sandy: Uhh, I gotta fix that.
Squidina: [playing with her action figures] Teenage Action Girl, rise to the rescue of Action Dog while Teenage Action Boy floats in the corner and mopes. [imitating] I don't care. Oh, no! Help me! [Pearl floats past Squidina, almost knocking her over] Hey! Watch it, you big orca!
Pearl: You watch it, you big dorka!
[Squidina blows a raspberry. Meanwhile in Sandy's treedome, the record playing begins playing country music. The tree's acorns. the running wheel, the Fixin' to Go Nuts record, and the picnic table are floating everywhere. Squidward is cowering in fear, completely unaware of the fact that he is in outer space.]
Squidward: There can only be one explanation. I've lost my mind! [starting to lose sanity] All those years working at the Krusty Krab and I finally snapped! [hits his head against the glass and floats down] Ohh, going crazy is actually a relief. [sighs] All my stress is gone. [spins an acorn on his tentacle; suddenly, the rocket is getting hit by asteroids and space junk outside; Squidward screams in panic] All my stress is back!
Sandy: Uh-oh, we've got space junk! [hops into her chair and begins pushing buttons on her control panel] Everybody, back in your seats. Trays in upright positions. Head between your knees. Your mama can't save you now!
[SpongeBob, Squidina, and Pearl sit back into their seats and fasten their seatbelts. The rocket continues flying through the asteroid belt despite getting hit by space junk. A bowling ball crashes into the window and Sandy hits it back outside with a bat.]
SpongeBob: [cheers with Squidina and Pearl] Home run! [whistles]
[Sandy closes the damaged window with a pair of trousers. The rocket safely makes it out of the asteroid belt.]
Sandy: We've still get a few Astro Belts to get through. Brace yourselves for the cold belt!
[The rocket flies directly into the cold belt, which is a ring of snowmen, igloos, freezers, and icebergs. Squidward floats around while frozen in a block of ice. SpongeBob is building a snowman version of Patrick Star and laughs. Pearl and Squidina hover themselves and shiver. Sandy is wearing a warm coat and holding a mug of hot chocolate. She looks out through the telescope.]
Sandy: Next up, we got a hot belt!
[The rocket flies directly into the hot belt, which is a ring of flaming asteroids and stoves. SpongeBob's Patrick-snowman melts from the hot belt's heat.]
SpongeBob: Patty melt. [chuckles]
[Sandy breathes heavily and fans herself with her tail; she goes to look through the telescope, but burns her hands]
Sandy: Ow! [blows her hands, looks through the telescope and sees the radiation belt up ahead] Huh! We're going through the radiation belt! That could cause mutations! Everyone, get under your lead blankets!
Pearl: [gasps] Mutations?! I must protect my beautiful face! [puts a lead blanket over her]
[SpongeBob pulls a lead blanket out from his bag and puts it over him. The rocket flies directly through the radiation belt. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob take cover under their lead blankets. SpongeBob sticks his hand out from under the blanket and his hand becomes mutated. SpongeBob laughs and his hand roars. His hand begins gnawing on his helmet.]
SpongeBob: Aww. [chuckles]
[Back in the treedome, Squidward begins to suffer from the effects of the radiation belt. The belt's effects mutates Squidward's body into different shapes.]
Squidward: Oh, good Neptune! I'm going through puberty again! [his body keeps changing shapes and he shrinks into a baby version of himself]
[The rocket makes it safely through the radiation belt and resumes flying to the moon.]
Sandy: Okay, Scouts, it's all safe now. [Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob uncover themselves; pulls down her telescope] Let's see where we are. [looks through] Craters, craters—[a giant eyeball appears] Oh! Giant eyeball? Now I'm as confused as a goat on Astroturf. [hears SpongeBob laughing outside] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [appears outside and looking through the telescope] Hey, there's a tiny little squirrel in here. [Sandy is angrily wagging her tail] How'd you get in there, you little fuzz ball?
Sandy: I love the guy, but if his brains were dynamite, he couldn't blow his nose.
[The rocket lands and makes a successful touchdown on the moon's surface. The rocket deploys its anchor so it won't float away. Back in the treedome, Squidward pops out from under the picnic table.]
Squidward: Huh? We've stopped. It's all over! I'm back home! [laughs as he runs to the front door; he exits the dome and begins walking, but he floats downward since there's no gravity; he then notices the planet Earth in front of him] Wait a minute. That's the Earth. And that down there is the moon? So, somehow the treedome flew here. [looks down] Good Neptune, I'm falling! Wait, if I remember my high school science, on the moon, I'm much lighter than on Earth. Which means...ha! This fall won't hurt me.
[But unfortunately for Squidward, as he lands on the moon and despite the zero gravity, he ends up getting crushed and smooshed into his helmet. He starts waddling around on the Moon's surface until he trips and falls into one of the moon's craters. He gets up and pulls himself together from the fall's impact.]
Squidward: [blubbers as he shakes his head] Oh, shrimp. Now where am I? Maybe this is the way out. [peaks through the tube and ends up in the desert; a vulture looks down and screeches at him; and pulls his head back from the tube; he runs over to another one] Maybe this one? [peaks through the second tube and ends up in the guitar of the cowboy squirrel]
Country squirrel: Are y'all ready to go nuts for some hokey hoo-ha?
[The crowd cheers. Squidward screams and pulls himself back from the tube.]
Squidward: [walks over to another tube] Third time's a charm? [peaks through the tube and ends up in Rodger Bumpass's storyboard drawing, he and Rodger scream at each other; he pulls himself back from the tube and runs off]
[Back on the moon's surface, Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina exit the rocket and make their first steps on the moon.]
Sandy: One small step for a squirrel...
SpongeBob: Ooh! [goes to exit the rocket, but trips; he falls on top of Pearl and Squidina and they crash into Sandy's pile of camp supplies] One giant leap for SpongeKind. [laughs]
[Sandy activates her camp supplies and all of the tents get set up for camp.]
Sandy: All right, Science Scouts, everyone's got an assignment. Pearl, you measure the moon's gravity.
Pearl: Rah, rah, sis, moon, bahhh! [floats upward]
Sandy: Squidina, you collect moon rocks.
Squidina: Way ahead of you, Ms. Scout Ma'am Cheeks! [throws a moon rock and starts looking for more]
Pearl: [emerges from underneath a large moon boulder] Grrr-avity!
[Squidina sighs and continues her search on more moon rocks.]
Sandy: SpongeBob, you can search for intelligent life.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye! Hmm...mmm...
Sandy: You do know how to recognize intelligent life, right?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure. [holds up a saw] I cut open their heads to see if they have any brains.
Sandy: [sighs, takes the saw, and gives SpongeBob a horn] If you find anything, just toot. [SpongeBob takes the horn and floats away with it] Now to study the moon's gravitational effects on my nuts. [walks over to her gravitational experiments and begins her tests]
[Squidina continues gathering moon rocks until Pearl rubs her pom-poms on her face.]
Pearl: I'm number one! You're number two! I'm gonna beat the nerd out of you!
Squidina: [huffs] No one beats the nerd out of Squidina! [throws a moon rock at Pearl]
Pearl: Whoa! [ducks from the incoming moon rock] Missed me! [laughs and blows a raspberry]
[Squidina's moon rock float around the moon and hits Pearl in the face.]
Squidina: Science! Yay!
[Meanwhile, Squidward runs out from the moon's crater and boards it shut. He pants from exhaustion, throws his hammer away, and looks at the Earth again.]
Squidward: Well, maybe being on the moon isn't so bad. After all, [takes out a tape measure and extends it] SpongeBob is over 238,000 miles away. [pauses and lets go of the tape measure]
Random citizen: [gets hit by the tape measure] Ow!
Squidward: [gasps] This moon is a no SpongeBob zone! [places a flag with a "No SpongeBob" sign on the moon's surface] Here, I'm the man on the moon! [his outburst creates a really loud echo; it was so loud that SpongeBob even heard it]
SpongeBob: [pulls out a plastic ear and sticks it on his helmet] Um, did someone say, "Man on the Moon?" [looks in the crater] Hello? [stands on a stalagmite] Intelligent life? [peaks out from the crater] How about average smarts? [his bottom sticks out from another crater] I'd settle for common sense! [sighs until he sees Squidward's footprints on the moon's surface] Ooh! Intelligent footprints. [follows the footprints and climbs over the cliff, where he sees the Krabby Patty delivery Squidward was supposed to deliver; he walks over to the bag and honks the horn] Huh? [honks the horn once more] Wha-hoo! [marches around while honking the horn] I found it! I found it!
Sandy: [pants as she arrived] What'd you find, SpaceBob?
SpongeBob: Intelligent life. [honks the horn and points to the bag]
Sandy: [digs into the bag] I'm not so sure about that. [pulls out a Krabby Patty] If they were intelligent, they would have eaten this Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Ooh! Mmm, speaking of eating [his stomach rumbles]
Sandy: You're right! It's lunch time. [puts the Krabby Patty back in the bag] Would you mind fetching the lunch I prepared?
SpongeBob: You bet! Just call me LunchBob.
[SpongeBob begins running in place while floating. Sandy pushes SpongeBob down to help him walk on the moon's surface.]
Sandy: Just press the button labeled "lunch!"
[Meanwhile, Squidward is skipping around on the moon's surface like an stupid idiot. He believes that SpongeBob doesn't exist on the moon and is completely unaware that he's already on it.]
Squidward: No SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no Sp—[stops at the dark side of the moon] Whoa! The dark side of the moon. [whimpers and peaks into it] SpongeBob? Are you in here? [pulls his head back out] No SpongeBob. [blubbers as he shakes his head] I have a strange feeling suddenly coming over me. Could it be...that I'm...happy? [stupidly walks into the dark side of the moon]
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is inside Sandy's rocket trying to figure out which button is the lunch button.]
SpongeBob: Lunch, lunch, where's lunch? Oh, there it is. [accidentally pushes the launch button and activates the rocket's engines]
Computer: Preparing to launch.
SpongeBob: No! [frantically pushes the launch button to stop] No, not launch! Lunch! [grabs a screwdriver and tries to pry the button off]
[The rocket reactivates itself and starts to fly away. The anchor hooks itself on the moon's crater and begins pulling the moon into a different direction.]
Pearl: Uh, wait, wait—what's going on? [falls over]
Squidina: [whimpers] How should I know? [falls over]
Sandy: You guys wait here! [climbs up the anchor's chain, enters the rocket and stops the engine] Phew! SpongeBob? [sees SpongeBob outside the rocket] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, Sandy! [chuckles] Hey, girl. I was just gonna run back home. I forgot, uh...my reading glasses. [sighs and pants while running in space]
[Sandy activates a lasso, grabs SpongeBob and drags him back into the rocket.]
Sandy: It's okay, SpongeBob. It's my fault for putting the launch and lunch button so close together. [looks at the monitor] Oh, no! The moon's been pulled out of its regular orbit. That could have disastrous effects on the Earth's tides.
[Back on Earth and without the moon in its regular orbit, the ocean's tides are lowered. Bikini Atoll has no water and the ocean level in Bikini Bottom is decreasing.]
Nat Peterson: Water's a little dry today.
[The Bikini Bottomites are doing all that they can to stay alive as long as they can from decreased ocean level.]
Sandy: And that last launch depleted our fuel.
Santa: [off-screen] Ho-ho-ho.
Sandy: That's weird.
[Back on the moon, Pearl and Squidina hover together.]
Squidina: [pants] I'm so sorry you're a cheerleader!
Pearl: I'm sorry you're a nerd!
Pearl &amp; Squidina: That came out wrong! [cries]
[SpongeBob and Sandy arrive back to Pearl and Squidina.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, moon hugs! Make room for me. [hugs Pearl and Squidina] Come on, Sandy, bring it on in. [pulls Sandy in]
Sandy: It's all right, Scouts. We just gotta figure out a way to get back to Earth.
Pearl: But Sandy, we heard strange laughing coming from...[points to the dark side of the moon] in there.
Santa: [off-screen] Ho-ho-ho.
[Squidward appears from the dark side of the moon while being held by a mysterious being.]
Pearl, Squidina, Sandy, &amp; SpongeBob: Huh? [gasps]
SpongeBob: Squidward? You're the man on the moon?
Squidward: SpongeBob?! [sighs in defeat] Of course. Why not?
[The mysterious being comes out from the dark side of the moon. The being turns out to be none other than the jolly old elf himself: Santa Claus. Santa drops Squidward down.]
Squidward: Ohh! [falls on the moon's surface and gets crushed and smooshed in his helmet again] Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Santa: [notices SpongeBob] SpongeBob? Ho-ho! I should've known you'd have something to do with this.
SpongeBob: Santy Claus! Well, Santa, you know the saying, where SpongeBob goes...
Santa: I know, trouble follows.
SpongeBob: I was gonna say laughter follows. [laughs]
Sandy: Mr. Claus, what are you doing on the dark side?
Santa: The dark side of the moon is the only place dark enough for me to get any sleep. [holds up a book and shows a picture of himself sleeping in his sleigh] I was sleeping like a baby—visions of sugar plums. [turns the page and shows picture of Squidward stumbling in Santa's sleigh] Then this bad boy goes and bangs into my sleigh and wakes me up!
Squidward: Well, I guess I'm getting nothing for Christmas...again.
Santa: [notices the Earth is far away] Holy night, SpongeBob! Did you shrink the Earth?
SpongeBob: [stammers nervously] Good question, Mr. Claus.
Sandy: We're actually further from the Earth now. We could have moved the moon back into its regular orbit if we hadn't run out of fuel. [looks angrily at SpongeBob as he whistles nervously]
Squidina: A controlled explosion might move the moon back.
Pearl: [blows her bubble gum and pops] Ha, you're so smart. How do we do that?
[SpongeBob strains himself as he thinks. He comes up with a really good idea and forms into a lightbulb. He takes out his pack of Fizz Bomb Cola.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! Fizz Bomb Cola! A burp explosion in every can.
[Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina grab a can of Fizz Bomb Cola. SpongeBob opens his can.]
Sandy: Yee-haw! That's my Science Scouts!
[SpongeBob, Pearl, Squidina, and Sandy open a hole in their helmets and start drinking their soda. The soda's chemicals build up in their stomachs. They all take off their helmets and make the loudest belch in order to move the moon back into place. But nothing happens, since the moon is too heavy to move from such force.]
Sandy: No go, the moon's too heavy. [belches and cover her mouth]
Santa: [laughs] I think some children might be needing some brains for Christmas. [chuckles]
[Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob came up with a different idea. They form a sail using their clothes in hopes of blowing the moon back into its orbit, leaving themselves in their underpants. They hoist the sail up with the mast.]
Squidina: Perfection!
SpongeBob: Now we just wait for a gust of wind.
[They wait for a gust of wind. But since there is no air in space, nothing happens.]
Sandy: Uh, interesting science fact: there's no atmosphere on the moon, therefore there's no wind.
[Santa laughs really hard which causes his belt buckle to fall off.]
SpongeBob: [dodges Santa's belt buckle] Why don't we just push the moon back?
[Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and Santa look strangely at SpongeBob. SpongeBob warms up and attempts to push the moon back with all his might. Squidina and Pearl attempt to do the same, but the moon is too heavy for them to move.]
Santa: [laughs] You all should be a sea monster because you're Kraken me up! Get it? Kraken? [laughs]
Sandy: [hops on his sleigh and grabs his beard] Santa Claus, you can do more than just say, "Ho-ho-ho!" at us! You can dig into that toy sack of yours and find something to help!
Santa: But I'm having such a jolly, holly time! [Sandy grumbles angrily at Santa] You're right. I'm being naughty, not nice.
[The scene changes back to Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Squidward, Squidina, and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. Santa peaks in the rocket through the window.]
Santa: Everyone nestled all snug?
Sandy: We're all snug, Santa. But why is SpongeBob with you?
SpongeBob: [sitting in Santa's sleigh] Yeah, why am I riding with you? Not that it isn't a pleasure.
Santa: I want you close to me so I can keep an eye on you. You're a menace! [flies his sleigh above Sandy's rocket; SpongeBob falls on Santa's face, but Santa pulls him off] First, I'll push Sandy's rocket ship out of harm's way. SpongeBob, hand me that jack-in-the-box.
SpongeBob: [digs in Santa's sack and pulls out a jack-in-the-box] Jack-in-the-box.
[Santa winds up the jack-in-the-box and launches it at Sandy's rocket. The toy pushes the rocket off the moon's surface.]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh! Let me try! [begins winding the jack-in-the-box]
Santa: Be careful! Don't overwind it!
SpongeBob: But it's gotta be strong enough to move the moon. [carelessly overwinds the jack-in-the-box really tight; the jack-in-the-box stops winding and breaks]
Santa: You broke it, and it was my last one.
SpongeBob: Hmm. [the handle begins turning slowly] Oh, wait. I think I can hear the last note struggling to get out. Come on, Jack, you can do it. I believe in you!
[The jack-in-the-box launches out from the box in a fast pace.]
Santa: Ho-ho-ho-ho!
[The jack-in-the-box hits the moon. But instead of moving it back as it was supposed to, it ends up destroying the moon completely. Various moon rocks float in all directions. SpongeBob and Santa stare in shock.]
SpongeBob: What happened? [Santa grumbles angrily at SpongeBob] Oh. Okay, sorry. It was my bad.
[Moon rocks and debris fly around Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and Squidward look in shock now that the moon is destroyed. Back on Earth and with the moon gone, the ocean level has decreased even more and there is nothing but standing water. Bikini Bottomites are now crawling on their legs and arms.]
Frankie Billy: [runs into Martha Smith] Oh, excuse me. Sorry. [chuckles]
[Frankie Billy gets up and dries up from the heat so Martha can walk by. Back in space, Santa is overwhelmed at what SpongeBob did to the moon.]
Santa: Oh-oh-oh.
SpongeBob: Oh-oh-oh?
Santa: Ho-ho-ho backwards. [sulks on his sleigh]
[SpongeBob thinks and comes up with an idea to fix this problem once and for all.]
SpongeBob: [leans closer to Santa's ear] Santa, do you have any water shooters in your bag?
Santa: Yes, the whole sack is full of 'em.
[SpongeBob digs in Santa's sack and finds a pile of water shooters. SpongeBob grabs a water shooter and gives it to Santa.]
SpongeBob: All right, Santa, squirt me.
Santa: [takes the water shooter] Oh, I get it.
[SpongeBob takes off his helmet and Santa sprays SpongeBob with water to make him bigger.]
SpongeBob: Whoo! Keep 'em coming, Santa!
[Santa grabs another water shooter and sprays SpongeBob with water to make him even more bigger. Back on Earth, the Bikini Bottomites are flopping around due to the decreased water level. But then, something miraculous happened. The water level rises up and the oceans are back to normal. Sandy's rocket flies back down to Earth and Sandy's treedome flies back into its rightful place on the ground. Sandy, Squidina, and Squidward exit the tree.]
Sandy: Using the leftover Fizz Bomb Cola made an excellent rocket fuel, Science Scout Squidina.
Squidina: Yep, the rocket burped us back. [laughs]
Pearl: [pulls herself out of Sandy's tree] Wow! Would you mind teaching me some nerdy science stuff?
Squidina: Sure, if you'll teach me some airhead cheerleader stuff.
[Pearl and Squidina, who have now put aside their differences, skip happily out of Sandy's treedome, nearly knocking over Sandy and Squidward.]
Sandy: Why don't you join the Science Scouts, Squidward?
Squidward: No, thanks! Science is crazy and filled with lunatics! [leaves in disgust]
Sandy: Speaking of luna, I wonder how old SpongeBob is doing.
[The scene changes to New York City at night. SpongeBob, now as a temporary moon until Santa creates a brand new one, rises in the night sky and look down at the city.]
SpongeBob: Good night, Earth! Hey, I'm mooning you. [laughs] Hello, lady. You sure look lovely by moonlight.
Lady: Aww!
SpongeBob: Hey, mister! I can see your bald spot.
Man #1: Hey!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Don't be alarmed, people. I'm only here 'til December, when Santa brings everybody a new moon for Christmas.
[The citizens on the ground are honking their horns and groan as they start complaining.]
Man #2: Come on!
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry. Just gave away the big surprise, didn't I? Oh, well. Merry early Christmas!
Santa: [flies past SpongeBob with his sleigh] Ho-ho-ho! You're a menace!
[SpongeBob giggles and winks at the audience, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins at a beautiful morning at SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: [bouncing up and down on the bed] Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [continues bouncing] Oh, Gary, I'm so excited! [jumps off] Tonight, they're showing the only episode of "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy" that I've never seen! Whoo-hoo!
Gary: Meow, meow!
[SpongeBob carries Gary to the bathroom and squirts Tooth Toothpaste on his toothbrush.]
SpongeBob: It was lost...[pulls out his dentures and brushes them] to the sands of time. [put his dentures back in his mouth; he and Gary jump in the bathtub and SpongeBob scrubs himself] Until they found a copy in the producer's underwear drawer. [pulls lever and the tub flies them into the wringer]
Gary: Meow.
[SpongeBob lands in his pants and Gary lands in his shell.]
SpongeBob: [shows Gary the poster] It's part two of the two-part special, "The Case of the Curious Cliff Hanger." Well, I've rearranged the living room for optimal TV viewing. [shows the living room all set for his television viewing]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: [shows the popcorn machine] The popcorn's a-popping.
Gary: [gets hit in the eye by a popcorn kernel] Meow.
SpongeBob: [shows several soda bottles in a frozen ice block] And the soda's on ice. All that's left is to set the VCR to record [sets up the VCR to record] so I can relive the magic over and over forever. [his teeth roll around in his mouth like movie film] Hmm, but which tape to use? Don't have any blank ones left. Hmm. [picks a tape that views his own birth] Oh, here we go. Who needs a tape of their own birth, anyway? [puts the tape in the VCR] Yoop, done! [puts on his Krusty Krab working hat] Now it's just one quick shift at the Krusty Krab, and I'll be back for the evening's entertainment. [laughs as his bubbles form into a laughing mouth]
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob is growing impatient.]
SpongeBob: Normally I like working, but today is moving [close-up of his face in slow-motion] so slowly.
[SpongeBob peaks in through the kitchen window and sees everything moving in a slow pace. Two customers are chewing their food real slow. Nat bite his Krabby Patty, but slaps Fred in the face, making him spit out his food. Patrick opens his mouth and eats the food. SpongeBob sulks and slides back in the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Oh, at this rate I'm never gonna see "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy." [groans]
[SpongeBob flips some patties and forms them into the faces of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.]
SpongeBob: Hmm?
Barnacle Boy Patty: We'll help you get through the day, SpongeBob.
Mermaid Man Patty: And tonight we'll conquer evil!
SpongeBob: Aw, you guys always make me feel better. [leans on the grill and burns his arms] Hmm? [removes his arms from the grill and they disintegrate; he laughs]
French Narrator: One Shift Later...
[Mr. Krabs is counting money and Squidward is manning the register. SpongeBob bursts out from the door and runs past them in a fast pace, leaving a trail of fire and leaving Mr. Krabs in his underwear.]
SpongeBob: All right, bye, Squidward! Bye, Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] See you tomorrow! [bumps into Mrs. Puff's boat]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, SpongeBob. My boat has a flat tire. Could you help me change it?
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, well, [points to his watch] I gotta get home for "Mermaid Man," but—but sure, I guess I have a little time.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, good. Let me know when you're done. [picks up a mug of coffee and a book entitled, "Gone with the Fin"]
SpongeBob: Luckily, I brought all my tools. [pulls his tie, opens his head and shows a variety of tools] Jack, wrench, hammer, jackhammer—[activates jackhammer and drills in the ground] Whoa! [comes back out] Jack-wrench, wrench-hammer, hammer-hammer. Okay, I'm ready!
[SpongeBob goes underneath Mrs. Puff's boat, levers it up like a jack, and pulls out a pair of scissors.]
SpongeBob: Gotta get that old tire off. And... [cuts the tire into paper dolls and laughs; goes to put a new tire on] Yes? No. Maybe if I try...[groans]
[SpongeBob struggles to put the tire on the wheel, but it slips off and is sent flying to the surface.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Ah-ha!
[Mrs. Puff sleeps until she feels her boat moving.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mrs. Puff. Good to go.
[Mrs. Puff drives her boat to her house. She looks down at her wheel and sees SpongeBob implanted himself onto it.]
Mrs. Puff: Thanks again, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, no problem, Mrs. Puff.
[SpongeBob is beaten up from getting crushed by the rocky roads. He pokes a hole, deflates, and flies everywhere. He then looks at his watch.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. I still have time to get home before my show, if I pick up the pace. [runs straight to his house] Ah, home sweet pineapple!
Patrick: Hey, buddy! You got a minute?
SpongeBob: [pops his face out from his back] Oh, uh, not really, but—
Patrick: I double-parked my rock, and it got towed. [shows his spot where his rock was and a sign says "No Rock Parking"] Could you help me get it back?
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, sure. Uh, but let's make it quick. "Mermaid Man" is on soon.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick at the Impound Yard.]
Impound worker: You'se guys can take a look around on your owns. [opens door]
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the junkyard and sees that everything looks exactly like Patrick's rock.]
SpongeBob: They all look the same, Patrick. How are we gonna find your rock?
Patrick: Don't worry, buddy. I'll know it when I feel it. Oh, this might be it! Give me a hand!
[SpongeBob lifts the rock up with all his might. Patrick rolls underneath and SpongeBob drops it.]
Patrick: Ow! No, this isn't it. Oh, ooh, this one might be it!
[SpongeBob lifts another rock and Patrick slides underneath it. SpongeBob drops it on Patrick.]
Patrick: Ouch! No, this isn't it either. Ow! No. Ow! No. [shouts] No. [screams] No.
[SpongeBob holds up the last remaining rock up for Patrick. Patrick slides underneath it and SpongeBob drops it on him.]
Patrick: [sighs] This is it. This is my rock!
Impound worker: Congratulations. Now there's a little matter of the fee.
Patrick: Oh, talk to him. [picks SpongeBob up and hops on his rock]
SpongeBob: [hands the impound worker money] Here you go.
[The impound worker takes the money and leaves.]
Patrick: [begins driving away with his rock] Thanks, SpongeBob! See you at home for "Mermaid Man!" Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, Patrick! Could you give me a...ride? [groans and a rock crushes him]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob running past Sandy's treedome.]
Sandy: SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. I could really use your help.
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Sandy. Uh, I'm kind of in a rush 'cause "Mermaid Man" is on and it's the lost episode—
Sandy: Oh, it won't take more than a minute.
[SpongeBob looks at his watch and groans.]
Sandy: My laser acorn experiment blasted a nut-sized hole in my dome. Could you stick your finger here while I go get my fix-it-up kit?
SpongeBob: I don't really have a lot of time to—
Sandy: [plugs the hole with SpongeBob's finger] Thanks, be right back! [runs into her dome]
[SpongeBob sees two unnamed kids passing by.]
Kid #1: Gosh, I can't wait to see that long lost "Mermaid Man" episode tonight.
Kid #2: Oh, for sure. No real fan would miss it. Not for the world.
[SpongeBob panics and struggles to break free. Sandy comes back out with her fix-it-up kit.]
Sandy: All righty, SpongeBob. I'm ready to—What? [sees his hand dangling where the punctured hole is]
[SpongeBob regenerates his arm and runs to his house as fast as he could.]
SpongeBob: That's it! No more distractions! I am gonna—[gets grabbed by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Boy-o, you gotta help me sort me loose change!
SpongeBob: But "Mermaid Man."
[Mr. Krabs dumps a bucket full of coins over SpongeBob's head. The coins come out in tiny little coin rolls. Mr. Krabs places the coin rolls in his bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, boy-o!
[SpongeBob gets up, looks at his watch and panics. He runs out of Mr. Krabs' house, leaving a trail of coins behind.]
SpongeBob: [panting] Don't wanna miss it! Don't wanna miss it! [gets stopped by Larry who wants to have him put tanning lotion on his back] But "Mermaid Man." [then he's asked to help change light bulbs with Plankton at the Chum Bucket] But "Mermaid Man." [then he's asked to help plant vegetables in Squidward's garden] But "Mermaid Man." [shows him giving a line of senior citizens a foot massage at Shady Shoals] But "Mermaid Man." [shows him being a crossing guard in Bikini Bottom to help people cross the street] But "Mermaid Man." [shows him helping the Flying Dutchman mop up the deck on his ship] But "Mermaid Man."
[The scene changes to nighttime. An exhausted SpongeBob walks up to the front door of his house.]
SpongeBob: [sighs and looks at his watch] Well, I may have missed the live broadcast, but at least I got it all on tape. Here I come, "Mermaid Man!" [tries to open the door but it's locked] Oh. [tries to pull it open but to no avail; he checks his pockets] Where'd I put my keys? [peaks through the window] Did I leave them on the table again? [sees his VCR going haywire and it spits out the tape's film] No, my tape! [the ice block explodes and soda flies everywhere] My soda! [the popcorn machine explodes] My popcorn! [sees everything a complete mess] My "Mermaid Man!" [the house bursts into flames and he screams]
[Gary gets shot out of the house on a flying soda bottle. SpongeBob goes to catch Gary, but he lands on his face.]
Gary: Meow. [slithers off of SpongeBob]
[SpongeBob, completely shocked at what happened, started feeling really sad and begins to cry. His crying was so loud and powerful that it was heard all across Bikini Bottom, which resulted in waking the townsfolk up. Moments later, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, Larry, Mr. Krabs, Plankton and Mrs. Puff arrive to see what was the matter.]
Sandy: Hey there, SpongeBob. Why all the waterworks?
SpongeBob: [sniffles and wipes his tears with his nose like a windshield wiper] I was so busy helping everyone that I missed "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy" and my VCR didn't record it and now I'll never see it and my life has no meaning!
[SpongeBob sulks away from his friends and goes back into his burning house in tears, now that his chances of seeing the long-lost episode of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy has been shattered. All of SpongeBob's friends including Squidward look on at him with sad faces and realized what they had done: they took his kindness for granted and inexplicably ruined his chances of seeing the episode he's been looking forward to watching.]
Sandy: All right, listen up. SpongeBob has helped every single one of us dozens of times over. But we ain't been very helpful to him today.
[All of his friends murmur in agreement.]
Patrick: Yeah, I was a lousy friend.
Sandy: Now, we may have taken advantage of his kindness, but I got a plan to make things right.
[They hover together and Sandy quietly explains her plan in hopes of making up to SpongeBob for letting him miss the show.]
French Narrator: The Next Day...
[The scene changes to the next morning. SpongeBob's living room is a complete mess and is covered with burnt popcorn and soda bottles. SpongeBob goes into a state of deep depression and holds out a burnt videotape. He drops the tape and moves his finger around.]
SpongeBob: Play… [drinks a bottle of burnt soda and eats some burnt popcorn]
Sandy: [knocks on the door and peaks through the window] Hey there, SpongeBob. Feeling any better?
[SpongeBob mutters in depression.]
Sandy: Aww, [jumps in through the window] why don't you come with me? I have a little surprise for you.
SpongeBob: I'm not really in the mood, Sandy.
Sandy: Aww, quit acting like a calf with colic. [pushes SpongeBob out with his chair] Come on, SpongeBob. [pushes him to a television-themed outdoor amphiltheater]
SpongeBob: Gee, Sandy, where'd you get an outdoor amphitheater?
Sandy: Don't worry about that. Just sit right here and enjoy the play.
SpongeBob: Oh, okay.
[Plankton comes out from the curtains and knocks the microphone over so he can speak into it.]
Plankton: Welcome, ladies and morons! It's time for the exciting conclusion to...[the curtains open] "The Case of the Curious Cliffhanger!" [laughs]
SpongeBob: [wakes up from his depression] Huh? Whoa! [laughs and pulls his chair forward to watch it closer]
[On the stage, Squidward is dressed as Doctor Negative, Mrs. Puff is the Atomic Flounder, Gary is the Dirty Bubble, Larry is Mermaid Man, and Patrick is Barnacle Boy.]
Larry: Help me, Barnacle Boy. I'm hanging...from this cliff.
[A cardboard cloud falls down.]
Patrick: And look, I am also hanging from this cliff. We sure are in danger.
[SpongeBob covers his eyes, but pop them out through his head to see. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs as Captain Tightwad fighting against Larry as Mermaid Man.]
Mr. Krabs: [grunts] You should give up while you can, Mermaid Man.
[Squidward struggles to hold Mr. Krabs up, but ends up swinging him up and down.]
Larry: Haven't you heard, Captian Tightwad? I'll never give up fighting...um...Line?
Mrs. Puff: [struggling to hold Larry up] Oh, um...[looks through the script book and whispers] Evil.
Larry: Evil!
[Three cannons steam smoke out at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs falls to the floor and Squidward falls on top of him. The curtain closes over Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Wow! Yes, yes!
[The scene changes to the play's grand finale. During the finale, Sandy is dressed as Miss Appear and Plankton is wearing a Man Ray helmet. The rest of the cast remain as Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, the Atomic Flounder, the Dirty Bubble, Doctor Negative, and Captain Tightwad.]
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪He may be half a mermaid!♪
Gary: ♪Meow!♪
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪And he may be half a man!♪
Gary: ♪Meow!♪
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪But to us he's more than a hero!♪
Gary: ♪Meow, meow!♪
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪He's our Mermaid Man!♪
[Plankton pushes the button on the remote and ignites fireworks for the finale as Larry makes Mermaid Man's hero pose.]
SpongeBob: [sheds a tear and whistles] Ah, oh, bravo! Bravo! Bravo! [laughs as he bounces around in happiness] Yes! Ah! [flies onto the stage like a rocket] Thank you, everyone! [hugs all of his friends] I loved the show! And I loved the love you showed me! And I love how you showed me the love you showed me in the show I love. [his eyes widen] This is my favorite episode of "Mermaid Man" ever!
[SpongeBob and all of his friends cheer in happiness. Just then, Old Man Jenkins arrives on the stage.]
Old Man Jenkins: Hey! What are you kids doing in my outdoor amphitheater?
Sandy: [screams] Cheese it, everyone! It's Old Man Jenkins! [screams]
[Everyone, except SpongeBob, run off the stage.]
Old Man Jenkins: Come back! I just wanna be in the play.
SpongeBob: Aww, I'll play with you, Old Man Jenkins. [hands Old Man Jenkins a purple starfish] Do you wanna be Mermaid Man?
Old Man Jenkins: It's the role of my dreams! [places the starfish on his face and flies in the sky] Zoom! [laughs] Whoo!
[SpongeBob laughs and the screen turns black, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket. Karen is spending some quality time with another computer named Hanna.]
Karen: Oh, it was so great catching up with you, Hanna. [she and Hanna give a toast to each other] It's been too long.
[Hanna eats a green microchip and sneezes on Karen's computer screen.]
Karen: Oh, you poor thing. Sounds like you have a bug. Better go home and reboot. [escorts Hanna to the door] Remember, only keywords tonight. You need to rest your processor.
Plankton: [off-screen] Karen!
[Plankton is shown waiting for his meal.]
Karen: What do you want? [sneezes and groans while showing the thermometer on her screen]
Plankton: Oh, no. Your nodes are swollen. That old bucket of bolts gave you a computer virus.
Karen: Oh, nonsense. I'm the fastest computer alive. [stammers as she short-circuits and goes haywire]
[Karen rams into the wall.]
Karen: Uh-oh. [laughs] My ones and zeroes look like 10, 10, 10, 10.
Plankton: Someone's gonna have to get inside you and kill that virus. It's probably a suicide mission. [lifts Karen's hand] But who would be stupid enough to—[hears someone knocking on the door; he opens and it turns out to be SpongeBob hitting it with a hammer on his head] What now?
SpongeBob: [falls over and uses his tongue to get himself up] Oh, I'm just helping out the Health Department.
Plankton: Hmm. [puts on glasses and reads the sign on the door] "Sanitary notice. The Chum Bucket hereby gets a grade Z from the Health Department." [throws away the glasses] Hey, that's up from a negative Z last week.
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Plankton. In a few more years, you're sure to get an F. [stuffs his hammer in his hammer, pulls his right leg off, and trips over] Whoa!
Plankton: [throws SpongeBob's leg away] Never mind about that. I have a snow job—Uh, job for you. Karen needs your help. She asked for you personally.
Karen: [off-screen] ♪Who lives in a crabapple under a pea♪
SpongeBob: Hey, catchy song.
[The scene changes to Karen being placed on the examination table.]
Karen: ♪Observant and yellow fellow is he♪
[Plankton straps SpongeBob with a jet backpack with weaponry items in it.]
SpongeBob: We need a name for this mission. How about, "Journey to the Center of Karen?" No. "The Mainframe Mission." Nah. Ooh, I know. "Operation: Save Karen." [holds up a drawing of SpongeBob with the words "Operation: Save Karen" on it]
Plankton: Whatever, just blast the virus when you see it.
SpongeBob: Oh, like this? [pushes the button and lasers fire all over the place, causing them all to explode] Oops.
Karen: [laughs] That tickles. [laughs]
Plankton: [blows the fire out on his antenna] Here, use this. [gives SpongeBob the flyswatter]
SpongeBob: But Plankton, how am I supposed to—[gets zapped by Plankton's teleporter] Whoa!
[SpongeBob appears on the computer screen about Plankton.]
SpongeBob: [laughs and gets poked by Plankton's injector] Ow!
[Plankton absorbs SpongeBob in the injector and pokes it into medical liter bag. SpongeBob then flows through the bag and into the Karen's computerized blood stream.]
Plankton: [climbs down and comforts Karen] Don't worry, baby. Help is on the way.
Karen: Get away. [smacks Plankton]
[Plankton is sent flying over to some cut wires and gets himself electrocuted.]
Plankton: Ow!
[The screen zooms into Karen's hard drive while she downloads SpongeBob. The screen shows Karen's hard drive being created and SpongeBob is digitally teleported in her.]
SpongeBob: [shakes the data particles off] Whoa! [sees the inside of Karen for the first time. Tall structures on the motherboard spread out before SpongeBob like a bustling city.] Super-awesome-ular-tastic! [his eyeballs inflate and pop] Wow! [restores his eyeballs] Huh?
[A computerized megaphone appears next to SpongeBob.]
Plankton: [via megaphone] SpongeBob, can you hear me? [normal] Come in, SpongeBob. [dodges Karen's incoming arm] Talk to me, you digitized doofus!
SpongeBob: Plankton, I do not respond to insults.
Plankton: [via megaphone; sighs] Okay. Just look for any destruction and follow it to the virus. Sweetheart.
SpongeBob: Got it, Honey. [skips backwards until he comes to a hole created by the virus; he falls downward] Whoa!
[SpongeBob grabs onto a loose wire to prevent himself from falling. But he loses the flyswatter as it falls and gets eaten by the virus. Meanwhile, outside of Karen's body, Karen gets off the examination table and rips the medical bag off her.]
Karen: [laughs] I want a Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Baby!
Karen: [plows through the door] Bye-bye!
Plankton: [follows her outside] SpongeBob, hurry up and kill that virus before it completely destroys Karen!
[Karen picks up a boat and throws it in the sky, destroying the Krusty Krab sign and making a flower cloud fall. Plankton's jaw drops and his eyeball falls on his tongue in shock.]
Karen: Knock, knock! [rips the front door off the Krusty Krab]
Plankton: Huh? Great Neptune's nostrils! [sticks his eyeball back and runs to the Krusty Krab]
[Back inside Karen, SpongeBob falls into the hole and lands in a puddle of green slime.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [picks up a sample of the green slime] Hmm. [gasps] The virus!
[SpongeBob follows slime trail and sees the destruction the virus created.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, it looks like the virus is heading to Karen's memory banks.
[Back at the Krusty Krab, Karen is going on a rampage all over the place.]
Plankton: Listen, if it gets to her memory, it'll fry her hard drive completely. I need you to destroy that virus right now!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, I need you to control your wife. Er, computer, or whatever.
Plankton: Mind your own business, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: This is my business!
[Karen grabs and throws Squidward away. She then climbs into the register boat and begins flirting with the cash register.]
Karen: Hello there, baby! Where've you been all my life?
Mr. Krabs: [screams and grabs the cash register] Please don't break up our happy home. I forgive you, baby. [kisses the cash register, heads into his office and closes his door]
Plankton: Wow, I can never unsee that.
[Back inside Karen, SpongeBob pulls himself up a ledge and sees everything dark. He looks around to see if there's any destruction caused by the virus, but he accidentally activates a security button.]
Karen: Intruder detected.
[The floor glows and lasers fire at SpongeBob. But just as SpongeBob was about to get blasted, someone pushed him safely out of the way. It was a computerized version of Plankton, but he's taller, muscular, and more heroic than his evil counterpart. He is called Ideal Plankton. Ideal Plankton pulls out a laser gun and blasts the lasers with it. He opens the floor, grabs SpongeBob and falls through it. He and SpongeBob land safely on the ground.]
SpongeBob: Plankton?
Ideal Plankton: That's my name. [his teeth glimmers] Actually, I'm Karen's version of Plankton. You know, how she'd like to see me. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Ooh, you have beautiful eye. [rubs Ideal Plankton's eye]
Ideal Plankton: We'd better get moving.
[Ideal Plankton runs off while SpongeBob follows. Meanwhile, the virus is eating up everything in Karen's hard drive. The virus eats up the House of Anger.]
Karen: Anger control center abolished.
[The virus then eats up the Tunnel of Love.]
Karen: Love center destroyed.
[Ideal Plankton climbs up a wall with SpongeBob on his back. He punches a hole through the wall and climbs through it. The wall turns right-side up, revealing itself to be a floor. SpongeBob and Ideal Plankton climb out from the floor while all of a sudden, a virus version of Mr. Krabs appears.]
Money Krabs: Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, is that you?
Ideal Plankton: It's Karen's version of Krabs.
SpongeBob: Hey, looking good, Mr. K.
[Then a blue, slimy, and ugly virus version of Squidward appears.]
Gnarly Squid: I hate everything. [drops to the ground and leaks slime]
Ideal Plankton: That's how Karen sees Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hmm? [puts make-up on] Uh, nothing like a little make-up couldn't fix. [chuckles] Hey, I wonder if Karen has a version of me down here.
[A virus version of SpongeBob appears.]
Off Model SpongeBob: Woop, woop, zing, zing. Woop, woop, zing, zing.
SpongeBob: Ooh, now that guy's a hunk.
[Suddenly, the siren goes off.]
Karen: Intruder in section B. Eliminate.
[Off Model SpongeBob, Gnarly Squid, and Money Krabs fire laser beams at SpongeBob and Ideal Plankton. SpongeBob and Ideal Plankton dodge the incoming lasers. Ideal Plankton blasts Money Krabs into little pennies, which have faces of Money Krabs on them.]
SpongeBob: [gets hit by the pennies] Ow! [blows the pennies out of his holes and grabs one of them; the penny then bites SpongeBob's thumb] Yeowch! [drops the penny]
[Ideal Plankton grabs Gnarly Squid and squeezes him really tight.]
Gnarly Squid: Owie, owie, owie. [explodes into a puddle of slime]
Ideal Plankton: What a drip.
[Off Model SpongeBob comes charging towards SpongeBob.]
Off Model SpongeBob: Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
[SpongeBob screams and runs over to Off Model SpongeBob.]
Off Model SpongeBob: Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
[SpongeBob continues to run and scream as he rams into Off Model SpongeBob. But in doing so, he transforms into an exact copy of Off Model SpongeBob himself.]
SpongeBob: Duh.
Off Model SpongeBob: Duh.
SpongeBob: Doy.
Off Model SpongeBob: Doy.
SpongeBob: Duh.
Off Model SpongeBob: Duh.
SpongeBob: Doy.
Off Model SpongeBob: Doy.
Ideal Plankton: Neptune's network! Which one of you is the real SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob and Off Model SpongeBob point at each other. Then stare at themselves in confusion.]
Ideal Plankton: I'll have to use all the computation power I have to figure this out. Eeny, meeny, miney, moe. [blasts Off Model SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Duh, duh, doy, doy. Duh, duh, doy, doy.
Ideal Plankton: Oh, no. I think I destroyed the wrong SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Duh, duh, doy—[shakes himself back to his normal form] How do I look?
Ideal Plankton: Stunning.
[Just then, an explosion knocks over Ideal Plankton from behind. Out from the smoke appears the virus. It roars and lets out blobs of green slime everywhere.]
Ideal Plankton: Hmm. Voracious virus!
[The virus slithers over to Karen's memory banks. Ideal Plankton sees a wire dangling from above.]
Ideal Plankton: There's still time to save Karen. [pulls off one of his antennas, ties it to a wire and through it to the lose wire for them to swing across] You first.
[SpongeBob swings across while imitating a Tarzan-like yell. He barely makes it to the ledge.]
SpongeBob: Whoops. Did I do good?
[Part of the ledge crumbles under Ideal Plankton's feet.]
Ideal Plankton: You did great. But I think you could use a little push.
[Ideal Plankton uses his eyeball to push SpongeBob closer to the other side.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, okay, your turn.
[But before Ideal Plankton can have his turn to swing across, the ground beneath him gave way and he falls into the ravine below.]
Ideal Plankton: It's up to you, SpongeBob! You must save Karen!
SpongeBob: No!
Ideal Plankton: What do you mean, no?!
SpongeBob: I mean, yes!
[Meanwhile, Karen is driving crazily in a boatmobile with Plankton sitting in the passenger seat.]
Plankton: Uh, sweetie, maybe we should slow down and pull over. Honey? Precious?
Karen: No way, Plankie! It's me and you, amigo! Whoo-hoo! [drives over to the Wagon Wheel] Oh, hot dog! Let's go dancing! Whoo-hoo! [crashes the boat and enters the Wagon Wheel to join some square dancers] Whoo-hoo, yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Plankton: How are all these people able to dance here in the middle of the day? Don't they have jobs?
Karen: Whoo! [laughs and spins]
[Plankton is flung over to a female square dancer.]
Plankton: SpongeBob, come in, SpongeBob! If you're gonna do anything, do it now! Karen's about to melt down!
[Karen's computer screen begins to glow red and heat up.]
Female hick: Oh, such a cute one-eyed baby.
Plankton: SpongeBob!
[Back inside of Karen, SpongeBob makes it to the memory banks, in which he dashes to the entrance off. Inside, SpongeBob sees various memories Karen stored from the past. All the memories are pink, brain-shaped structures and they're showing footage from older episodes. The virus slithers over to one memory and takes a bite from it. The screen shows nothing but static after he's eaten it. SpongeBob runs between some columns, with one destroyed as a casualty of the virus. He runs up to the virus and forms himself into a stop sign shape as a confrontation to the virus.]
SpongeBob: Stop munching on those memories, you monster!
[The virus turns and charges in on SpongeBob. But SpongeBob dodges it and the virus roars out green slime, and it splatters onto SpongeBob, in which he spins around and has on his karate gear after he stops spining.]
SpongeBob: [having donned his karate gear] Hi-yah!
[The virus morphs itself into a towering dragon and blows fire at SpongeBob. The fire engulfs SpongeBob and when the flames dissipate, SpongeBob's karate gear is replaced with pink cat attire.]
SpongeBob: [nervously]Meow?
[SpongeBob makes a run for it, with the virus trailing right behind. SpongeBob runs past more memories until he runs into a brick wall, which is a dead end.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, I'm at the edge of Karen's memory! She has to create more memories! I need space to run.
[Karen bursts out from the Wagon Wheel and heads straight for Bikini Bottom.]
Plankton: [running after her] Is my running after here enough of a memory?
[The wall only moves a few inches.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm afraid not.
[A shadow looms over SpongeBob, who presses his back against the wall in fear. The virus dragon blows smoke from his nostrils like a bull, and he closes in on SpongeBob, only for his body parts to disassemble and scatter as the virus reverts back to normal.  SpongeBob spins and puts himself back together, holding one yellow cube in his hand.]
SpongeBob: I always wind up with one extra piece. [He throws it on the ground and the virus eats it.] Oh, you must be hungry. That's why you're eating through Karen.
Virus: [with a pleading face] I'm always hungry.
SpongeBob: [rubbing his face sympathetically] You poor, ugly, disgusting little virus. I know what you need.
[Back outside, Karen grows tired and her screen steams up smoke. Then she finally stops moves and shuts off.]
Plankton: SpongeBob, I've decided to pull you out! We're abandoning Operation: Save Karen.
SpongeBob: [opens up Karen's screen like a door] I got the virus. [jumps out with a microscope] Look.
[Plankton looks through the microscope and sees the virus.]
Virus: Hi, there!
SpongeBob: [grabs the virus and puts it on a Krabby Patty. The virus may have been huge when SpongeBob journeyed through Karen, but it looks a lot smaller on top of the Krabby Patty.] Here you go, little fella. It'll take the virus 300 years to chew its way through this sandwich.
Virus: Whoo-hoo!
Karen: [wakes up] Oh. Huh?
Plankton: [being shown as Ideal Plankton as Karen looks at him] Baby, you're all right!
Karen: Nope. I'm still delirious. But I like it! [laughs]


[The episode begins with a montage of a brand new location, Bubbletown, a local city that is made entirely out of bubbles.]
Narrator: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the most fascinating place on Earth, Bubbletown! A bouncing, vibrant city, where everyone...[four bubble ducks quack] and everything is comprised entirely of globules of air!
[A bubble family forge into one big bubble. The bubble then pops into a million bubbles. SpongeBob, who is visiting Bubbletown, is fascinated at the scenery.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [brings it around town] A whole city made of bubbles! I'm so excited!
Narrator: Let's take a closer look at this effervescent city! Some bubbletowners drive to work in their bubble cars. While others simply float. Having a bubble car is great because parking is a cinch! [a bubble person pops his bubble car] Bubbletown also provides excellent public transportation. Seats are always available because these high-tech buses can account for any number of passengers. [a bubble bus lets out several bubble people] Here are some workers going to work in their bubble building.
[The bubble workers enter their building through the bubble wall. SpongeBob attempts to do the same, but his body is too solid.]
Narrator: [laughs] You may wanna use the door. [shows a montage of bubble workers working on their bubble computers] This office uses stand-up desks, and the ceiling for a more efficient work environment.
[SpongeBob is standing upside-down on the bubble ceiling. He falls down onto the bubble floor.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, whoa-whoa. [gets engulfed in a bubble] Wow! [laughs]
[The scene changes to Bubbletown Park where a band is playing.]
Narrator: Yes, there's all kinds of things to see and do in Bubbletown! You can enjoy Bubbletown's very own band!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! [scatting and dancing until his stomach begins to growl]
Narrator: And if you're hungry, why not try a bubble dog from one of our many bubble food vendors?
SpongeBob: One, please?
Bubble hot dog vendor: [gives SpongeBob a bubble hot dog] Here you are.
SpongeBob: Mmm! [eats the bubble hot dog and suds foam out; burps loudly] Oh, yeah! I am rabid for these dogs! [laughs] Huh? Hey, it's my old pal, Bubble Buddy! Hiya, Bubble Buddy!
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gee, it's good to see ya! [hugs Bubble Buddy really tight]
Bubble Buddy: Whoa! [groans as SpongeBob accidentally splits his body in half]
SpongeBob: Uh, oops. Sorry.
Bubble Buddy: Oh, don't worry about it.
SpongeBob: So, how you been? How are things?
Bubble Buddy: Oh. Not so good, SpongeBob. On my way into town, I got a flat tire on my motor scooter. [shows his motor scooter's front flat tire]
SpongeBob: Let me see if I can fix that for you.
[SpongeBob takes his shoe off, pulls out a bubble wand, dips it in a bottle of soap, and blows the motor scooter into a motorcycle.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
Bubble Buddy: All right!
Bubble Man #1: Say, that was some pretty handy bubble work you did there, son.
Bubble Buddy: Why, SpongeBob is the best bubble blower I know. He can inflate and create anything!
Bubble Man #1: You don't say? Hey, can you help me? I've got a small leak in my roof. [shows his roofless bubble house as a bubble raincloud rains down]
Bubble Wife: Honey! [screams]
SpongeBob: I can help you? By blowing bubbles? Oh...[sighs and faints]
Bubble Buddy: And...clear! [zaps him with the bubble defibrillator]
SpongeBob: Count me in!
Bubble Man #1: Fantastic!
Bubble Man #2: Say, when you're done helping him, my house could use a new rec room!
[SpongeBob is writing a list down on his clipboard.]
Bubble Lady #1: I need some pajamas.
SpongeBob: [writes it down] Okay, mm, uh-huh.
Bubble Man #3: I want another sandwich!
[SpongeBob writes it down.]
Bubble Man #4: Monster truck tires!
SpongeBob: [writes it down] Never fear, people of Bubbletown! I'm on it!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, wearing bubble spurs and a bubble cowboy hat, makes a western cowboy stance as he looks upon Bubbletown. The bubble straw he was chewing on pops in his face. SpongeBob takes out his bubble wand and bottle of soap. He dips the wand in the soap, blows a really big bubble, and creates a brand new house for one bubble person.]
Bubble Man #1: Wow! Thanks, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob blows some bubbles and forms giant monster truck tires for one bubble person's bubble car.]
Bubble Man #4: All right! [drives his bubble monster truck away]
[SpongeBob blows some more bubbles. The bubbles hit an disgruntled old bubble man with a sore back and forms a scooter for him to ride on. The old bubble man was so happy that he begins riding in his new scooter. SpongeBob then dances around in a happy dance and forms bubble flowers all over the place.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Bubble Buddy, this has been the best day of my life! I love it here in Bubbletown! [laughs and bounces uncontrollably]
Bubble Buddy: Watch out for those—
[SpongeBob crashes into something off-screen.]
Bubble Lady #2: Excuse me, sir, but you seem to have stepped in my dogs.
[SpongeBob looks down and sees two bubble dogs in his feet.]
SpongeBob: Oh, uh-uh, pardon me, ma'am. Let me just—
[SpongeBob attempts to remove his feet out from the bubble dogs, but he slips and pops them underneath him. The dogs are now reduced to a puddle and the bubble lady gasps in horror.]
SpongeBob: Oh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [slips on the suds and lands on the bubble lady, which resulted it getting soap in his eyes] Whoa! [wails in pain] My eyes! [screams as he slips uncontrollably]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob, come back!
Bubble Groom: Amy, will you marry me? [holds out a bubble ring]
Amy: Yes! I will!
[SpongeBob slips into Amy and accidentally pops her.]
Bubble Groom: Aw. [begins to sulk, but SpongeBob slips into him and accidentally pops him]
[The bubble ring pops in mid-air. SpongeBob skids out of control and accidentally pops a line of bubble ducklings and a bubble duck. He then pops some of the bubble buildings in Bubbletown. The scene changes to the bubble mayor giving a grand opening to a new bubble elementary school for bubble children.]
Bubble mayor: I now dedicate this new school for overly cute children.
[The bubble crowd cheers.]
Little bubble boy: I wuv to learn!
[SpongeBob screams as he continue to slip on the suds. Just as the bubble mayor was about to cut the bubble ribbon, SpongeBob slips past him and pops it.]
Bubble mayor: Hey! That was my job! [gets accidentally popped by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I'm so sorry! I can't stop!
[SpongeBob accidentally pops the little bubble boy with his shoe, causing the bubble crowd to gasp.]
SpongeBob: [slow-motion] Watch out! [accidentally pops the bubble crowd and the new bubble elementary school]
[SpongeBob continues to skid out of control.]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob slips into the Bubbletown's bubble sign, bumps into a rock and lands near the shore. He lays flat on his face and cries.]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob! Oh thank goodness, you're okay.
SpongeBob: [gets up] No! Stay away! [shows his face covered in sand, shells, and sticks] I'm a monster! [whimpers] A monster! [Bubble Buddy gasps] Just look at the destruction I hath wrought!
[Bubbletown is now a complete mess from the destruction SpongeBob accidentally caused.]
Bubble Fred: My bubble legs!
Bubble Man #4: [his bubble monster truck's tires pop] My monster truck tires! [his bubble monster truck pops]
Bubble Buddy: Okay, that doesn't look great. [uneasy chuckle] But I'm sure we can get it all sorted out.
[A bubble police car arrives and pops, revealing a bubble police officer.]
Bubble police officer: I'm afraid the only sorting out your friend's going to be doing is in jail. For popping a large portion of the city.
SpongeBob: Okay, take me away! I'm guilty! I deserve whatever punishment you give me.
[The bubble police officer handcuffs him with bubble handcuffs. The scene changes to Bubbletown Prison. The bubble police officer gives SpongeBob the bubble telephone.]
Bubble police officer: All right, you get one phone call.
SpongeBob: Okay. [dials the number on the bubble telephone; the line thrills and a recorded voice is going] The machine, hold on. Gotta leave a message. One second. [the bubble telephone beeps; as he talks through the bubble telephone, it forms into a big bubble] Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me three life sentences, so um...so um...[sniffs] I might be late for my next shift! I'm so sorry! [pushes the bubble message out the bubble window of Bubbletown Prison and cries]
French Narrator: Later…
[Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs comes out from his office and is shocked to see a long line of starving customers. Squidward is sleeping one the cash register.]
Mr. Krabs: [yells loudly in Squidward's face] Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: [pulls his hat off to straighten out his face] Du, huh, what, who?
Mr. Krabs: What's going on here? How long have these folks been waiting to give me their money?
[Old Man Jenkins passes out and dies. His angel begins to exit his body, but he grabs it and stuffs it back in.]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm okay!
Mr. Krabs: Well…?
Squidward: What's the point? There's no one in the kitchen to make any food.
Mr. Krabs: [peaks into the kitchen and looks around; talks high-pitched] What?! Where's SpongeBob? Didn't he call in?
[Just then, SpongeBob's bubble message floats in and an image of SpongeBob appears on it as it breaks air.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me—[Mr. Krabs pops the bubble message before it finishes]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, barnacles. Me fry cook's in the clink. You have the conn, Mr. Squidward. I'll be back as soon as I can! [runs out to go rescue SpongeBob from Bubbletown Prison]
Customers: Wha—whoa. [fall over like domino blocks]
[Back at Bubbletown Prison, SpongeBob is lifting weights with some bubble prisoners. All of a sudden, Mr. Krabs appears and pops Bubbletown Prison wall, which resulted in freeing some bubble prisoners including the Dirty Bubble.]
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [pulls SpongeBob off] This is a prison break, boy-o. Let's get a move on! We've got a bunch of hungry customers back home, and I need your help fleecing—I mean, I mean feeding them!
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I can't go. I haven't finished paying my debt to society yet.
Mr. Krabs: [stammers] Can't go? When I say we're leaving, we're leaving!
Bubble police officer: Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!
Mr. Krabs: Eat claw, bubble cop!
[Mr. Krabs clamps his claws and spins around and around like a helicopter.]
Bubble police officer: Uh-huh?
[Mr. Krabs flies over towards to bubble police officer and chases him in the Bubbletown Prison. Mr. Krabs' sharp claws proceeds to pops everything into Bubbletown Prison and completely destroys it. He then destroys a bubble house's roof.]
Bubble Wife: Honey!
[Mr. Krabs spins uncontrollably and continuously pops all of Bubbletown until everything is nothing more than puddles of suds. The last thing he pops is a small bubble duckling, which he falls on top off.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Good thing they were all just bubbles, eh? Okay, let's get out of here. [pulls off SpongeBob's face by accident] Uh-oh. [pastes it back on him]
SpongeBob: [falls to the ground in complete shock] You popped it all. [his eyes tear up] There's nothing left!
Mr. Krabs: Forget it, SpongeBob. It's Bubbletown.
SpongeBob: No! I can't forget it. Just leave me here, Mr. Krabs. My tears will be a fitting memorial to the bubble city that I loved. [his tears form a replica of Bubbletown on the ground as he sobs]
Bubble Buddy: [shows up with a big bottle of soap] So sorry to interrupt, but I might have a solution that works for everyone!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, yeah!
Bubble Buddy: Yeah!
SpongeBob: [pops out a variety of bubble wands] Let's blow this popsicle stand. [laughs]
[The scene changes to newly blow Bubbletown. Bubbletown now has a new location that looks almost similar to the Krusty Krab in Bikini Bottom. It is known as the Bubbly Krab. The bubble groom drives away with Amy, his newly wedded bubble wife. In the Bubbly Krab, SpongeBob is wearing a bubble hat similar to the hat he wears at the Krusty Krab and is holding a bubble spatula.]
Bubble Buddy: I can't believe how quickly you inflated the whole city again, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yep! The whole city. Plus this new Krusty Krab. [shows all the bubble customers eating Bubble Patties]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs as he is counting bubble money in the Bubbly Krab cash register] Yeah! Franchisin's a great idea, boy-o! [opens the bubble cash register and pops out bubble money] I am making money claw over fist here. [stuffs the bubble money in the bubble cash register] Hey, what's the exchange rate for bubbles to real money?
Bubble Buddy: There is none! [laughs along with SpongeBob]
[All the bubble customers laugh as well.]
Bubble customers: Exchange rate? [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That's it. We're done here. [pops the Bubbly Krab, picks up SpongeBob, and leaves Bubbletown in disgust]
SpongeBob: Huh. [giggles]
[Bubble ducks walk by with a little bubble boy.]
Little bubble boy: I wuv to learn!


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The customers are crowding in front of the little window. Bubble Bass is sitting on Squidward and Squidward struggles to free himself from the bottom.]
Squidward: [grunts as he tries to free himself] You people are proof that evolution can go in reverse!
Customers: Shh!
[The customers watch as SpongeBob juggles the Krabby Patties and roll them onto the grill. Three patties remain spinning until SpongeBob "shoots" them flat like shooting a gun.]
Customers: Ooh! Ahh!
[SpongeBob sprays ketchup and mustard on the buns. He bangs on the grill and sends the patties flying. Then he makes six perfect Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[The customers applaud for SpongeBob's talented performance.]
Bubble Bass: Ooh, impressive! That's most impressive!
[Mr. Krabs comes in.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, why aren't these walking wallets spending money?
Squidward: [grunts and talks muffled] Because they're too busy watching SpongeBob cook!
Mr. Krabs: What? [climbs onto Squidward]
Squidward: [gets stepped on by Mr. Krabs] Ow!
[Mr. Krabs climbs onto the customers and take a peak in the kitchen. SpongeBob is spraying ketchup and mustard on the buns.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm. Well, he's not exactly maximerizing his worktime with those flourishes. But, boy, does that boy-o have talent. [his eyes become light bulbs with dollar signs on them; he turns them on with his nose] Ding! [climbs down and grabs a mallet] And talent equals money!
[The customers turn and run as they see Mr. Krabs preparing to smash a hole in the wall. Squidward screams and runs away as well. Mr. Krabs smashes the wall really hard and makes a massive hole between the kitchen and the dining room. SpongeBob finishes his juggling act and turns around. He becomes startled to see the massive hole Mr. Krabs made.]
SpongeBob: I have X-ray vision! I can see through walls!
Mr. Krabs: Calm your waters, lad. I just knocked it down.
SpongeBob: [jibbers] Why'd you do that?
Mr. Krabs: In the restaurant business, it's called an open kitchen so the customers can watch the cook cook.
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I don't think I can take that kind of pressure.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense. You're a born performer. [looks around and sees a closet] Ooh! [carries SpongeBob to the closet] Here. [takes out a pen, opens it, and draws a star on it] You even got your own dressing room. See? Huh? Huh?
[A Krabby Patty falls from the shelf. SpongeBob runs in and locks the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? Uh... [jiggles the doorknob] Come on, boy-o, it's showtime!
SpongeBob: [whimpers as he looks through the mop on his head] I can't! I've got stage fright!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, if you don't come out, you're fired!
[SpongeBob reluctantly comes out of the closet and feels nervous.]
Mr. Krabs: There he is! [flicks SpongeBob's hat off and gives him a toque] ChefBob! [grabs SpongeBob and closes the closet with his foot] Me little star! [pushes SpongeBob to the grill] Break a leg. Break two legs.
Fred: [holds up his leg] My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Shut up, Fred! [makes his leave] Ta-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
[The customers cheer. SpongeBob is really nervous and unsure about this open kitchen business. He grabs a patty and he wipes the sweat off his head.]
Customers: Ooh!
[SpongeBob puts the patty onto the grill, but accidentally burns it. He grabs a bun filled with mustard and puts the burnt patty on it. He puts his shoe and a bar of soap on the patty. SpongeBob presents it and the customers seem confused.]
Harold Reginald: What?
[Now Mr. Krabs is getting a little nervous, but keeps his cool by smiling.]
Fred: That's just wrong!
[SpongeBob grabs a tube of toothpaste and smears it on the patty. The customers are still confused.]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, boy-o! Razzle-dazzle them!
[SpongeBob hides under the grill trying to think of a solution to his stage fright problem.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what do I do? What do I do? [sees a paper bag] Huh? Oh!
[SpongeBob grabs the bag and makes it into a small little puppet version of himself, ChefBob. He slowly shows the puppet to the customers and Mr. Krabs. The customers are amazed at it.]
ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
[The customers shrug in confusion. The couldn't figure out how to respond to it. One customer was gnawing on his hand.]
Dave: I guess I am.
ChefBob: Welcome, welcome to my job in the kitchen of ChefBob! I cook and dance, I wear square pants, cooking for this hungry mob! [singsong] Your order, please!
[The customers cheer and SpongeBob is happy.]
Mr. Krabs: [rubs his claws together] The little ChefBob is a sensation.
[The scene changes to all of the customers gathering around to see the ChefBob show Mr. Krabs put up. ChefBob comes out from the curtain.]
ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
Customers: We are!
[ChefBob grabs some patties and juggles them. and roll them onto the grill. Three patties remain spinning until SpongeBob "shoots" them flat like shooting a gun just like how SpongeBob did earlier. SpongeBob grins happily at ChefBob's performance. ChefBob flips three patties and grabs one with a whip. He gives the patty to a cowboy and stamps a picture of himself with a branding iron.]
ChefBob: Huh?
[The scene changes to ChefBob playing magic tricks with the patties. He pulls a patty from Jennifer Millie and Clay's ears.]
ChefBob: Ha, ho! Ha, ho! Voilà!
[ChefBob throws the patties on the grill after they bounced onto Squidward's nose.]
ChefBob: Ta-da!
[The customers cheer.]
Clay: [looks at his watch] Oh-ho! Look at the time. I gotta get home and get my beauty sleep.
Squidward: Oh, what died on that guy's neck? Oh, it's his head.
[Squidward's insult was accidentally heard out loud by ChefBob.]
ChefBob: Huh?
[ChefBob comes up with an idea. He thinks that he could use insults to make himself popular. He slides over to Clay just as he was about to leave.]
ChefBob: Hey, what died on your neck? Oh, it's your head!
[The customers laugh, but Squidward is offended by it. Clay felt embarrassed at first, but laughs along with the customers.]
Squidward: Oh, that little plagiarist. That was my line.
Clay: [laughs] Obviously, the sleep hasn't been helping! [makes a hideous face as he laughs]
[SpongeBob becomes shocked at what he just heard.]
SpongeBob: D-did I say that? I didn't say that.
Jennifer Mille: [laughs and grabs ChefBob] Hey, do me! Insult me!
ChefBob: Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?
Jennifer Mille: [laughs] That was a good one.
ChefBob: [gets grabbed by SpongeBob] Huh? Oh!
SpongeBob: ChefBob, we don't speak like that to our customers.
Harold (red fish): Me next! [ChefBob goes back up] Shoot me a zinger!
ChefBob: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get that. [shoots an arrow on Harold's head] I don't speak "goober!"
[The paper with the word "Goober" rolls down and the customers laugh.]
Harold (red fish): [laughs] I love it! Guilty as charged! [laughs and sheds a tear]
[The customers yell out at ChefBob to make more insults and give him money and jewels. He even gives them their autographs for their books and their children.]
Squidward: Oh, great. I've created a monster. A funny, talented monster.
[The scene changes to ChefBob powdering his nose in his dressing room.]
Mr. Krabs: Ho, ho, ho, ho! [flicks money] Oh, I gotta hand it to ya! That new insult comedy act is really bringing in the money!
[SpongeBob, with a sad look on his face, turns around and gives Mr. Krabs a paper.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, what's this, here?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. It's a list of things ChefBob needs for his little dressing room.
Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho, does he? [reads the list] "Fresh cut seaweed." [his smile turns upside-down] "A manicurist for SpongeBob's puppet hand?" What? [gets angry] "A bigger dressing room?"
ChefBob: In the meantime, we'll just take over your office, Blubber Boy.
Mr. Krabs: Blubber Boy?! [his belly blubbers; he lowers his shirt and rips up the paper] No way! [stomps the paper bits on the ground]
ChefBob: [grabs Mr. Krabs] What's the matter, Krabs? [flicks his nose] You don't like money? [whacks Mr. Krabs in the face with money]
[Mr. Krabs takes the money and puts them in the bag.]
Mr. Krabs: [weepy] What?... Of course I like money. The office will be ready in five minutes. [leaves]
SpongeBob: ChefBob, I think your insults are mean and hurtful. What do you say we just go back to the Krabby Patty routines, huh?
ChefBob: Need I remind you that my insults pay your salary?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.
[SpongeBob and ChefBob leave the closet.]
Squidward: ChefBob, you stole my line! I do all the insults around here!
ChefBob: [grabs Squidward's hand] Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. You're absolutely right.
Squidward: Um, oh, well, uh, thank you. It's—it's—it's really not such a big deal.
ChefBob: Let me make it up to ya! [grabs Squidward and drags him and SpongeBob outside] Hi, everybody! I'd like to introduce you to a very good friend of mine: Squidward Tentacles!
[The customers cheer.]
Squidward: Huh? Oh, no. Please, please, you're to—you're too kind.
ChefBob: I was gonna ask Squidward how old he was, but then I remembered he can't count that high!
Squidward: [dumbfounded] Huh?
[ChefBob sprays water in Squidward's eye and the customers laugh at his humiliation. Squidward shrinks down nervously and pops.]
SpongeBob: [growls] Alright, that's it! You can't talk to Squidward that way! He is one of my best friends!
Squidward: [reappears next to Mr. Krabs] That's even more insulting.
ChefBob: Get a load of him, folks! He must've been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen! [grabs a rubber chicken and hits SpongeBob with it]
[The customers laugh. SpongeBob grabs the rubber chicken and goes to whack ChefBob with it, but ends up hitting Nat Peterson.]
Nat Peterson: Ow! Not funny!
[SpongeBob and ChefBob both get into a fight. ChefBob flings SpongeBob to a table and crash onto it. The customers continue to think this is part of the act and continue to laugh. ChefBob grabs SpongeBob, swings him around and flings him to the bathroom.]
Jimmy Gus: He scores!
[The customers rush into the bathroom.]
Fred: Yeah, yeah! Fight in the bathroom!
[ChefBob is trying to push SpongeBob down the toilet.]
ChefBob: Have a drink!
[SpongeBob struggles to get up, but ChefBob pushes him down the toilet. SpongeBob pulls the lever, hoping to flush ChefBob down along with him.]
ChefBob: No, no! [grabs the lever but gets flushed down the toilet]
[The customers become worried now that SpongeBob and ChefBob are flushed. In the kitchen, SpongeBob and ChefBob emerge from the sink and crash into a box of spatulas. SpongeBob and ChefBob engage in a spatula sword fight.]
SpongeBob: En garde!
[SpongeBob and ChefBob fight each other with all their might. They exit the kitchen and continue their fight in the dining room while the customers watch. ChefBob removes the spatula from SpongeBob's grasp and goes to finish him. SpongeBob holds his ground and keeps ChefBob's spatula from hitting him. ChefBob cackles evilly as if he was about to win. Just as ChefBob was about to deliver the final blow, SpongeBob lifts ChefBob, grabs the spatula with his teeth, and throws it onto a poster in the wall. SpongeBob hops in the boat, opens the cash register and slams the drawer onto ChefBob. The customers gasp in fright and realize that SpongeBob and ChefBob's battle is not part of the act and is not funny at all. The parent and the child cry at the sight. The customers become disgusted with this and they leave the restaurant just as SpongeBob collapses from exhaustion.]
Mr. Krabs: Me customers! [gets angry and walks over to ChefBob, who's punching SpongeBob] Alright, enough of this. [grabs ChefBob off of SpongeBob's hand and holds up a hand puppet version of himself]
Hand puppet Mr. Krabs: ChefBob, you are hereby fired! [punches ChefBob to the floor] Mr. Squidward, will you do the honors?
[Squidward holds up a hand puppet version of himself.]
Hand puppet Squidward: [picks up ChefBob] Let me help you slip into something more comfortable. Like the gutter!
[Squidward kicks ChefBob out the door. ChefBob gets run over by a boat, trampled on by a little girl's pogo stick, and swept away by a street cleaner.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I learned a very valuable lesson today.
Hand puppet Mr. Krabs: To always be yourself and not hide behind a puppet?
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, that, but [holds up his swollen hand] mostly don't slam your puppet hand in a register drawer. [his hand thumps]
[SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs all share a laugh together.]
SpongeBob: Ow.
[The scene changes to the next day. Squidward screams at something on the television.]
SpongeBob: [overlapping] What is it, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs: [overlapping] What is it, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: It's—it's alive! [points to the television]
TV Announcer: And now, it's time for the ChefBob Cooking with Insults Show! And here's your host, ChefBob!
ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
[The live action audience cheers.]
ChefBob: Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?
[The live action audience cheer once more.]
ChefBob: Yay, yeah! Yay, yeah!
[SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are completely shocked and they all faint to the floor. The curtains close and the words "The End" appear on the screen, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is marching around like a military drill sergeant while wearing a solider helmet.]
Mr. Krabs: Now, we all know what this day is.
SpongeBob: Today is the day when Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, sir! [continuously whacks Squidward with the mop while talking]
Squidward: [angrily] Like he does every day. [takes the mop from the scared SpongeBob who realizes his error]
Mr. Krabs: But this time, he's not going to catch me with me spatula down! [laughs] Ooh? [flips his spatula right side-up] SpongeBob, you're on guard duty, boy!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs! [hops in the mop wringer bucket and heads to the front door]
Squidward: And I'll go undercover. [grabs a pillow and a blanket and goes to sleep as usual]
[Mr. Krabs glares down at Squidward before hearing SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Hup, two, three, four! Hup, two, three, four! ♪Krabby Patties are the best! They'll put hair on your chest!♪
[A female customer looks into her dress and hair pops out.]
Female customer: [gasps] Oh!
French Narrator: Three hours later...
[SpongeBob is very tired from patrolling the front door.]
SpongeBob: [weakly] ♪Krabby Patties are the best... They'll put hairs...into your nest♪ [flops down to the floor]
[Squidward wakes up from his "undercover" and gets whacked with the mop.]
Squidward: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: [picks SpongeBob up] Any sign of Plankton?
SpongeBob: Uh, afraid not, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Maybe he's on vacation.
Mr. Krabs: Don't be silly! We always take our trips together, [his eyestalk enlarges at Squidward] to keep an eye on each other. What's taking that crook so long? [looks at his watch] Hm... Maybe the door is stuck. [oils the hinges on the door and sees a line of customers coming] Ah, for—these customers are blocking the way! [flips the road and sends the customers hurling into passing garbage truck; sighs] There we go. Nice, open path. [his path is nice and sparkly] Hm? Mm... Hey! Well, maybe he just needs a little incentive. [cuts to the Krusty Krab displaying the secret formula on a pillow; the sign blinkers the words "Secret Formula" with arrows pointing at it] There we go. [peaks over the cash register and looks at his watch; he slowly begins to worry] Maybe he doesn't want me formula anymore. [gasps as he sees the formula missing] He took the bait! We're going to red alert! [pushes the alarm button and the alarm goes off; the lights in the restaurant blink red and blue; then it covers itself with a protective shield and spins into the ground. Mr. Krabs peaks out of the ground through the telescope] Batten down the hatches! Furl the deck! Stop that greedy green goober!
[The customers moan and groan from all the spinning. SpongeBob runs around with a pile of bricks. He trips over Nat Peterson and sends the bricks flying to the window. Squidward dodges the bricks.]
Squidward: [sighs in relief but gets hit in the face with the brick] Ow.
[SpongeBob bends the kitchen door down, wraps it up and stuffs it in his head.]
Patrick: Doggone it! [shakes the bottle with the secret formula] Can I get some ketchup over here? Please?
Mr. Krabs: [slides down the rail while SpongeBob walks the dazed Squidward.]False alarm.
[The restaurant comes back out of the ground. The customers recover from the spinning and quickly run out due to motion sickness.]
Whistle: [blowing] Closing time!
[SpongeBob and Squidward remove their hats and prepare to go home. Mr. Krabs jumps in front of them, blocks the door and grabs his employees.]
Mr. Krabs: And just where do you think you two are going?
Squidward: [pulls himself free] It's customary to go home at closing time.
SpongeBob: Aren't you going home, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [puts SpongeBob down and laughs] Oh, I'm not budging. Plankton is gonna try something. I don't know when. I don't know where.
Squidward: Probably...here.
Mr. Krabs: Well, yeah. But when he does, I'll be waiting for him. [cackles and rubs his claws in a greedy motion]
[SpongeBob and Squidward exit the front door and quietly leave. Mr. Krabs turns off the light.]
Mr. Krabs: I'll be waiting right here.
French Narrator: The next morning...
SpongeBob: [enters the restaurant] Morning! Hm? [takes his hat while Squidward takes his] I guess Mr. Krabs went home after all.
Mr. Krabs: No, I'm still here... [reveals himself to be camouflaged to the floor] Waiting for that blasted Plankton!
[SpongeBob and Squidward become startled with Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs gets up. His eyestalks shrink to look like chameleon eyes and rolls away. The scene changes to Squidward trying to take a customer's order.]
Customer: Yeah, I'll take—
Mr. Krabs: [opens the customer's mouth] Me patty formula?! Huh? I knew it! You in there, Plankton?! [shakes the bones out of the customer's body]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, that's not Plankton!
[The customer's whole skeleton falls out of the body. Mr. Krabs drops the customer's body.]
Customer: [gets up and grabs his body, now angry] I will never set foot in this establishment again! [whacks Mr. Krabs with his skeleton foot for his actions] From now on, I'm using the drive-thru! [leaves]
[Mr. Krabs gasps and sees Mrs. Puff walking out with a Krabby Patty. He fishes Mrs. Puff with the fishing hook.]
Mr. Krabs: Aha! Trying to sneak a Krabby Patty to Plankton, eh? [takes the patty from Mrs. Puff]
Mrs. Puff: But, Eugene, it's just a to-go order.
Mr. Krabs: [mocking gibberish] Well, from now on, all patties are to be eaten on the premises! [sets Mrs. Puff down]
Squidward: What are you gonna do now, ban pockets?
Mr. Krabs: Capital idea, Mr. Squidward.
[Mr. Krabs uses a reef blower to steal money from a customer's pockets. It even sucked up his clothes. Mr. Krabs puts a barrel onto the customer's body.]
Mr. Krabs: There'll be a $50-a-barrel surcharge from now on! [sucks in more clothes and money with the reef blower and gives them more barrels; Old Man Walker is about to leave, but Mr. Krabs stops him] Whoa, hey, slow down there, Grandpa. Let me see here. [scans him with the scanner, removes his hat and reveals a stack of patties on his hat] Aha! Another one of Plankton's spies!
Old Man Walker: [nervously] I just wanted some for later.
Mr. Krabs: [violently stamps him with a "BANNED" stamper] You're banned! [kicks him out and sees a baby sucking on a Krabby Patty] Hm... So Plankton's recruiting baby burglars now! [removes the patty from the baby's mouth and the baby cries] Put a cork in it! [stuffs the baby's mouth with a cork and shoves both the baby and the mother in a barrel that says, "BANNED"] You're banned! [continues to violently stamp the customers with the "BANNED" stamper] You! You're banned! You're banned! Banned! [one customer's head gets a nasty bump from the stamper] Banned! [Tom's teeth say the word, "BANNED"; Mr. Krabs lifts his restaurant and bashes the customers away; he speaks through the Krusty Krab sign] You're all banned! [barricades the door while breathing heavily]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't think Plankton's coming.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense! [hears a knock at the door and gasps] See? It's that stinker Plankton now! What do you want?
Sandy: [off-screen] Uh...A Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: [Suspicious]Why?
Sandy: [off-screen] I'm hungry.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, that's just Sandy.
Mr. Krabs: [peeks through the hole and sees Sandy waving innocently] I'm not falling for it. [sticks his eyestalk through the hole and looks at Sandy] That's the worst squirrel suit I've ever seen. [shakes a spray can and sprays the word "BANNED" on Sandy's suit; gibbers as he begins to lose his sanity]
SpongeBob: [feeling a bit creeped out by Mr. Krabs' behavior; whispers to Squidward] Do you think Mr. Krabs is acting...strange?
[Mr. Krabs climbs up the ceiling, snaps his claws, and his mouth foams while he gibbers.]
Squidward: He seems fine to me.
SpongeBob: [whispers] Maybe we should postpone our plans for tonight.
Mr. Krabs: Plans?! Aha! You're both working for Plankton! Get out of me restaurant you tricky treacherous traitors! [violently stamps them with the "BANNED" stamper and sends them flying out of the restaurant]
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab chained and barricade. Mr. Krabs is hiding underneath the register boat while protecting the Krabby Patty formula. It appears that Mr. Krabs has completely lost his mind and is completely losing full sanity of himself.]
Mr. Krabs: I know you're in here, Plankton. Where are you hiding?
Plankton: [off-screen] I'm right here... [Mr. Krabs jumps out and sees the television on] at the Chum Bucket! Come on down and try our new Chum Nuggets.
Mr. Krabs: Heh. [turns off the television] Whew. [sees Plankton's shadow and gasps; he hides behind a pole; he looks and sees that is was only a cup with two straws] Oh. [chuckles] Just a—just a cup.
[Mr. Krabs hallucinates when he sees the cup transform into Plankton. Plankton laughs evilly and Mr. Krabs becomes scared. Everywhere he looks, he sees everything transform into various images of Plankton, laughing at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs runs to escape, but no matter how he attempts to escape, all of the images of Plankton keep following him while laughing. Mr. Krabs crawls into a hole, which turns into Plankton's eyeball and reveals a red demonic version of Plankton holding the secret formula while laughing. Back in reality, Mr. Krabs is completely losing himself and screams. He runs to the bathroom and goes to wash his face at the sink.]
Mr. Krabs: [washes his face] Get ahold of yourself. Get ahold of yourself. [turns off the faucet and sighs] I'm starting to see things. [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs hallucinates as he is seeing his eyestalks transform into Plankton.He screams and gibbers. He runs up the pole with the formula and pops out from the ceiling. Just then, he notices something going on at the Chum Bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [pulls out a telescope and sees SpongeBob and Squidward entering the Chum Bucket] Those two are working for Plankton! [gasps as he sees Sandy, Mrs. Puff, Patrick, and Pearl enter the Chum Bucket]
Pearl: [bumps into the door] Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Me own daughter? [sheds a tear and sees Old Man Jenkins enter the Chum Bucket too] Oh, not Old Man Jenkins! [cries violently and goes back into the restaurant] Everyone really is out to get you. Aren't they, my little formula?
[Suddenly, the doorbell rings. Mr. Krabs goes up to the door and peaks through the hole. He sees SpongeBob standing out there.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? You have got to come with me to...[reads a note] the Chum Bucket for Plankton has kidnapped Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, so that's Plankton's evil plan? He wants me formula as ransom! What do we do? What? What's that? [leans in the bottle closely as if it was talking to him] Oh, that's just brilliant! Hold on a minute. I'll go get the ransom. [goes into the kitchen] Oh, you want a Krabby Patty, do you? Well, I'll give you a Krabby Patty. [laughs maniacally as he stuffs a variety of dangerous objects into the patties and cooks them on the grill; he makes a whole plateful of Krabby Patties; he goes to grab them, but they spark; Mr. Krabs checks them to see if they'll ignite, but nothing happens; he grabs the plate and laughs evilly; he kicks open the door] Okay, let's go rescue Squidward. [laughs]
[SpongeBob lifts the door up and appears to be flat. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk over to the Chum Bucket. They enter the restaurant and see Squidward tied up to a chair and gagged. Plankton appears on Squidward's head.]
Plankton: [giggles evilly] Surprised, Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Not at all, Sheldon. I knew you were up to something.
Plankton: Oh, yeah? How about now? [pulls out a remote and pushes the button]
[The lights turn on and all of Mr. Krabs' friends and family jump out.]
Everyone: Surprise!
[Mr. Krabs screams in surprise. He then becomes confused.]
Plankton: Oh, come, Krabs. It's the anniversary of the first time I tried to steal your Krabby Patty formula!
SpongeBob: [places a cake on top of Plankton] So, we threw you a surprise party.
Mr. Krabs: [teary-eyed] You mean you weren't working for Plankton?!
SpongeBob: Of course not, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [sheds a tear] Oh, I shouldn't have suspected you, SpongeBob! Whew. Won't need these anymore. [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs sets the plateful of Krabby Patties down and hugs SpongeBob. All of his friends and family members forgive Mr. Krabs for his actions.]
Patrick: Oh, boy, Krabby Patties! [grabs the plate]
Sandy: Yee-haw!
[Mr. Krabs sees them go to eat the tainted patties and screams. He knows what's gonna happen if they take a bite out of them. So, he rushes over to protect them all. Mrs. Puff goes to eat the patty.]
Mr. Krabs: No! Don't eat the patties! [snatches the patty from Mrs. Puff] Gotcha. [two jellyfish come out from the patty and sting his eyestalks]
[Mr. Krabs grabs the patty from Patrick who bites his hand. A foothold trap clamps down on his eyestalks. He screams in pain. He grabs the patty from Sandy, Squidward, and Old Man Jenkins.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew. [his destructive patties ignite and squirt tartar sauce on him] Ah, tartar sauce!
[The patties spin Mr. Krabs around and launch him into the air. The patties explode into a fireworks display, showing images of Mr. Krabs himself in pain. Everyone gazes at the spectacular fireworks display as if Mr. Krabs is putting on a show for them. Mr. Krabs comes back down and crashes onto the floor, completely burned.]
Mr. Krabs: [dizzy] Yay. [crumbles to ashes]
[It appears that Mr. Krabs got what he deserved for being a paranoid jerk, banning everyone from the restaurant, causing physical harm, and for letting his insane behavior put his own business in jeopardy. The scene changes to the aftermath of the anniversary party. Everyone exits the Chum Bucket and wave good-bye. But Squidward, on the other hand, is still tied to the chair as he hops along.]
Squidward: A little help here!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs leave the Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs is now wrapped in bandages and is wearing a cast on his right arm.]
SpongeBob: Did you enjoy the surprise party, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, I'll tell you in a second. [turns SpongeBob around to see the Chum Bucket]
[Meanwhile, inside, Plankton chews through the cake and pops out the top.]
Plankton: [spits some cake out] Huh? [sees the formula] Ooh, that fool Krabs left the Krabby Patty formula behind! [knocks over the bottle, opens it and pulls the paper out; he sees a stick of dynamite flaring up in the bottle] Mommy.
[The dynamite explodes and destroys the Chum Bucket.]
SpongeBob: Ooh.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, boy-o. I enjoyed it very much. [laughs as the debris of the Chum Bucket fall from above]


[The episode begins with Patrick watching a cartoon that involves with a sea urchin getting pummeled by a dimwitted snail. The snail bashes the sea urchin with a vase.]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits the sea urchin with a shoe]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits the sea urchin with a refrigerator]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
[Patrick laughs hysterically and carries his television over to SpongeBob's house. Patrick bumps into the front door and gets his face squished. He pulls his face off the screen.]
TV Announcer: Wow! It's the "Sir Urchin and Snail Fail" show!
Patrick: It's cartoon time, SpongeBob! [enters SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? [looks all over the living and goes upstairs] SpongeBob? [he sees SpongeBob exit his library] SpongeRobert?
SpongeBob: Oh! It's cartoon time! I'll get our "Sir Urchin" hats. [gets pulled back by Patrick] Whoa.
Patrick: Not so fast, SpongeBob. What's in the secret room?
SpongeBob: It's not a secret room, Patrick. It's my library.
Patrick: W-what's that word mean?
SpongeBob: A library is a...playground for your mind. [pokes his brain out and pulls it back]
[Patrick daydreams about playing on the playground with his brain.]
Patrick: [laughs and grabs the television] Let's do it! It's library time! [throws the television down the stairs]
Sir Urchin and Snail Fail: Ow! Ow! [crashes off-screen]
Snail Fail: What I do?
[In the library, Gary is reading a "Cooking without Salt" cookbook. Patrick is laughing and kicks some pillows in a goofy fashion. He climbs on the ladder and rides around on it. He bumps into SpongeBob and lands on Gary's chair, scaring him. Gary angrily hisses at Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [straightens himself out] Oh, tender, naïve Patrick, it's not that kind of playground. It's a place to read books! See?
Patrick: Oh, I love books! [laughs and throws books around] Book! Book! [SpongeBob dodges the incoming books] Book!
SpongeBob: [whispers] Gary, I don't think Patrick knows how to use a book properly. [gets hit in the face by a book] Ow! [removes the book and grabs Patrick] Behold the books, Patrick. Each one has a story to tell.
Patrick: Whoa.
SpongeBob: Look out! Those books are cliffhangers, stories for the adventurous.
[Two books are clinging for their lives on the shelf. Patrick panics and rushes to help them.]
Patrick: I'll save you! [climbs on the shelf] Whoa! [falls down and gets crushed underneath]
SpongeBob: [pulls Patrick out and shows a log-shaped book] There are logbooks, [holds up a really large book entitled, "War and Peace"] unabridged books, [shows a pop-up book that displays London's Tower Bridge] and books with bridges.
Patrick: Whoa! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [puts a book close to his ear] Listen to the soothing sounds of the audiobooks. [hears seagulls cawing and ocean waves] I can hear the ocean.
[Patrick grabs a book and hears a toilet flushing.]
Patrick: Me too!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
SpongeBob: Cookbooks, for the culinarily curious.
[Patrick takes a page that has a picture of a turkey on it. He puts it on a stove, fries it up, and eats it.]
Patrick: I like the pictures.
SpongeBob: [reaches in Patrick's mouth and grabs the page] Ah, but the pictures are a mere snack! [closes the book and puts it away] It's the words in the book that really feeds your brain. Let's start you off with an old book. [takes an old book that is covered in cobwebs and dust; he parachutes down and opens the book; and eerie dust bunny appears and SpongeBob sniffs it up] Ah, musty old books smell. Now, read the words, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, read the—oh, uh..."Once...Upon a..." "Once upon a..." Once upon a what?!
SpongeBob: To continue the story, you have to turn the page. [turns a page]
Patrick: Oh. "Time." "Once upon a time!" [laughs and turns pages] That's the most amazing trick I've ever seen! I want to stare at more words!
SpongeBob: Then feast your eyes!
[SpongeBob turns the pages and Patrick goes to read. Inside Patrick's head, his brain is sitting alone on the couch, feeling bored. It picks its nose and smears it on the arm rest. It then sees Patrick looking at the words in the book he's reading.]
Patrick: Once upon a time...
[While Patrick is reading, the words "Once upon a time" fly in through his eye sockets and pile up on his brain.]
Patrick: [continues to read while SpongeBob is turning the pages] Once a— You're too slow! [pushes SpongeBob away and reads through the book]
SpongeBob: He likes it! Hey, Patrick!
[As Patrick continues to read, more words flow into his brain. The brain sniffs at the words and comes up with an idea. It gathers the words together and uses them to build a house. Once it's complete, it reads "Home Sweet Home." It enters its house, but more words pile up as Patrick continuously reads books. As Patrick continues to read, his head begins to swell up.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, Patrick, your head is absorbing all the book knowledge just like a sponge! [laughs]
[Patrick's brain is building more houses out of the words that flow into Patrick's head.]
SpongeBob: [laughs and bangs on books like drums] Go, Patrick! Get those words! Get them good!
[Patrick uses his eyeballs to page through the books in a fast pace and SpongeBob drums really hard. Patrick's brain builds more buildings. Patrick's eyes suck up all the until he starts getting tired.]
Patrick: Stop reading words! [his pupils page through the book as his head swells]
SpongeBob: Wow, what a bookworm! [sees Patrick's swelled up head] Whoa.
Patrick: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, I think that's enough knowledge for one day. Looks like you're full.
Patrick: Nonsense, dear boy. One can never accumulate too much information. [whips his face with a napkin] Ahem.
SpongeBob: Well, we're fresh out of books. Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream.
Patrick: Ah, I must confess to feeling more than slightly peckish.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm so proud of you! Ooh, you're a big brain now!
[Patrick attempts to leave, but his enormous head gets him stuck to the door.]
Patrick: Oh, skosh too big, it seems, eh, wha'?
SpongeBob: "Eh, wha" what?
Patrick: [laughs] Oh, no matter, my plebeian friend. I shall simply exit posthaste, posterior-first. [attempts to exit backwards, but ends up getting stuck]
SpongeBob: I got it. [pushes Patrick]
Patrick: Careful.
SpongeBob: Little bit... [pushes Patrick] Wow. You really got your melon jammed in there, didn't you?
Patrick: Oh, true, SpongeBob. Eh, but we can easily solve this problem on a quantum physics level. Take this down. If we reduce my subatomic particles by way of orbital electromagnetism, we'll create a harmonic oscillation within the molecules, resulting in a wave-function collapse, which will enable my "melon," as you so drolly put it, to slip out.
[As Patrick spoke, simple mathematics appear from his head and swirl around SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Okay, sure. Let's give it a try. [puts various parts together and creates a machine; he stick the suction plugs on to Patrick's head; then he creates sound waves to help shrink Patrick's head, but the waves bounce back and hit Gary, causing him to shrink and multiply into little snails] Gary! Speak to me. Oh... [gathers the little snails and forms Gary back to his normal self] Oh, Gary you're back. I'd know that slime anywhere. [gasps] Slime! That's it! [laughs] Slime it up, Gar-bear.
[Gary slithers slime all over Patrick's head.]
Patrick: Abominable!
SpongeBob: Yeah, that Gary grease ought to do it. Okay, Patrick, pull yourself out.
[Patrick attempts to pull himself out, but with no success. SpongeBob tries to help him, but Patrick's swelled up head sends him flying into one of the bookshelves. SpongeBob sees a book about head-shrinking.]
SpongeBob: Hey. "Head Shrinking for Beginners." [reads book] Hm...
[The fireplace builds up the fire. SpongeBob, dressed as a witchdoctor, screams like a chicken. Gary plays the drums in rhythm. Patrick's head is covered in lite candles. SpongeBob chants and dances around like he's performing a ritual. He opens the bottle, drinks the potion and spits it in Patrick's face. But instead of shrinking Patrick's head, SpongeBob's head shrinks.]
SpongeBob: [high-pitched] Oh, I give up! I'll guess we'll have to live here in the library forever, Gary.
[Gary hides behind the drums in fear. SpongeBob cries a fountain of tears and his head goes back to normal.]
Patrick: SpongeBob, your typically moronic attempt has given me the solution! Perhaps because I had to smarten up to get stuck...
SpongeBob: You'll need to dumb down to get free!
Patrick: [laughs] Who's sporting the big brain now, hm? [laughs]
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick! Let's get stupid! Yeah! [gives Patrick a tongue five]
[SpongeBob puts on gloves and goggles. Patrick kicks a book in SpongeBob's face.]
SpongeBob: Electronics.
[SpongeBob collects various pieces of parts and puts them all together to make television set. Once he's done, he places it in front of Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Whew. I hope this works.
[Patrick sighs and SpongeBob turns on the television where the Sir Urchin and Snail Fail show is airing. Snail Fail hits Sir Urchin with a vase.]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits the sea urchin with a shoe]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
Patrick: I'm sorry, dear boy, but watching this mindless drivel isn't affecting me in the least...[gets dazed and starts to drool]
SpongeBob: We've got drool! Patrick, it's working! [holds up the television]
Snail Fail: What I do?
Patrick: [his eyeballs rub against the screen] This is insulting my intelligence. [begins to laugh] And I adore it! [laughs enthusiastically]
[Inside Patrick's head, Patrick's brain hears a loud noise. He turns and sees Sir Urchin and Snail Fail destroying everything it built.]
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits Sir Urchin with a word]
Sir Urchin: [throws a chunk] Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits Sir Urchin with a word]
[Patrick's brain runs to hide somewhere as Sir Urchin and Snail Fail destroy everything. Patrick's head shrinks down to its normal size.]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! The mindless drivel is destroying your knowledge!
[SpongeBob plugs a hose in Patrick's head and sprays the words back into the books. He sprays the words onto the shelves and form brand new books for his library. The hose spits out the last remaining words and Patrick's brain.]
SpongeBob: Whoops. Here, Patrick. You may need this little fella. [puts his brain back into Patrick's head]
Patrick: Huh? Ah.
[Patrick's brain falls onto the couch in his head. It becomes bored again and picks its nose.]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, this is where we came in. Ready for some ice cream?
Patrick: Boy, am I ever! [sees a book on the floor] A book? I love books! [goes back to throwing books] A book! [throws books] A book!
SpongeBob: [dodges the incoming books] That's right, Patrick. [dodges a book] Play nice with the pretty squares. Gary, this is really one for the books, eh? [laughs]
[Gary meows dully in response. SpongeBob laughs, but gets a book thrown in his mouth. He turns to the screen and laughs as he shows the cover of the book entitled, "The End."]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is outside in his boat on the street, waiting for SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [growls impatiently and honks his horn] SpongeBob! [growls and honks his horn again] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [appears on the passenger seat with a pilot helmet on] Oh, boy! Road trip! [fastens his seatbelt] I hope it lasts forever.
[Mr. Krabs drives up to Old Man Jenkins' farm, which is only ten feet away from the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: And we're here.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs head for the barn's entrance.]
SpongeBob: Old Man Jenkins' farm?
[The scarecrow starts to shake and Old Man Jenkins' appears from the shirt's opening.]
Old Man Jenkins: Trespassers!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs scream. Mr. Krabs hides in his shell and SpongeBob hides behind him. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out over Mr. Krabs' eyestalk holes. Old Man Jenkins comes out from scarecrow costume and points his pitchfork at Mr. Krabs' face.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa there, Jenkins! [Old Man Jenkins points his pitchfork further, but Mr. Krabs pushes it back] Pull in your plow! I'm here to pay me grocery bill. [holds up his really long bill] Jenkins here supplies all the Krusty Krab's farm fresh ingredients.
SpongeBob: [as Mr. Krabs' bill extends itself] Ooh. [laughs] Yoo-hoo! Whee! [slides on the bill]
Old Man Jenkins: And I expect to be paid for them.
Mr. Krabs: Well, funny you should mention that. [SpongeBob comes up next to Old Man Jenkins in a farmer lady's outfit] SpongeBob here will be your farm hand until me bill's paid off.
SpongeBob: Farm hand! Oh, boy! [rips off his outfit]
Old Man Jenkins: Dagnabbit! If you think you can—[gets cut off by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, look at the time. Gotta go! Hey, boy-o! [hops into his boat] This should help you with your work! [throws out a sack and drives away]
[The sack hits SpongeBob in the face and it skids him across the ground.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Potatoes?
[The sack opens and reveals Patrick eating all the potatoes.]
Patrick: Pat-tatoes! [shows his mouth full of potatoes]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! We can be farming buddies. [hugs Patrick really tight, which makes him spit out the potatoes]
Old Man Jenkins: Now hold on there, youngin'. I can't just let any dern fools work on my farm.
SpongeBob: Oh, we're not just any dern fools.
[SpongeBob and Patrick dig into their mouths and pull out their certified fools badges.]
Patrick: We're certified fools.
Old Man Jenkins: Hm….Well, better hitch up your britches. 'Cause we got tons of chores to get done before the big barn dance tonight!
[Old Man Jenkins' farm and grain silo laugh and dance around. The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins leading SpongeBob and Patrick to the oyster coop.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. What's first?
Old Man Jenkins: First thing we do is gatherin' pearly eggs from this oyster coop here. The trick is getting them oysters to open up their clams. [rubs gently on the oyster's chin] Coochie coochie coo.
[The oyster laughs and spits out an egg. Old Man Jenkins takes the egg and shows it to SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, shiny.
Patrick: Ooh, aww.
Old Man Jenkins: [puts egg in basket] I'll be back in two shakes of a lamprey's tail to see how you're coming along.
[SpongeBob leans in to do the same trick as Old Man Jenkins did.]
SpongeBob: [rubs gently on the oyster's chin] Uh, coochie coo-coochie…
Oyster: [pouts] Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Okay, that didn't work.
Patrick: SpongeBob, you gotta be more gentle.
[Patrick grabs a crowbar and screams like a crazy maniac. He jumps over and sticks the crowbar in the oyster's mouth. Patrick tries to pry the oyster's mouth open with all his might, but the oyster flips Patrick over.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
[Patrick whirls around in the air and lands on SpongeBob's face. The crowbar lands in Patrick's mouth and falls flat on the ground. SpongeBob's face is flattened and shaped like Patrick's buttocks before popping itself back in shape. The oysters laugh and spit eggs at SpongeBob and Patrick. Old Man Jenkins comes back and sees the basket still empty.]
Old Man Jenkins: Why, you ain't gathered up a single egg!
[SpongeBob comes over with his mouthful of eggs and spits them in the basket.]
SpongeBob: Well, that was egg-citing. [laughs]
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob, and Patrick at the worm hog pen filled with worm hogs.]
Old Man Jenkins: The next chore is to feed the worm hogs.
[SpongeBob pours a bucket full of slop into the worm hog pen and rings the bell with his nose. The worm hogs run up and begin eating their food. Patrick is also eating the food with the worm hogs.]
Patrick: [swallows the slop] Mmm. Slop.
[One little worm hog is trying to eat some of the food and frantically looks for a place to dig in. But Patrick kicks the little worm hog away.]
SpongeBob: Aww. Are you hingry-wungry cutie-wuite hoggy-woggy? [feeds some slop to the little worm hog and laughs] That tickles. [gasps as the little worm hog begins to swallow him whole]
[SpongeBob screams frantically to break free, but the little worm hog spits SpongeBob out and completely swallows him up before belching out his clothes.]
SpongeBob: Uh, could somebody hand me those?
[Old Man Jenkins sighs in disgust. The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob and Patrick with a cow-like jellyfish in the farm.]
Old Man Jenkins: Now, you be gentle when you milk ol' Bessie. [leaves as Bessie moos]
SpongeBob: Don't you worry. I'll take it easy peasy on the old jelly squeezy.
[SpongeBob grabs a bucket, pulls up a stool and attempts to milk jellyfish jelly from Bessie's udder. He grabs it and goes to milk it, but the udder sprays jelly on the floor. SpongeBob tries desperately to figure out how to milk it, but the udder keeps spraying jelly all over the place. SpongeBob, had enough with the udder, grabs it and goes to milk the jelly in the bucket. But the udder builds up so much jelly, that it causes Bessie to get angry and sprays jelly all around.]
Old Man Jenkins: What in tarnation—[gets sprayed by Bessie's jelly]
[Bessie gets really angry and throws a fit by kicking everything. She then kicks SpongeBob and Patrick and sends them flying towards Old Man Jenkins. All three of them crash into the farm's front door.]
Patrick: Mmm, a Jenkin Jelly sandwich! [licks jelly off of Old Man Jenkins]
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins giving SpongeBob and Patrick their final chore outside the farm. Patrick eats some of Bessie's jelly while Old Man Jenkins is talking.]
Old Man Jenkins: Your final chore is harvesting my kelp patch.
SpongeBob: [sees a tiny patch of kelp] Ha, this will be a snap.
Old Man Jenkins: Not that patch. That one! [points to really huge field full of kelp]
SpongeBob: [groans] That'll take forever!
Old Man Jenkins: Not if you use my tractor. [points to his tractor]
SpongeBob: But I don't have a tractor license.
Patrick: I got lots of licenses. [shows off his licenses] Driver's license, fishing license, marriage license. Oh, here it is! Tractor license!
[Patrick drives the tractor through the kelp patch. The tractor makes several bails of kelp from the back.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick. You're really good at this.
Patrick: The secret is to stay cool as a sea cucumber. I don't want anything to distract—[shouts as he sees a jellybee flying over him] A bee! [screams] Jellybee! [babbles as he tries to shoo it away, but since there is no one steering the wheel, the tractor begins driving around uncontrollably] Get it off, get it off, get it off!
[The tractor trips over a rock and flips around. The jellybee is now sitting on the tractor's steering wheel.]
SpongeBob: Hold on, buddy. [grabs a rope from under the seat] I got it. [throws the rope] Hyah! [misses as it catches the steering wheel] Whoops. [the jellybee flies into SpongeBob's nose, but SpongeBob holds it closed so it won't fly out] Got it.
Patrick: Yay! Don't let it go. [stupidly throws SpongeBob out]
[SpongeBob lands on the ground and gets dragged around by the tractor.]
SpongeBob: [spits out sand] Hey, this is fun.
[The tractor continues to drive while making some kelp bails. SpongeBob skids across the field and dodges the kelp bails.]
SpongeBob: [laughs while dodging the kelp bails] Whoo-hoo!
[The jellybee flies out from one of SpongeBob's holes and stings him from behind. SpongeBob screams in pain and flips over to the front of the tractor in slow-motion. SpongeBob gets caught in the tractor's grinders and comes out all tied up.]
SpongeBob: Did I "bail" out too soon? [laughs and breaks free] Oh, boy! Our chores are all done. It's time for the...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Barn dance!
[The tractor drives into Old Man Jenkins' farm and destroys it.]
Old Man Jenkins: How can I have a barn dance with no barn? [sobs]
SpongeBob: Don't you worry your little wrinkly head. 'Cause we're gonna have an old fashioned barn raising.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob holding a barn baby as he rocks it. Patrick fills a baby bottle with nails and gives it to SpongeBob. SpongeBob feeds the barn baby the bottle of nails.]
Patrick: Aww, wee, wee, wee. [gently rubs the barn baby's chin] Coochie coochie coo.
[The barn baby belches out nails. SpongeBob and Patrick are now covered in nails, but it didn't hurt them.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aww.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob reading a book to the barn kid while Patrick paints red paint on its siding.]
SpongeBob: [reading] "'A' is for Amoeba. 'B' is for Blobfish."
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick and the barn kid playing catch. The barn kid throws the ball at SpongeBob. SpongeBob throws it to Patrick. Patrick throws it back to the barn kid, but it misses as it crashes into the window of Old Man Jenkins' house.]
Old Man Jenkins' house: Oh! You dang kids!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins standing in front of a newly made farm.]
SpongeBob: Congratulations on your barn-mitzvah. Today you are a man-barn.
Patrick: Mazel tov!
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Aw, they grow up so fast. [blows his nose]
[The scene changes to nighttime. Old Man Jenkins' new farm is ready for the barn dance. SpongeBob turns on the flashlight and sticks it onto Bessie. Bessie moos happily and floats up to the ceiling. She then starts to spin around like a disco ball.]
SpongeBob: Perfect! [Patrick is eating a bucket of worm hog slop] Hey, Patrick. You know what time it is?
Patrick: [pulls his head out of the bucket] Time to put on my ham boots? [points to his feet standing on two hams]
[One worm hog squeals and runs away.]
SpongeBob: Nope! It's time to...[opens the front door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Partay! [sees no one there] Hmm?
[The wind blows and a tumbleweed rolls by.]
Patrick: Where is everybody?
SpongeBob: When are your other guests coming, Old Man Jenkins?
Old Man Jenkins: [spraying jelly out from Bessie's udder] Hmm? [wipes the jelly off his beard] What do you mean? This is the biggest turnout I've ever had!
[Suddenly, the ground starts to shake. Outside the farm, a UFO comes flying over and looms downward. The hatch opens and the tractor beam shines down. An object comes out from the UFO, which turns out to be some kind of strange outhouse. The door opens and green smoke fumes. Then, a strange alien appears within the smoke.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I think the party's over.
[The alien looked like is was going to attack SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins. But as the smoke clears, the alien looks almost like a hill-billy farmer.]
Farmer alien: Over? Why, it's just getting started. [pulls out a fiddle and plays music]
[Then some more hill-billy farmer aliens come out and play their instruments. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins join in the fun and dance around with the farmer aliens. The tractor continues driving around the kelp patch as everyone dances.]
SpongeBob: How did you guys know about the barn dance?
Farmer alien: Well, we seen your invitation.
SpongeBob: Invitation? What invitation?
[The farmer alien activates his fiddle and a green glow surrounds it. SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins and the farmer alien are also surrounded in a green glow.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? Wow.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float upward where they can see the view of the farm.]
Farmer alien: "Barn dance and hoedown tonight. Aliens welcome." [points down to the strange pattern in the kelp patch created by the tractor]
SpongeBob: Patrick, your crazy tractor driving invited them!
Patrick: [shows off his crop circle license] I have a crop circle license too.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float back down to the ground.]
Farmer alien: Thank you kindly for inviting us, old timer. Well, we're off to destroy the universe. [pulls out a ray gun]
Other farmer aliens: Yee-haw! [shoot their ray guns before heading back into their outhouse]
Old Man Jenkins: [chuckles] Y'all come back and invade any time.
SpongeBob: Annihilate safely.
[The farmer aliens close their outhouse door and the UFO's tractor beam floats them back into their ship before flying away.]
Farmer aliens: [as their UFO flies away] Yee-haw!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins wave good-bye to the farmer aliens just as Mr. Krabs pulls up in his boat.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey-ho, Jenkins! Has SpongeBob worked off me bill yet?
Old Man Jenkins: [rips the bill in pieces] You're all paid off, Krabs. [rubs SpongeBob's head] Now come back and visit anytime, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bye, Old Man Jenkins!
[SpongeBob and Patrick hop into Mr. Krabs' boat and they drive away from Old Man Jenkins' farm. SpongeBob is telling Mr. Krabs what they did while Patrick sleeps.]
SpongeBob: Then we gathered pearly eggs, fed the worm hogs, milked Bessie, and then we met some nice space aliens.
Mr. Krabs: Aliens? That's ridiculous. I think you've been working too hard, boy-o. Looks like you got farm stroke. You must have been hallucinating. There ain't no such thing as UFOs.
SpongeBob: Gee, you think we just imagined it?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, probably—[screams as a tractor beam suddenly shines over them, shocked he was wrong] A UFO!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, there is no such thing as aliens.
[The tractor beam lifts the boat and abducts SpongeBob, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs. Then the UFO turns and flies away into the sky as the tractor drives by the Krusty Krab.]


[The episode begins at the Barg'N Mart. Customers are minding their business doing their shopping.]
Barg'N Mart P.A.: Attention, shoppers: We've got a SpongeBob on Aisle 6.
[SpongeBob comes out of Aisle 6 with Patrick on his head while riding his unicycle and scaring the customers. But SpongeBob couldn't see where he was going due to having a blindfold on his face.]
Patrick: Make a sharp left!
[SpongeBob and Patrick ride down the hallway where it leads to the locking dock. They bash through the door and crash land in a junkyard of boxes outside.]
Patrick: We're here!
SpongeBob: [takes off his blindfold and pulls himself together] I still don't understand why you had me wear a blindfold.
Patrick: Oh, um, I didn't want you to get anything in your eyes. [widens his eyes] See? [his eyeballs are covered in dead flies, hair and a string tangled on his left; he pulls the string out, which grosses SpongeBob out a little; Patrick and SpongeBob then walk over to a box with a picture of a door drawn on it] Okay, thanks, buddy. I'm going to my club meeting now.
SpongeBob: What's your club, hmm? [giggles]
Patrick: Uh, it's the Empty Head Society. Eh, it's a place where guys like me can give their [reads card] "powerful intellects" a much-needed rest.
SpongeBob: Whoa! I'd love to rest my intellect. Can I join?
Patrick: Sure! Anyone can join. It's exclusive. [SpongeBob giggles and attempts to go into the box by pushing it, but nothing happens] Oh, that's not how you open it. [pulls out a stick and draws a square in the sand] You have to step on the automatic doormat. [SpongeBob steps in the dirt square] Ding! [Patrick lifts the box up and they both climb inside]
[Inside the box, there is a bunch of people, who appear as club members, acting in a goofy and idiotic manner similar to Patrick. One is eating a hot dog while being hung on a pole. The other is dancing on a blobfish member's fez. Two fish are playing with a lighting upside-down on the box's ceiling. One is dancing to the music with a chicken on the record player.]
SpongeBob: Wow. They do seem blissfully brainless. [prepares to walk over and join]
Patrick: Oh, oh, hold it! [grabs SpongeBob] You have to check your smart thingy at the door.
[Howard Blandy is in line at the check-in station, texting on his phone. He checks in by opening his head and give his brain to a lobster club member, who then gives him a fez. SpongeBob gets his turn. He reaches into his head and pulls out his brain, leaving his brain stems sparking. He gives his brain to the lobster club member, who also gives him a fez. Patrick gets his turn as well. He pulls out his eye and pushes out his brain, which is quite tiny compared to the others. The lobster club member gives Patrick a fez. One club member approaches SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sheldon: Hello, numbskull.
Patrick: Hiya, dodo!
Sheldon: Shall we do the Empty Head handshake?
Patrick: Okay!
[Patrick and club member dig into each other's mouths and give their handshakes with their tongues. One club member looks at the clock drawing next to him. He lifts a cinderblock and crushes his feet with it, screaming his head off in pain.]
SpongeBob: [gets startled by the screaming and hops in Patrick's arms] What was that?
Patrick: The signal for the meeting to start. Come on.
[All of the club members rush over to the stage, nearly knocking over SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick trips on a pail and begins rolling around. The pail bumps into a fallen member and sends them flying over to pile of pails in front of the stage. The club members then pounce on both SpongeBob and Patrick. One member removes the chicken from the record player and replaces it with a ham. The club president, the Ice Cream King, walks up to the stage, but trips over his own feet. He taps on a roll of toilet paper as if he's tapping a microphone.]
Ice Cream King: Good, I see everyone's in their assigned places. The secretary will now read the minutes. [lifts his belly and pulls out his secretary]
Ice Cream King's secretary: [reads off the back of the Kelpo cereal box] These are the minutes. One minute, twelve minutes, wait a minute, give me a minute.
Ice Cream King: Hike! [kicks his secretary off the stage] Are there any new initiates here tonight?
Patrick: [whispers] SpongeBob, go up. You always wanted to join the club. [launches SpongeBob up to the stage by bashing his fist on one club member's buttocks]
Ice Cream King: [looks suspiciously at SpongeBob as he giggled nervously] Hmm, are you sure you're, uh, brainless enough? [SpongeBob looks around and kicks the plank below him, which hits him in the face] Perfect! You've earned your first badge. [gives him a bacon strip as a badge; SpongeBob giggles weakly and gives Patrick a thumb's up] It's time to pass the jar.
SpongeBob: Hmm?
[One club member opens an empty jar and drools saliva into it. She passes it to a blobfish club member and he wrings saliva from his tongue into the jar. He passes the jar to an eel club member and he turns his fez like a faucet and pours saliva into the jar. He passes the jar over to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? Uh... [spits a drop of his saliva into the jar]
Empty Head Society club members: Drink! Drink! Drink!
[SpongeBob groans in disgust and tries to hesitate in drinking the jar full of saliva.]
Empty Head Society club members: Drink! Drink! Drink!
[SpongeBob gives in and drinks all of the saliva from the jar. He gags himself as he tries not to throw up and burps out a saliva bubble from his mouth.]
Empty Head Society club members: [shocked and grossed out] Ugh!
SpongeBob: What? You said drink!
Ice Cream King: [taps SpongeBob's shoulder] Ahem. [points to the lemonade stand next to him] Lemonade?
SpongeBob: Huh?
Ice Cream King: [takes the empty jar and puts it on the shelf where he keeps the other jars of saliva] We just save and date the drool. But that was so dopey you earned another badge! [pulls out used chewing gum from his mouth and puts it with SpongeBob's bacon badge] There! It's now time to go out in the community and help the citizens...[flings his toilet paper microphone at an unseen character, screaming "ow!"] of Bikini Bottom by doing our civic duty. Whatever that means.
SpongeBob: Uh, we're gonna do some civic duty?
Patrick: We call it the "Nitwitting." [jumps on the stage and joins in the Ice Cream King and the entire club to sing their oath]
Patrick, Ice Cream King, and the Empty Head Society club members: ♪We're all unfit. We must admit we're dumb as a box of rocks. [two club members bash each other's heads] But time permitting, we'll be nitwitting. Has anyone seen my socks?♪
Ice Cream King: To the mini boats!
Two Empty Head Society club members: To the mini boats!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, the Ice Cream King, and the Empty Head Society club members exit their clubhouse box and begin riding in mini boats.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, why are we doing this, again?
Patrick: I have no idea. [honks the horn]
[SpongeBob, Patrick, the Ice Cream King, and the Empty Head Society club members ride down the road in their mini boats. The townspeople scream and run away in fear. Lou hops onto his hot dog stand and rides away in it like a horse. An old lady hides into her house and zips her door shut just as the Empty Head Society ride pass. The scene changes to the bowling alley. A bowler goes to make a strike with his bowling ball.]
Trenchbilly Empty Head Society club member: Hey, mister. You dropped your ball. [swings his hockey stick and hits the ball like a puck, crashing it into the bowler's face]
[The two Empty Head Society club members create havoc in the bowling ally by flinging bowling balls at the bowlers. The scene cuts to Larry doing his workout on the treadmill at his gym.]
Blobfish Empty Head Society club member: Keep running. I'll pace you.
[Larry tries to run away, but the treadmill was moving too fast. He then gets crushed by the blobfish club member's mini boat. The scene changes to one of the club members painting happy faces on the traffic light.]
Shark Empty Head Society club member: These lights could use a smile.
[This action causes a major pile-up in the middle of the intersection and all the drivers complain. One Empty Head Society club member plows through the sidewalk with a lawnmower. The scene changes to Patrick breaking parking meters with a baseball bat. SpongeBob follows by putting bowls on the broken parking maters and pour soup in them.]
SpongeBob: I have a feeling you guys are a little confused about what civic duty is.
Patrick: [babbles while breaking off the parking meters] Uh, I don't think so! "Civic duty is using your patootie." [laughs and breaks the parking meter with his buttocks] No confusion there!
[A passing driver parks his boat and throws a quarter into the bowl of soup. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick looking at a garbage can.]
Patrick: Why would people throw their stinky garbage in these beautiful cans? [puts the garbage can on his head]
SpongeBob: Maybe their pockets were already full.
Ice Cream King: [rolls over to SpongeBob and Patrick in his own garbage can] "Pockets full?" I can clearly see you're not as brainless as us.
SpongeBob: [sadly] Aww…
Patrick: I can't see anything!
SpongeBob: [sighs] Oh well. [takes off his fez] I guess I'm just not Empty Head material. Well, bye, buddy. [places the fez on Patrick's garbage can and leaves]
Patrick: [lifts his garbage can up] My name's "Buddy" now?
[Patrick and the Ice Cream King then bash and hit each other with their garbage cans.]
Both: Buddy! Buddy! Buddy!
SpongeBob: [his head short-circuits while walking] Well, that's funny. I seem to be lost. Oh, I'll figure it out. I still got so life in the ol' brain stem.
[SpongeBob attempts to keep his brain stem alive by sprinkling water with his watering can. But since his brain's been out of his head for too long, they short-circuit and shrivel. All of a sudden, SpongeBob's head and face begin to deform and makes himself appear to be just as brainless as Patrick, the Ice Cream King, and the club members of the Empty Head Society.]
SpongeBob: [starts to sound goofy] What's a brain stem? I know! I'll just walk backwards and that should get me back to the beginning of the day. [walks backwards while talking backwards; he bumps into a "No Parking" sign] I'm even more lost-er than I was before-er. [gasps as he sees a lady at the bus stop] Oh, I will direct asking—[grunts in frustration] Ask directions. [barks like a seal, hops over to the lady in a goofy fashion and spins his body in front of her] Excuse me, large lady. I'm a widdle girl who's misplace herself. Can you help find me? [lisping] I'm pretty. [gets hit in the face by the lady's purse] Ow!
Abigail Marge: Weirdo! [screams as she runs away]
SpongeBob: Well, that didn't come out right. [whines]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking alone in a dark alley. He finds an old chair and goes to sit on it. But each time he tries to do so, he ends up doing it wrong. He gives up and sulks in a puddle on the ground.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I've forgotten how to sit!
Charlie: [chuckles] Obviously not the sharpest tool in the—the tool thing. [chuckles]
[SpongeBob mopes on the ground, helplessly. Just then, he sees something step out from the darkness. It was Patrick, holding a jar of brains.]
Patrick: Oh, there you are! You forgot your thinking thingy. I wasn't sure which one was yours, buddy.
SpongeBob: Uh, now my name's "Buddy?"
Patrick: No, duh. That's my name! I think.
SpongeBob: [takes Patrick's small brain and goes to stuff it in his head, but it falls out] No, not mine. [takes another one, but it slides out too] Wrong brain. [takes another one, but it slides out too] Oh, bad brain. Oh, I guess I'll take this stupid one. [takes a square-shaped brain and stuffs it in his head]
Patrick: [looks carefully at SpongeBob] Hmm...Hmm...[shakes SpongeBob's body for a bit] Try saying, "I'm ready."
SpongeBob: Slime ready! Uh, dime Betty! [Patrick wrings up SpongeBob like a wheel] Spaghetti! I'm sweaty! I'm all wetty! [Patrick grabs SpongeBob, stretches him and straightens him out as best as he could] I'm ready. [gasps as he is back to his normal self] I'm ready! I'm ready! High-five!
Patrick: Yeah! [gives SpongeBob a high-five, but makes his spiral around and around]
SpongeBob: [babbles in dizziness and laughs] Patrick, I know you and the Empty Head Society mean well, but man, we sure messed up a lot of things in town today. So, I'm gonna reverse all the damage that we did during the Nitwitting! [leaves]
Patrick: Hey, you'd better hurry because you're getting smaller! What a guy. Hmm? [knocks over the old chair and climbs into it with his head peaking out from the hole] Nothing like a good sit in a chair. [sighs]
[SpongeBob walks out into the street and goes to clean up the mess the Empty Head Society club members made. But much to his surprise, everything appears to be cleaned up and things are back to normal.]
SpongeBob: Oh, that's weird. Everything's already back to normal. What? [looks down and sees the sidewalk repaved; he walks around and sees the parking meters repaired; he then notices one part of the city that hasn't been cleaned] Hmm. Well, it's still a mess over here. [he backs up and bumps into a full trash can; he then meets up with his friend, Sandy, who has been cleaning up the mess all along] Sandy? You cleaned everything up?
Sandy: Of course, SpongeBob. I belong to a club called F.E.M.A. [holds up her membership card] That stands for "Fix the Emptyhead's Mess Again." Our civic duty is repairing the mayhem that the Empty Heads cause every month. You got some gunk on your tie.
SpongeBob: Yeah, they're badges. [eats the badge the Ice Cream King gave him]
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob. How would you like to join F.E.M.A.?
SpongeBob: No thanks. After giving my brain a vacation, I need a rest.
[Suddenly, SpongeBob and Sandy hear something.]
Both: Huh?
Sandy: Uh-oh! Speaking of "brain vacation." [grabs SpongeBob and hops into the trash can to hide from the Empty Head Society club members as they ride by]
[Patrick is among the group and honks his horn. The Empty Head Society club members cause a pile-up in the middle of the intersection and they all sing their oath.]
Ice Cream King and the Empty Head Society club members: ♪We're all unfit. We must admit we're dumb as a box of rocks. But time permitting, we'll be nitwitting…♪
Patrick: [drives through the club members] ♪Has anyone seen my socks?♪ [crashes into the screen, ending the episode]


[The episode begins with Plankton vandalizing the Krusty Krab with red paint.]
Plankton: [cackling] Yes! My plan is working! [throws away paint brush and throws a bucket full of paint at the restaurant's windows] Now everyone in town will know what a jerk Krabs is. Yeah! [the scene pans out to reveal that he drew pictures of Mr. Krabs and wrote threatening messages all over the restaurant and all of Bikini Bottom; as he laughs evilly, a police woman comes in and handcuffs him] Huh?
Lady officer: Hey, you! [pokes him with her batting stick] You're under arrest.
Plankton: Arrest? For what? I didn't even steal anything this time.
Mr. Krabs: Vandalism's a crime too. You've been caught red-handed, Plankton.
Plankton: Eh, should've used the green paint.
Mr. Krabs: I usually laugh all the way to the bank. [rubs Plankton's cheeks] But for you, Plankton, I'll laugh all the way to the clink! [laughs as he escorts the cop to the Bikini Bottom Jail where she will lock up Plankton]
Lady officer: Oh no, the prison is full! [the scene shows Bikini Bottom Jail completely overcrowded with criminals] Looks like we'll just have to set you free.
Mr. Krabs: [his jaw dropped in shock] What, free?! But he's a criminal!
Lady officer: Well, you know what they say. Don't stop the crime if you can't enforce the time.
Plankton: [laughs as he escapes the handcuff's clutches] Eat it, Krabs! I'm off to re-offend. [leaves with a paint brush]
Lady officer: It's a shame that there's no other place in Bikini Bottom to hold our extra criminals. 'Cause we'd give that place a lot of money. [holds out a pile of money]
Mr. Krabs: [giggles as his head changes into a gold coin; he shakes the officer's hand] You got yourself a deal! [stomps on Plankton so he wouldn't escape] We can lock him up at my place, [pulls Plankton back] the Krusty Krab.
Lady officer: Well then, [holds up a shackle with an iron ball] this is for the prisoner. [crushes Plankton with the iron ball] And here's your cash. [hands Mr. Krabs the pile of money]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Whoa. [giggles as he takes the money pile and makes a coat out of them; he puts on his money coat] Thank you, Madame Officer.
[Mr. Krabs takes the iron ball and rolls Plankton over to the Krusty Krab. Meanwhile, Squidward is busy scraping gum off under one of the tables.]
Squidward: Oh, stupid barnacles, tartar sauce, fish paste—
[The iron ball rolls through the front doors and flies into Squidward's face. Squidward, in form of bowling pins, is sent flying over to the register boat.]
Mr. Krabs: [cackles] Enjoy your ride, Plankton? [steps on Squidward's hand]
Squidward: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, sorry, Mr. Squidward. Didn't see you there.
[The iron ball falls on Squidward and crushes his head.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what's Plankton doing here, Mr. Krabs? I thought he was going to prison. [lifts the iron ball off of Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: He is. The Krusty Krab is a prison now. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [in a prisoner outfit while holding Plankton and a pennant that reads "Prison"] Oh, hooray! Prison!
Squidward: [blows air back into his head] Oh, big deal. I've been a prisoner here for years.
Mr. Krabs: [plugs a plunger in Squidward's face] Hardy-har, Mr. Squidward. [gives SpongeBob a bucket of cleaning supplies] You boys get back to work! [grabs Plankton] I'll be guarding Plankton in me office. [cuts to Mr. Krabs putting Plankton in a birdcage in his office] Into your cell, you miscreant! [places Plankton in the cage and crushes him with his iron ball]
Plankton: [shakes his head to pull himself together] All right, I'm out of here. [hops on the iron ball] Uh, pardon me, warden, sir, but is that a pretty penny on the floor?
Mr. Krabs: [rips his magazine and hops off his desk] Where? It's mine! It's mine! I saw it first! [searches the floor for the "penny"]
Plankton: [laughs as escapes the birdcage and heads for the door] The perfect escape. [all of a sudden, he gets clamped by a foothold trap set up by Mr. Krabs] YEEOOWW!!! [struggles to break free, but is lifted up by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no you don't. [blows air into Plankton to straighten him out] Trying to escape is bad enough, but lying about a penny? You're going in... [through his eyelids] ...the hole. [goes over to SpongeBob, who is washing the register boat with part of his spongy body] Need one of your holes, boy-o.
SpongeBob: [puts his spongy body part back in place and takes off his hat] You got it, Warden Krabs.
Plankton: Hey, let's not do anything we can't— [gets dropped into SpongeBob's body by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: And don't let him go nowhere!
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir! [plugs his head with a cork]
Plankton: [inside SpongeBob's body] All right, who turned off the lights? [pounds inside SpongeBob's body]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Sorry, sir. Plankton tickles inside of me. [giggles]
Mr. Krabs: That oughta learn him.
Lady officer: Morning, Warden.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, me favorite paying police lady. Here to give me more money?
Lady officer: Yup, more money for more prisoners.
Mr. Krabs: More prisoners?
[A prison truck pulls over and drops off a group of prisoners.]
Prisoner #1: Aye, the Krusty Krab. I used to eat here.
Prisoner #2: What a coincidence. I used to rob here.
[As prisoners line up, a pile of money is given to Mr. Krabs by the police woman.]
Lady officer: So, what do you say, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs wildly and takes the money] I say... lock 'em up! [picks up some money he dropped as the police woman leaves] SpongeBob! Try to prison-up the place for our new guests. I gotta go incarcerate all this cash. [giggles as he enters his office]
SpongeBob: I'll do my best, Warden Krabs, sir!
[SpongeBob goes to redecorate the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs picks up some money he dropped outside his office. The scene changes SpongeBob wearing a police hat and a badge while holding the keys. He is walking around and singing to himself. Moments later, Mr. Krabs comes out and takes a look at the Krusty Krab. The restaurant is now redesigned with prison cells for prisoners to sleep in. The Krusty Krab is now dubbed the Krusty Slammer. As prisoners are in their cells, they watch the regular customers eat their meals.]
Mr. Krabs: [whistles] Nice work, boy-o. Very prison-y.
Fred: Hey, uh, what's with all the caged men in here? [a prisoner grabs him by the neck and chokes him] They're making me a little nervous...!
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, um, well we're a prison-themed restaurant now. [secretly makes something with a pencil] Do your time with our new Prison Patty. [holds up a Krabby Patty in a poorly drawn prison-themed box] It's served in a solitary confinement box, has its own prisoner number, and even comes with toy shackles! [holds up a plastic toy shackle]
Fred: Wow!
Prisoner #3: [chokes Fred really hard] Looks delicious.
Mr. Krabs: At the Krusty Krab, you can lock up your hunger and throw away your keys! [the customers chatter in delight] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Ooh, crisis averted. Okay, time to let Plankton out of the hole. Open her up, boy-o. [SpongeBob removes his hat and unplugs his head] Hmm. [peaks in and sees Plankton becoming hysterical and is mentally going insane; Mr. Krabs reaches in SpongeBob's body and pulls Plankton out] Pull yourself together, prisoner! [slaps Plankton] I got a new cell for you.
[Mr. Krabs takes Plankton back into his office, removes the secret formula from the bottle, and places him inside the bottle.]
Plankton: [sees the formula outside the bottle] The formula?! It's so close... I can almost touch it! No, no, no, no!
Mr. Krabs: [cackles] Good times. Good times.
[The scene changes to nighttime at the Krusty Krab aka Krusty Slammer. The whole place is barricaded with barbwires and steel walls. A search light is shining all over to place to make sure that none of the prisoners escape. SpongeBob comes in with a cart full of mail for the prisoners.]
SpongeBob: Okay, mail call, boys. Let's see, who do we have? [pulls out some letters] Toothy. [gives a letter to Reggie] Four Eyes. [gives a letter to a prisoner with four eyes] Lefty. [gives a letter to prisoner who is facing left] Fats. [gives a letter to a skinny prisoner] Fingers. [gives a letter to a prisoner with loads of fingers all over its body] Einstein. [gives a letter to a floating brain with a mustache; quickly reads off names while throwing letters at a fast pace] Stretch, Chuckles, Bingo, Blammy, Wheels, Boogie, Red, Trip, Winks, Skeeter, Stinky.
Prisoners: Thanks, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No problem, guys.
[SpongeBob rolls the mail cart away. Mr. Krabs is busy continuing his non-stop torture on Plankton. He spins Plankton up and down like a yo-yo. Then he paddles him back and forth like a paddle ball. Then he stretches him and uses him as a jump rope. Just then, the police woman comes in.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, morning, officer.
Lady officer: I'm here to oversee Plankton's release. [holds up Plankton's release form] His sentence is up.
Mr. Krabs: What?! But I have so many more punishments for him!
Plankton: [laughs as the police woman leaves; he breaks free from Mr. Krabs' fist] Enjoy your Plankton-free prison, Eugene. [runs to the door] I hope it's worth what you're paying for it. [laughs as he exits the restaurant/prison]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? Paying for it? Wonder what he means by that. Huh?
[Mr. Krabs sees Fred in a high-class cell. Fred is fluffing up his pillow and goes to sleep in a warm, comfy bed. Mr. Krabs wails in a shocking surprise. The Tattletale Strangler is seen with facial cream and cucumbers on his eye lids. He drinks some lemonade and goes back to relaxing. One prisoner is putting suntan lotion on another prisoner's back and gives him a massage. Squidward, in fancy clothing, serves a prisoner a plate full of Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: More marshmallows for your hot cocoa, Wobbles? [places marshmallows in a prisoner's mug of hot chocolate; in doing so, the drink forms into dollar signs and splashes back in the mug]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?! [slaps SpongeBob's face with his tongue] Do you have any idea how much it costs to make a prison humane?! These down comforters, they're two-y. [rips a comforter off of Fred's bed, making him shiver] This ain't no luxury hotel! [rips the tube out of a prisoner's hot tub] These televisions ain't free! [rips a television off the wall] And neither are these massage chairs! [takes away the massage chair and replaces it with a barrel, making the prisoner cry like a baby] And this, your most expensive mistake of all! [takes Krabby Patties out of Stickyfins' and Dorsal Dan's mouths and stuffs them into the con man's mouth while reaching in his pocket and steals his money] From now on, no more patties for prisoners!
[The prisoners are outraged at Mr. Krabs' cruel treatment and throw tomatoes at him in retaliation.]
Dorsal Dan: Cruel and unusual punishment!
Mr. Krabs: And no more tomatoes either!
[During the riot, the customers get hit by the tomatoes.]
Female customer: Come on, let's find another prison to eat at.
Customers: [as they exit the restaurant/prison in disgust] What a rip-off! / Come on.
Mr. Krabs: No, no! Come back! Come back! I can't afford to lose me paying customers. Oh, I'm ruined! [sobs] All right, that's it! [pushes a button on a remote and sets the prisoners free] No more prison! Everyone out! [pushes the prisoners out] Don't care where you go, but you can't stay here! [closes the door] Oh, finally. The Krusty Krab is back to being a regular old money-making restaurant. [giggles] Problem solved. [SpongeBob is about to say something against against Krabs' decision, but he cuts him off] I said problem solved! [throws SpongeBob out and heads back into his office in a confident smile]
French Narrator: Later at night...
[The scene changes to SpongeBob's house. A group of strange creatures arrive and sneak inside. SpongeBob is sleeping in his bed and a shadow looms over him. SpongeBob wakes up and screams in fear as if he's seeing a monster. Eyes glow in the dark and surround SpongeBob. He turns on the light and sees that the creatures that came into his house are the prisoners Mr. Krabs kicked out earlier.]
SpongeBob: Oh, it's just my prison pals. What are you guys doing here?
Prisoner #4: We want to go back to the Krusty Krab. We were having fun in there with you. See? [shows a tattoo of himself hugging SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [out of sympathy] Aww. Okay, I'm in. Time for a jail-break-in.
French Narrator: The next day...
[The scene changes the morning at the Krusty Slammer. Mr. Krabs enters the restaurant and prepares to open it for the day, when suddenly...]
Prisoners: Morning, Warden Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Morning, prisoners! [gasps in horror as he sees the prisoners back in their cells] SpongeBob! What is going on here? I set all these criminals free last night! What are they doing back in their cells?!
SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs, now's probably not the best time to—
[Too late. The police woman had overheard everything Mr. Krabs said about releasing the prisoners the previous night, as he shrinks back in fear. She is seen sitting at a table eating her Krabby Patty.]
Lady officer: You know it's a crime to release prisoners early, don't ya? [eats her patty and approaches Mr. Krabs who realizes his error] You're going to prison, [handcuffs Mr. Krabs] criminal.
Mr. Krabs: What? Oh, well, that's not so bad. Pencil me in for a 3:30 massage, SpongeBob.
Lady officer: [takes Mr. Krabs away] Oh, you're not staying here. The Krusty Krab is full. We got a new prison just for you.
Mr. Krabs: [sadly] Oh, no... Let me guess...
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket where Mr. Krabs is wearing his prison outfit and is placed in the same birdcage he used for Plankton. Mr. Krabs groans sadly.]
Plankton: Mealtime, prisoner! [laughs while throwing spoonfuls of raw chum in Mr. Krabs' face in an act of revenge for the all the painful torture he endured; Mr. Krabs cries in an agonizing defeat right before Plankton throws some chum into his mouth] Right in the mouth.


[The episode begins with a morning at Conch Street. Squidward is coming out of his house with a bunch of stuff.]
Squidward: [sighs] One glorious week [pulls out his keys] without those two...
[Suddenly, SpongeBob and Patrick appear under the RV.]
SpongeBob: Hey!
[Squidward steps on SpongeBob and Patrick and twirls until he, SpongeBob, and Patrick fly into the air.] [Seaweed music starts playing.]
Squidward: ...Idiots!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Patrick land safely on the ground, but Squidward injures himself and his stuff falls on him. SpongeBob walks towards Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Squidward! [SpongeBob pulls Squidward out by grabbing his head. Eventually, SpongeBob manages to get Squidward, then SpongeBob gets tangled on Squidward's tentacles. Patrick walks to SpongeBob and Squidward as he pulls one of Squidward's tentacles to get SpongeBob out.] You should be more careful.
Patrick: Tisk, tisk... tisk!
Squidward: Would you two go away and stop ruining my vacation?!
SpongeBob: Vacation? Gee, I didn't think Mr. Krabs gave us any vacations.
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick away from him.]
Squidward: I found someone to cover for me.
[We cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Old Man Walker is at register boat for taking Squidward's side.]
Old Man Walker: One Krabby Patty coming up, sir.
[Old Man Walker tries to work the cash register. He presses the button that opens and sends himself straight through the window to the kitchen. Cut back at Conch Street where Squidward is putting his case and sack on the top of his RV.]
SpongeBob: Where are you going on your vacation, Squidward?
Squidward: If you must know, I'm going to Porpoise Peak to bask in the melodious sounds of the Warbling Water Lily. [A cloud appears and shows the Warbling Water Lily. Imagination SpongeBob and Patrick appear and whiteness the Warbling Water Lily. A clock appears in the sky and the big hand points at the 500.] Which only blooms once every five hundred years. [The cloud pops and Imagination SpongeBob and Patrick come out small. Squidward grabs them.] And I'm going alone. [smacks the mini SpongeBob and Patrick together and the mini Patrick runs up to SpongeBob and Patrick as Patrick puts the mini Patrick in his pocket]}}
SpongeBob: I know! [quickly runs back with a different outfit and a case] Patrick and I will come along, and we can all be alone together.
Squidward: Oh no, you're not messing up my vacation. [picks up SpongeBob's case and slams it on him] Now beat it! If I don't get moving, I'm gonna miss it. [walks to get himself packed and ready]
SpongeBob: [pops out of the case with Squidward's shirt on] Oh, we'll help you pack.
Squidward: No way, you idiots will just break... [But SpongeBob and Patrick didn't break anything. They got Squidward's stuff packed.] ...everything? [impressed] Oh.
Patrick: Hold it! [steps of the RV and falls] We forgot to pack this. [points at the ramp]
[Patrick uses his mouth to pull the ramp off of the RV. SpongeBob hops off the RV and helps Patrick to pull the ramp off. They both pull it off until it hits Patrick's face. Patrick then laughs.]
Squidward: What? No, don't! Stop!
[Suddenly, the RV drives off. Squidward screams in terror as he watches his RV drive off in the distance. He runs off after it and pushes SpongeBob and Patrick over. Squidward then stops and watches the RV drive off. SpongeBob and Patrick shows up and watch it too. The RV drives off though traffic, then it hits a sign that says "Bridge Out". The RV then drives through two rings of fire and passes by an octopus' arm. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward worry that the RV would crash until it finally stops.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Phew.
[But as soon as they are relieved that the RV stopped, an anchor smashes the RV, causing it to explode. Squidward becomes utter shocked that his RV is destroyed thanks to SpongeBob and Patrick. Now he can't see the warbling water lily.]
Patrick: You could buff that out.
[Squidward gets angry and ink splatters out of his head.]
Squidward: [to Patrick] How could?!... [to SpongeBob] Why would?!... [stutters] I can't believe it! [Squidward has angered out words until he turns sad. A tire is on fire and starts wheeling towards SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward.] I'll never see the warbling water-lily bloom now.
[Squidward then walks to his house and bangs his head on the door to open it. Squidward then enters his house all sad and closes his door, now that his chances of seeing the warbling water lily are shattered. SpongeBob and Patrick feel ashamed of themselves of what they have done: They ruined Squidward's hopes of seeing the warbling water lily. SpongeBob and Patrick begin to feel bad for Squidward as he walks to his house.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh. Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh! I have an idea.
Patrick: Really? What's that like?
[Inside Squidward's bedroom, Squidward is getting ready for bed. He is still angry at SpongeBob and Patrick for ruining his hopes on seeing the warbling water lily.]
Squidward: Little monsters. They oughta be locked up. Throw away the key and then... [snores] Locked up and throw them away. [Squidward dreams that he is at Porpoise Peak seeing the warbling water lily. Squidward drives his RV, then sings and dances to two warbling water lilies. He smells them until the warbling water lilies open and reveals to be SpongeBob and Patrick. They start laughing, a purple shadow background shows. Squidward wakes up from his sleep and screams in horror. He is now in SpongeBob's house.] Oh, oh, phew. It was only a nightmare. [The camera zooms out revealing SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward looks at SpongeBob and screams, he then looks at Patrick then screams as well. SpongeBob and Patrick both scream as Squidward screams. Squidward grabs their mouths.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward.
Squidward: [pulls them over] Would you get out of my bedroom?!
SpongeBob: [laughs] We're not in your bedroom, silly.
[Squidward notices his bed is in SpongeBob's living room. He quickly jumps off of his bed.]
Squidward: What? How did I get here?
SpongeBob: Patrick and I mo-
Squidward: [covers SpongeBob's mouth] Actually, I don't care. [leaves to get out of SpongeBob's house] Goodbye, SpongeB- [Just as Squidward was about to leave, he falls out of SpongeBob's door, which his house is now an RV.] [Sponge Monger music starts playing.] [Squidward quickly gets back inside SpongeBob's house, he then notices two-passenger seats and a steering wheel. Squidward notices SpongeBob's house is an RV.] SpongeBob, why is your house... [screaming] driving on the road?!
Patrick: Because we turned it into an RV!
SpongeBob: We didn't want you to miss that flower blooming.
Squidward: Okay. Hold on. Who's driving?
Patrick: It's on Autosnail.
[Gary is shown driving and is being distracted by his toy.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Come on, let's get breakfast. [takes Squidward's hand]
[Bubble transition to the kitchen where Patrick and Squidward are sitting. Patrick is laughing while he has a knife and fork in his hand. SpongeBob tosses three coffee mugs, three plates, and coffee on the table. He then walks to the table with two stacks of pancakes. Squidward smells them.]
Squidward: Hey, this looks pretty good.
[All of a sudden, unknowing to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, the RV drives to a wobbly damaged bridge. Squidward is about to eat his pancakes, but the plates slide off due to the RV on the bridge. Squidward tries to eat his pancakes again but misses again. The RV wobbles onto the bridge. Finally, Squidward reaches his pancakes with his fork. Squidward is about to eat his pancakes, but the RV drives into a bump on the bridge. Squidward accidentally puts the pancakes in his mouth and chokes. He then spits the pancakes out in front of Patrick.]
Patrick: [points at the pancakes] Are you gonna eat that?
[The RV is off the bridge, which causes it to break. Gary is shown tired for driving so much.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, let's give Gary a break.
Patrick: Disengaging Autosnail! [presses a button to give the toy to Gary]
[Gary starts chewing on his toy while Patrick takes his place.]
Gary: [chewing on his toy] Meow, meow, meow, meow.
Patrick: Let's see what this pineapple can do! [Patrick presses on the breaks and drives faster, which it follows him running over a "Road Closed" sign and drives to the mountain. Squidward notices how high they are and sees a bunch of boats all damaged.] On the road!
Squidward: [gulps] We gotta get off this road!
Patrick: No problem.
[Patrick then press a button which activates rocket boosters from the back of the RV. He drives off very fast on five roads. Patrick is driving so fast it sends Squidward off his seat and slams on the wall. He then notices SpongeBob next to him.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: [screams] I'm not here! This isn't happening!
[Suddenly, the RV drives on the steepest hill and up a ramp. It then flies in mid-air. Inside the RV, Squidward floating in mid-air as the RV is flying. Squidward grabs onto a door and accidentally opens it. A bunch of SpongeBob's stuff comes out of his door. Squidward misses it, but gets hit by a safe. SpongeBob is watching TV, which is floating along with his couch and chair. Gary is still chewing on his toy while floating as well. Patrick begins to float too. The RV lands on the road which they arrive at Porpoise Peak. Squidward hits through the sign. SpongeBob exits out of his house.]
SpongeBob: [laughs cheerfully] We're here!
Squidward: [shakes his head] Huh? [Squidward gasps as he sees the warbling water lily.] The warbling water lily! [pulls out his camera and runs towards the flower] Oh, so beautiful! And I have it all to my... [Suddenly, a group of people show up to see the flower and start taking pictures.] Ow! My back! [Squidward moves a few people out of his way, so he can take a picture of the flower, but it suddenly disappears.] Huh? Where is it?
[Patrick comes up with the warbling water lily.]
Patrick: Is this that babbling buttercup you were looking for?
[Patrick gives Squidward the flower as everyone looks in surprise. The flower then sprouts out, a light glows right before Squidward's eyes and starts playing music. But all of a sudden, the flower starts to dry out. Everyone gasps in complete shocked. Squidward is shocked to see that the flower as dried out as well.] [House of Horror music starts playing.] [Everyone gets angry at Squidward and starts attacking him. SpongeBob walks towards the flower and notices how dry out it is. The fishes take Squidward and bury him into the ground and leave. Monroe comes up with a watering can and waters Squidward out of the ground like a flower. SpongeBob and Patrick come up to Squidward and SpongeBob smells his head. Squidward comes out and gets rid of the dirt.]
Squidward: Well, that's one more vacation down the drain. May as well go home.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Well, we got a long drive ahead of us. [pulls toilet paper out of his hole] We better go before go if you know what I mean-o.
Patrick: [laughs] Not really.
SpongeBob: Now, Squidward, don't leave without us. [laughs and leaves]
Squidward: [gets an idea] Huh? Of course not! Only a monster would leave you behind. [Squidward grins evilly and eventually, he leaves them behind, driving the RV.] So I'm a monster. [whistles] They'll be fine. Alone. [begins to sweat] On top of a mountain. In the middle of nowhere. [But Squidward stops the RV, realizing that he can't leave SpongeBob and Patrick behind.] D'oh, I can't do it!
[Squidward reverses back to get SpongeBob and Patrick. We cut back to the woods where SpongeBob and Patrick are finished using the bathroom. Patrick has toilet paper all over him.]
SpongeBob: Hey, you're really getting the hang of using toilet paper, Patrick.
Patrick: And next week, I'm starting on two-ply.
SpongeBob: I'll get another roll from the RV. [SpongeBob walks towards to the RV, but to find that it's gone, due to Squidward leaving them behind.] Hey, where is the RV?
Patrick: [points] Well, maybe those guys have seen it. Hey, hey! Have you seen our pineapple?
[A group of sea bears, like the ones from "The Camping Episode”, show up and growls at Patrick. We cut back to Squidward still driving the RV to get SpongeBob and Patrick. He then parks the RV and looks for SpongeBob and Patrick. All of a sudden, SpongeBob and Patrick’s screams are heard.]
Squidward: Oh no, I'm too late! [Squidward runs to a cave and karate chops one of the sea bears.] Don't you dare eat those morons!
[But instead of hearing screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick were laughing and tickling the sea bears.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, they weren't eating us.
Patrick: We were just having a tickle fight. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Sea bears love it when you tickle their bellies.
Patrick: [laughs] But they hate it when you karate chop their hineys.
Squidward: [realizing what he has done while the sea bears growl at him] Uh, tickle, tickle?
[The sea bears begin to attack and maul Squidward.] [Sponge Monger music plays again.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, they'll leave you alone if you play dead!
Patrick: [pulls out a tombstone that says "RIP Squidward" and throws it at Squidward] This will help! Catch!
[The tombstone hits Squidward's head while he is being mauled to death. The sea bears stop mauling Squidward and leaves.]
SpongeBob: Bye. Call me. You got my number. [Bubble transition to Conch Street where the RV bumps into Squidward's house and parks. SpongeBob kicks open the door.] Wow! Was that a fun road trip or was that a fun road trip? [Patrick comes out of the RV and spins in the air of excitement.]
Patrick: The funnerest!
[Squidward walks up out of the RV with bandages on him after being attacked by sea bears.]
Squidward: More like the worst road trip. My one chance to hear the warbling water lily and you ruined it! [falls out of the RV]
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Are you sure about that, Squidward? [pulls out the flower] Ohh, poor thing just needs some love. [pours water into the pot and kisses it]
Squidward: [gasps] The warbling water lily! [The warbling water lilt begins to play.] So beautiful. [pulls out his clarinet and plays]
SpongeBob: Oh, my ears! My ears! It hurts! It hurts! [SpongeBob breaks apart and Patrick's head explodes and screams.] We're so happy for you, Squidward!
[They run back into the RV to escape from the racket.]
Patrick: Engage Autosnail!
[The episode ends with SpongeBob and Patrick drive off as Squidward plays his clarinet with the warbling water lily.]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Gary doing their morning exercises. SpongeBob stretches his legs really long and Gary stretches his eyestalks. They lose their balance and fall over.]
SpongeBob: Okay, that's enough stretching.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Now we're ready for a morning jog.
Gary: Meow!
[SpongeBob puts the leash on Gary's snail and goes to walk him. But Gary pulls him back and crashes into SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Gary? Don't you like jogging?
Gary: Meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, right. You're a snail. Hm. We've got to find a way to get you moving.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob creating a tank for Gary to ride on.]
SpongeBob: [picks Gary up] This should do it. [places Gary on the tank] You'll "tank" me later. [laughs]
[SpongeBob jogs in place and the tank begins to move. Then they both proceed their morning jog.]
SpongeBob: Hey, now you're moving.
[Suddenly, the tank malfunctions and begins to drive out of control.]
Gary: Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: [gets run over by the tank] Whoa—ow! [appears flattened and injured] I'm okay. [gets run over again] Ow! [gets run over again] Ow! [gets run over again] Yow!
[The tank repeatedly runs over SpongeBob until he is completely flattened. The tank crashes into the lamppost, sending Gary flying.]
Gary: Meow! [lands upside-down on his shell]
[Gary tries to get himself up, but fails. SpongeBob pulls out a sponge-shaped cookie cutter and cuts himself free. He then rushes over to Gary.]
SpongeBob: Aww, poor Gary. [picks up Gary] Looks like you could use a leg up. [comes up with an idea] Or maybe two.
[Gary whimpers in worry. The scene changes to SpongeBob making something out of wood with some wood-carving tools.]
SpongeBob: [removes goggles] There! A perfect set of legs. [reveals to have made a wooden table as he blows the wood dust off] Now let's make some for you.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob wearing a doctor's mask and Gary is on the operating table.]
SpongeBob: This will only hurt for a second. [pulls his legs off] Yow! [reproduces new legs and pushes the button to activate the table]
Gary: [flies upward] Meow! [lands on his shell and SpongeBob places the legs underneath Gary] Meow.
SpongeBob: [kicks the table away and sets Gary down] Voilà! What do you think, Gary?
Gary: [looks at his new legs] Me—ow, meow—meow.
SpongeBob: Let's try 'em out. Come on. Come to SpongeBob.
Gary: Hm. [struggles to walk, but is having a hard time]
SpongeBob: Oh, your first steps.
Gary: Meow. [nearly falls over but continues to walk]
SpongeBob: My little guy's growing up. [catches Gary after successfully walking to him] Now let's try something a little harder.
[SpongeBob bends his legs up and down. Gary does the same. SpongeBob does some kicks with his legs.]
Gary: [does some kicks with his new legs] Meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Ooh, not bad. Try this. [performs an Irish jig]
Gary: [performs an Irish jig with his new legs] Meow, meow, meow, meooow!
SpongeBob: Nice moves. [does the Irish jig with Gary, but ends up getting his feet tangled] Ow! [falls over] Ah! [gasps] The student has surpassed the master.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob preparing another walk with Gary to show off his new legs.]
SpongeBob: Ready to stretch your stuff, Gare-bear?
Gary: Meow, meow. [begins running with his new legs] Meow!
SpongeBob: Hey, wait! [gets dragged by Gary] Whoa!
Gary: Meow, meow. [stops at the gate of the snail park]
SpongeBob: Oh! [flips over and backward] Oy. [gets himself up and removes Gary's leash] After you.
Gary: Meow, meow.
[SpongeBob and Gary enter the snail park. As they wonder around, the people and their pets look in awe at Gary's new limbs. They had never seen a snail with legs before.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, that's right. You're not dreaming. Check it out. Snail with legs, people.
[SpongeBob and Gary walk up to Ms. Mildred and her snail.]
Gary: Meow. [winks at Ms. Mildred's snail and growls flirtatiously]
[Ms. Mildred's snail purrs daintily.]
Bikini Bottomites: Would you look at that. Well, that's certainly different.
[A worm looks at Gary's new legs and sniffs at them. Gary hisses angrily and the worm barks back at the legged snail. Gary kicks the worm with his new legs and sends the worm flying over to its owner, who gets really angry.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Gary!
Worm owner: Hey, control your snail, fella!
SpongeBob: Sorry. Guess Gary's new legs got him a little excited.
[The worm blows a raspberry at Gary.]
Gary: [hisses angrily and kicks the worm and its owner with his new legs] Pow!
Worm owner: You'll be hearing from my lawyer! [pops in the sky]
[The other people and their pets see this and get really angry.]
Bikini Bottomites: What is your problem, man?
[Just when the people and their pets are about to attack them, Gary uses his new legs to kick them. Gary goes to attack the other people with his new legs.]
SpongeBob: Oh, wh—s—sorry!
[Everyone runs out of the snail park in fear.]
Fred: His legs!
SpongeBob: Gary the snail, that was very naughty!
Gary: [licks SpongeBob's hand] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh. [laughs] I can't stay mad at you. [pets Gary and puts the leash back on his shell]
Gary: [runs off with his new legs] Meow!
SpongeBob: [gets pulled forward] Whoa!
[Gary pulls SpongeBob really hard until he reaches to the pineapple house's front door. SpongeBob collapses from exhaustion.]
SpongeBob: [tries to open the door, but is too tired] I'm a little beat, Gary. Can you give me a hand with the door?
Gary: Meow—ow. [tries to open the door, but ends up getting his eyestalks tangled]
SpongeBob: Looks like I should give you a hand, huh?
[The scene changes to SpongeBob examining Gary with a measuring tape.]
SpongeBob: Hm? Hm. Hmm. [produces two extra arms for Gary] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [takes the arms] Yow! [breaks them apart and sticks them onto Gary] They look a little tight in the shoulder.
Gary: [looks at his new arms] Meow—meow, meow—meow. [points out that SpongeBob gave him two left-handed arms]
SpongeBob: Whoops! I accidentally gave you two left hands. [pulls the pinky and makes it into the perfect right hand] Boop! Perfect. Give 'em a test drive, Gary.
Gary: [struggles to move his new arms] Meow, meow, meow... [his arms fall downward; he tries to pull them up, but they're too heavy]
SpongeBob: Maybe you just need some motivation. [holds out a can of snail food]
Gary: Meow. [struggles to move his new arms to reach for the can of snail food, but squeezes SpongeBob's eyes by accident] Meow!
SpongeBob: [yelps in pain] You're doing it, Gary. Yes, yes! Keep it up, keep it up! [get slapped in the face by Gary's new arms] Ow! Yes, yes!
Gary: [slaps SpongeBob's face] Meow!
SpongeBob: That's it, Gary. [gets slapped again] Move the— [gets slapped again] Move the— [gets slapped again] Move those arms.
[The scene changes to Gary trying out various things with his new arms.]
Gary: Meow—ow—ow—ow—ow—ow. [flips the light switch on and off; then he goes to open the front door and sees Patrick] Meow? [slams the door before Patrick could say anything] Meow.
[Gary happily runs up and down the stairs while carrying SpongeBob and laughing. Gary then feeds SpongeBob some food in the kitchen. He imitates a train sound before stuffing SpongeBob's mouth with the food. SpongeBob talks to Gary with his mouth full. He points out the he can't chew his food on his own.]
Gary: [annoyed] Meow. [moves SpongeBob's mouth up and down to help him chew the food]
French Narrator: One Weekend of Pampering Later...
[SpongeBob is shown resting on the couch with a blanket. Gary gives SpongeBob a cup of hot chocolate and sits next to him to watch some television. Suddenly, SpongeBob's head starts to shake.]
SpongeBob: Ow! [sticks out his tongue and sees an alarm clock ringing] Yikes! Look at the time! I gotta get to the Krusty Krab. [throws the clock away] Thanks for spoiling me, Gary. I didn't have to lift a "finger." [pulls the blanket off and sees his own limbs old and worn out] My fingers... [goes to walk]  Wha—! [but falls over] A whole weekend of pampering has left my limbs in limbo. [drags across the floor with his tongue] Got. To go. To work. [crawls over to the front door and sees his hat] Hm? [tries to reach it, but falls over; his limbs wither and curl up, leaving SpongeBob completely motionless] Too weak to flip Krabby Patties. [whimpers]
[Gary walks over to SpongeBob. He takes pity on poor SpongeBob for having his limbs become worn out from all the pampering.]
Gary: [sympathetically] Ooh. Uh-oh.
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab. The customers are eating their patties, but they find snail slime on them, much to their disgust. One customer eats it, but becomes grossed out. He walks over to Mr. Krabs.]
Customer #1: Excuse me, but I would like to complain!
Mr. Krabs: I see. Well, the Krusty Krab takes customers feedback very seriously, sir. After they pay the $5.00 complaint fee.
Customer #1: All right, fine. [reluctantly gives Mr. Krabs $5.00]
Mr. Krabs: Yee—hee—hee—hee. [turns his head and places the dollar in it] Thank you, sir. Now what seems to be your problem?
Customer #1: There is slime on my patty!
Customer #2: And mine has—[eats his slime-covered patty] slime on it, too.
Sheldon: My patty doesn't have enough slime! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What? Give me that. [eats the slime-covered patty, but spits it out] Bleh! Ugh! Gah! SpongeBob! Just what do you think you're doing [enters the kitchen] changing me patty... [sees Gary at the grill] formula?
Gary: [tips his hat] Meow. Meow—mow. [flips patties but leaves a mess of slime]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Why is there a mollusk cooking me Krabby Patties?
Squidward: I thought it was strangely quiet and peaceful today.
Mr. Krabs: Where the halibut is SpongeBob?
Squidward: Maybe he quit? Or got hit by a bus?! Or caught a terminal disease!
Mr. Krabs: I don't care if he turned into a bucket of chum. I need me fry cook! [leaves to go check on SpongeBob] Mr. Squidward, you have the helm. [exits the restaurant]
Squidward: [speaks through megaphone] Attention Krusty Krab customers: Get out. It's time for my break.
[The customers leave the restaurant. Mr. Krabs knocks on the front door to SpongeBob's house.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Are you okay in there? You catch the flu or something? Ugh. Are you at death's door? Because you know darn well they ain't valid excuses to miss work! [peeks through the window and finds to his shocking surprise that SpongeBob is slithering on the floor with his tongue like a snail; SpongeBob eats some food from Gary's food bowl] Ah! SpongeBob has gone full raving loony. [hears something] Uh-oh! [hides underground as Gary appears]
Gary: ♪Meow—meow—meow—meow—meow—meow—meow. Meow—meow—meow—meow—meow—meow.♪ [enters the house]
[Mr. Krabs peeks through the window again. He sees SpongeBob rubbing his head against the chair while Gary's reading the paper. Gary pets SpongeBob and holds out a snail toy for him to play. SpongeBob plays the toy with his eye. Mr. Krabs gasps and drills himself inside through the floor.]
Gary: Meow?
Mr. Krabs: What in the name of Neptune's nostrils is going on in here?! SpongeBob, you're acting like you're the pet and that darn snail is the owner!
Gary: [hits Mr. Krabs with the toy] Meow! Meow—meow—meow.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the toy] Bad snail! Down boy! [gets attacked by SpongeBob] SpongeBob, what are you—[gets licked and pummeled by SpongeBob until he pushes him off and shakes him violently] Oh, snap out of it, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob doesn't respond. Mr. Krabs pulls out a Krabby Patty, breaks it in half and puts it under SpongeBob's nose. SpongeBob smells the patty's scent and shakes himself back to normal, snapping himself out of the strange trance.]
SpongeBob: [dazed] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Have you completely lost your mind, boy-o? Snails ain't supposed to have arms and legs.
SpongeBob: Aww, but Gary is so happy with his new limbs.
[Gary files his new arms.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, is he? Well, it's time to cut this nonsense! [growls and goes to fight Gary] Ay! [growls at Gary viciously] Huh-hah!
[Mr. Krabs leaps over to Gary and cuts the arms and legs, returning Gary back to his normal self.]
Gary: [sniffs the severed limbs] Meow. [slithers over to his food bowl, removes SpongeBob's name and goes to eat his food]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry I forgot who I was.
Mr. Krabs: That's okay, boy-o.
SpongeBob: And Gary, I am so sorry I tried to change you.
[Gary belches and proceeds to eat his food.]
SpongeBob: And Patrick, I'm sorry I haven't returned your hat yet. [shows an enormous hat with a train on it]
Patrick: [sobs quietly and hugs SpongeBob before getting his hat back] It's okay... [leaves]
SpongeBob: [sees the severed limbs walking away] Hm? [grabs a severed arm] Well, I guess I shouldn't let these go to waste. I can always use an extra hand [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] All right, all right. That's enough Sponge-bobbery for today, boy-o. [holds out the spatula] Time to get you flipping patties again. [leaves for the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob]
[The scene changes to nighttime and SpongeBob and Gary are getting ready for bed.]
SpongeBob: Ah, sure is nice having everything back to normal, isn't it Gare-bear? [climbs into bed] Yup. Same old, same old.
[After a brief silence, SpongeBob and Gary look at each other.]
Gary: Meow—ow. [slithers onto the bed while SpongeBob goes to sleep on the floor; they both sigh] Meow. Meow.
SpongeBob: Oops! Sorry. [his severed arms come out from under the bed and claps] Boop-boop.
[The lights turn off and the screen becomes black, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins with a group of strange creatures called sea chimps singing in harmony while doing their daily chores. Suddenly, everything starts shaking and the sea chimps screech in fear. It turns out that they reside in an aquarium owned by SpongeBob. SpongeBob is dragging the aquarium down the street singing the same tune as the sea chimps. Fred and his wife are having a date at café when SpongeBob passes by singing and hopping around while dragging his aquarium.]
Fred: You know that child we were planning on having?
Fred and his wife: Let's forget it.
[SpongeBob skids the aquarium to the front doors of the Chum Bucket where he meets up with Karen.]
Karen: SpongeBob, I could hear you caterwauling a mile away.
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, [hops off the aquarium] and thanks for watching my sea chimps while I'm at work. [inhales and blows out his work hat from his head]
Karen: They're already in an aquarium. Why don't you just leave 'em at home?
SpongeBob: [puts earphones over the aquarium and leans in closer so Karen could hear] I think Gary might be trying to eat them. I found saliva on the glass.
Karen: So what do I need to do for them?
SpongeBob: Nothing! They'll take care of themselves. Oh! [feels the wind] Hm! [takes out an umbrella] Well, I got to go. Here's my breeze. [opens his umbrella and flies away with the wind] Whoa-ow-ow-ow!}
[Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs has once again prevented Plankton from stealing the Krabby Patty formula and is carrying him out of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: When will you ever learn that a tiny pipsqueak like you will never, ever take over anything? [stretches and squishes Plankton like putty] What do you call this gizmo you made anyway? [points to a very odd-looking device that is completely unfinished]
[Plankton's device goes haywire and puffs smoke in Plankton's face.]
Plankton: [coughs] The Takeover-er-er.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] That's just stupid. [stretches and flings Plankton back to the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: [flying by Plankton] Morning.
Plankton: Morning…
Mr. Krabs: And don't forget your rube goldfish device! [picks out the machine and hurls it away] There we go.
[Plankton lands at the front doors of the restaurant as usual. But as he got back up, the machine runs on him. Plankton crawls out from under the doors. Plankton straightens his out his back before entering the main room.]
Plankton: Honey, I'm home. [sees SpongeBob's aquarium near the doors] What's this stupid thing?
Karen: Those are SpongeBob's sea chimps. You don't need to bother with them. I'm going back to my shows now. [turns on the screen and watches her soap opera through the mirror; she sees two women fighting and slapping each other] Oh, my!
Plankton: Hmm. Huh? Sea chimps, huh? [gets a closer look through the glass and sees sea chimps continuing their happy-go-lucky lives] Wait a minute. Maybe I've been going about this world conquest thing all wrong. Maybe I should start small and work my way up! [cackles evilly]
[The scene changes to Plankton climbing up the aquarium wearing a shrinking belt.]
Plankton: This shrink belt will allow me to walk among those little monkeys. [turns the dial and shrinks smaller] Alley-oop!
[Plankton jumps and dives down the aquarium. He dives through the clouds and cackles evilly once more before landing in a pile of bananas. One sea chimp, mistaking him for a banana, grabs Plankton, peels his skin and prepares to eat him.]
Plankton: Too small, too small! [turns dial, makes himself bigger, and pulls himself out of the sea chimp's mouth] Huh?
[All of the sea chimps look at Plankton with bizarre looks. They had never seen another creature that is not of their kind in their aquarium before. Plankton then examines the sea chimps and notices that he's taller than them.]
Plankton: [giggles] Hey, why are you idiots so short? [picks up a sea chimp and forms it into a ball; he bounces it and throws it away] You afraid of me? You gonna cry?
[Plankton flicks a baby sea chimp's banana lollipop to the ground and makes it cry. All of the sea chimps run around in fright, screeching and chattering. Plankton grabs three sea chimps and ties them up together.]
Plankton: Listen here, you pint-sized twerps. I'm taking over your monkey town, see? [the sea chimps chatter nervously] Do you little cretins have a king or a queen or something?
[The sea chimps push one of their kind to show Plankton their ruler. It is a purple sea chimp with a gold crown.]
Sea chimp king: Um, I am the king.
Plankton: Yeah? Well, now I'm the king! [takes the crown from the sea chimp king and puts it on his head]
Sea chimp king: Wow! [shakes Plankton's hand] Thank you, sir! I mean, sire. [hops away] I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king-ing-ing!
Plankton: Why was that so easy? It's so easy because I'm so big and smart! [buffs up his muscles] That's why! [slips on a banana peel and falls backwards] Well, what are you all waiting for? Follow your leader! Fall! [the sea chimps obey their "king" and fall on the ground]
[The scene changes to Plankton taking over the aquarium's castle. He decorated the throne room with portraits and statues of himself. Some of the portraits have Mr. Krabs and Karen on them. Plankton is sitting on his new throne and has made the sea chimps his loyal servants. Some of them gave Plankton their gold and jewelry.]
Plankton: That's right, bring me all your valuables. [an elderly sea chimp holding a big bowl of bananas reveals dentures in his mouth] What are those? Dentures? Hand them over. [the old sea chimp gives Plankton his dentures and puts them in his mouth] Now that's more like it. I want to be the only one in town with stuff! [slips on another banana peel and falls backwards, losing his dentures and crown; the sea chimps fall down as well; Plankton picks up the crown and puts it back on] I'm tired of walking. Carry me!
[The scene changes to the sea chimps carrying Plankton on his throne. Plankton is eating grapes. He takes a grape and throws it in one of the sea chimps' face.]
Sea chimp child: Father! [goes back to licking her lollipop]
Plankton: [laughs] Right in the head! You guys are idiots. I'm the smart one. I've got the best ideas. Hey, you! Here's a grape-flavored idea! [picks a grape and throws it] Hi-yah! [throws three grapes at three sea chimps] Okay, that's enough. I'm bored.
[The sea chimps set Plankton down. Plankton rides a motor bike out from the castle window and drives down the village.]
Plankton: Yeah! [points to various sea chimps as he gloats and drives] I rule you, I rule you, I rule you. I rule you, you, you, and you. [crashes into a fire hydrant and is sent flying onto the back of an old sea chimp lady] Ow! [the sea chimps look at him in confusion] Ta-da! Piggyback for the king! Let's see how fast this old lady can go. [pulls on the old sea chimp lady's hair and kicks her] Hi-yah!
[The old sea chimp lady runs and gallops around like a horse.]
Plankton: Yee-haw! Today, sea chimps, tomorrow, the world! [as Plankton rides the old sea chimp lady down the path, one sea chimp pops out from a bush and shoots a dart] I rule you, I rule you, [gets hit in the head by the dart] and I...rule...you...
[Plankton falls backwards and groans on impact as the screen turns black. Plankton wakes up from his coma and finds himself tied in between two sacrificial poles.]
Plankton: Hey, what is this? Where am I? Okay, ha-ha. Very humorous. Having a bit of fun with the king, [chuckles] I get it. I think my armpits are dry now. You can cut me down. [the sea chimps continue to stare angrily at Plankton] I demand you obey your king! Let's go! Come on, you little bozos! Get me down! [the sea chimps no longer listens to him] Guys? My people? Loyal subjects? [gulps nervously] Buddies?
Sea chimp king: Oh! Hello! Remember me? You took my crown and became the new king? I just wanted to say thanks again. Oh, and, uh, have a nice sacrifice! [leaves]
Plankton: Sacrifice?
Sea chimps: [chanting "tongue"]
Plankton: Tongue? That's a weird request. But as king I'll be benevolent. [sticks out his tongue; suddenly, drops of water come raining down; one drop hits Plankton's eye] Gah! What in Neptune's navel?!
[Just then, as the sea chimps continue chanting, a giant pink tongue descends downward from the clouds and begins attacking Plankton.]
Plankton: [dodges the tongue's attacks] Hey! Whoa! [gets licked by the tongue] Yuck! Time to un-shrink! [tries to reach the dial on his belt, but couldn't due his hands being tied up] Can't...reach...I take it back. I don't want to be king!
Sea chimp king: Nuh-uh-uh! No takee-backsees.
[The tongue closes in on Plankton. The sea chimp king runs off to prevent himself from being licked. Just as the tongue was about to attack again, Plankton bites the tongue and sends it packing.]
Sea chimps: Aww!
Plankton: What do you mean, "aww?" Don't aww!
[The scene cuts back to the Chum Bucket. It turns out that the tongue belongs to Patrick. It also turns out that Patrick was the one trying to eat SpongeBob's sea chimps, not Gary.]
Patrick: Ow! [pulls his tongue back out of the aquarium] That hurt! [his tongue was a severe bite mark; he giggles] Now that snack's got a bite. [picks up the aquarium and drinks the water]
[Due to Patrick moving the aquarium, the sea chimps fall down Patrick's throat. Three sea chimps bind together like barrel monkey toys to prevent themselves from falling further. Plankton is left dangling above Patrick's mouth.]
Sea chimp king: Oh, don't worry, sire! I will cut you loose from the sacrifice. [gnaws on the rope that's holding Plankton's right hand]
Plankton: Hey, stop! Nice old chimp king. Don't do that!
[The sea chimp king cuts through the rope and Plankton swings to the other sacrificial pole. Plankton sees most of the sea chimps descending down Patrick's throat. Patrick continues drinking the aquarium's water. The sea chimp king saws the other rope that's holding Plankton's left hand.]
Plankton: Huh? How did you get over there? [the sea chimp king cuts the rope and Plankton falls] Ahh!
Sea chimp king: [falls alongside Plankton] Hey, you're welcome!
Plankton: Hey, dumbbell! [takes off his shrink belt] Take this end of the belt and wrap it around all the other falling numbskulls and bring it back to me! [stretches the shrink belt] It stretches. Go! [they both wraps the shrink belt around the other sea chimps] You morons should cushion my fall nicely.
[Plankton and the sea chimps all fall down Patrick's throat. Just then, SpongeBob comes back from the Krusty Krab and enters the Chum Bucket. He sees Patrick drinking the aquarium water.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Oh, oh, oh! Patrick! It was you trying to eat my sea chimps the whole time.
[Patrick puts the aquarium down and exit the Chum Bucket in a huff. SpongeBob follows him outside.]
Patrick: I can't believe you'd accuse me of-of-of such a delicious thing! [belches and his stomach rumbles]
[SpongeBob hears his sea chimps chattering in Patrick's stomach.]
SpongeBob: I hear 'em in there. [forms an ear and listens carefully]
Sea chimp king: [inside Patrick's stomach] Hey, King, what's this dialy-doodle-mojig on your belt do?
Plankton: [inside Patrick's stomach] No, don't touch that!
[The sea chimp king turns the dial on Plankton's shrink belt and Patrick's body begins growing and expanding.]
Patrick: Whoa-oh-oh-oh! [the growing stops and it gives Patrick a bad taste of indigestion] I take it back. They weren't that delicious.
[The sea chimp king crawls out from Patrick's mouth.]
Sea chimp king: Whoa! Hey, guys, come on out! There's more room out here.
[All of the sea chimp crawl out of Patrick's body. Patrick flips himself over and sticks his tongue out. Plankton appears to be partially digested and bruised from being inside Patrick's stomach.]
Plankton: [his right antennae is damaged] Partially digested antennae.
SpongeBob: Welcome, sea chimps. I'm SpongeBob, your owner.
Sea chimp king: Forget it, man. We're through with owners, and kings, and aquariums. Whoa! Now that looks like a swell place to live.
[All the sea chimps run into the Chum Bucket. Karen comes out with banana peels all over her monitor.]
Karen: [screams] Plankton! Abandon bucket!
Plankton: Well, that's a write off. [takes out a remote and pushes a button]
[The button activates the Chum Bucket's hand. The hand picks up the restaurant and spins it around and around. The hand throws the restaurant out into the distance with the sea chimps still inside.]
SpongeBob: Bye, sea chimps! Have a good flight! It was so nice of you to help relocate the sea chimps, Plankton. You rule!
Plankton: Not today, SpongeBob. Not today. [takes out his crown] But...someday! [puts it on and cackles evilly before Patrick swallows him and burps out the crown]


[The episode begins on a stormy night in Bikini Bottom. Above the city, two clouds come to life as the sun rises.]
Cloud father: [yawns and looks at his watch] Whoa. [wakes up his cloud wife] Hmm. [points to their next destination]
Cloud mother: Oh!
[The two clouds float away, but they accidentally left a small baby cloud behind. The baby cloud wakes up from its slumber.]
Drizzle: Huh? [whimpers and sees neither of his parents] Ma? Pa? [cries a small rainfall over the town]
Gale Doppler: I'm Gale Doppler with the big weather! Well, just as I predicted, those severe thunderstorms are moving to the southeast, and I guarantee it's gonna be nothing but sunny skies for the rest of the week. [takes off his raincoat to reveal his summer attire] This is Gale Doppler, and I broadcast the forecast that's never wrong! [reveals to be on TV] Heh, heh.
SpongeBob: [running on the treadmill] Huh? [gets tangled up in the treadmill] Whoa-boing! [crashes into the wall] Hah! Sunny skies all week? [his eyes become yellow like the sun] Hot diggity! [runs to the window, but to his surprise, he sees rain falling; his eyes then turn black] Rain. [grabs a photo of Gale Doppler] But-but Gale Doppler is never wrong. Huh? Hm.
[SpongeBob runs outside to check to see if it is raining.]
SpongeBob: [mumbles] What...? [sees a waterfall of rain] Hm? [looks up and sees the baby cloud crying] Aw, it's a little baby storm cloud. Hello, little cloud. Nice to meet you.
Drizzle: [crying]
SpongeBob: Oh, you're crying. I thought you were raining.
Drizzle: Huh? [hides behind one of the pineapple's leaves]
SpongeBob: Oh, now don't be scared. SpongeBob knows just what a growing storm cloud needs. [brings in a pot of steaming hot water] Hot steam. [kisses, sets the pot down and goes back into his house]
[The baby cloud comes out from the leaves on the roof and slurps down the hot water. SpongeBob watches the cloud in the water from inside his house. He comes back out through the front door.]
Drizzle: Huh? [hides behind the house]
SpongeBob: Well, okay, I don't see any clouds, so I'm just gonna take a walk.
Drizzle: Huh?
SpongeBob: [whistles as the baby cloud casts a shadow over him] Tut-tut, it looks like rain. Hah! [the baby cloud disappears before reappearing in front of him] Oh, hello there. [the baby cloud licks SpongeBob like a dog] Aw, who's a cute cumulous? [hugs the baby cloud] I always wanted to have a pet cloud formation. I gonna name you... [gets sprayed in the face by the baby cloud; gasps] Drizzle. [giggles as Drizzle floats around him  and plays with him]
[Drizzle picks up SpongeBob and shows the viewing of Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: Hey, good visibility!
[Drizzle absorbs SpongeBob into his cloud body and rains him down to the ground. SpongeBob laughs and Drizzle blows a gust of wind in his face. Drizzle's wind causes SpongeBob to lose his pants.]
SpongeBob: [imitating Gale Doppler] And gusty winds from the southeast.
[SpongeBob and Drizzle laugh. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Drizzle playing in Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob is laying on the ground and Drizzle is forming shapes for SpongeBob to guess. Drizzle forms into a boat.]
SpongeBob: Um. A clam eating a telephone.
[Drizzle forms into something off-screen.]
SpongeBob: A fur chandelier!
[Drizzle forms into a boot.]
SpongeBob: A lamp!
[Drizzle forms into a treasure chest.]
SpongeBob: A shoe factory!
[Drizzle forms into a globe.]
SpongeBob: A continental breakfast!
Drizzle: Ooh. [forms into a dog]
SpongeBob: A chicken!
Drizzle: [moves its mouth but clucks like a chicken instead of barking like a dog]
SpongeBob: Oh, I am so good at this.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob taking Drizzle for a walk. They both stop at a fire hydrant and run into a civilian who is walking his worm. Both Drizzle and the worm snarl at each other. The worm barks ferociously. But Drizzle lets out a blast of cold ice from his mouth, freezing the worm and its owner.]
SpongeBob: Sorry. Ee...
[SpongeBob and Drizzle continue walking as the civilian and his worm crumble into ice particles.]
SpongeBob: Bad Drizzle. Bad. [Drizzle nuzzles up against SpongeBob] Well, all right, not that bad. Okay, let's go home. [hops on Drizzle's back and rides home]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob tying Drizzle to a pole outside his house.]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Drizzle, but you can't go in the house until you're housebroken.
[Gary is looking out the bedroom window and is all wet from Drizzle's rain.]
Gary: [closes the blinds] Meow.
SpongeBob: I'll check on you later. [goes back into the house]
[Drizzle struggles to break free from the pole, but it is no use. So, it creates thunderbolts and burns the pole to a crisp.]
Drizzle: Whoo-hoo! [flies away]
SpongeBob: It's later! [holds out a bowl of hot water] Who wants a steaming hot bowl of steam? [sees Drizzle gone] Ah! Drizzle! [the bowl of hot water falls on his head] Yow! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! Where art thou, Drizzle? Oh, what unfortunate forecast be this? [sees Drizzle flying away, crying] Oh, wait. There he goes. Come back, Drizzle! Come back! [follows Drizzle]
[Drizzle is in the middle of Bikini Bottom's intersection, dodging incoming boats left and right.]
Drizzle: Whoa!
Mary: Oh, get off the road!
[A truck hits Drizzle and sends him spinning. Another truck sends Drizzle spinning into a random pet store. When he comes out from the pet store, he turned gray and rained snails and worms similar to the phrase "raining cats and dogs." The citizens run in panic as snails and worms fall on them.]
Nat Peterson: [covered in snails and worms] It's raining snails and worms! [trips over Gale Doppler and runs off]
Gale Doppler: [takes off his sunglasses and pulls out his microphone] That's impossible! I called for sunny skies and for 35 years I broadcast the forecast that's never wrong. [snails and worms fall on him]
[The snail and worm begin fighting each other and Gale is getting pummeled by them. Nat comes back and takes the microphone.]
Nat Peterson: This just in: Gale Doppler is wrong! [removes a worm from his head and puts it on Gale's head before leaving]
Gale Doppler: [laughs awkwardly] Huh? [turns and sees Drizzle causing mayhem in town]
[Drizzle is zapping thunderbolts at everyone and blows them all around.]
Gale Doppler: [rips off his summer attire] Ah! I see the trouble now, folks. That is what they call an unpredictable storm front. [Drizzle turns back to normal and flies away] But don't worry. [pulls out a leaf blower and turns it to suck] I'm gonna suck him right out of the sky to save my reputation, after these messages.
Debbie Rechid: Are you constipated? Sure, we all are. [holds up a plunger contraption] Thank goodness there's new—
SpongeBob: [interrupts the commercial] Drizzle! Drizzle, where are you? Excuse me. Have you seen a little storm cloud about yea big?
[Drizzle continues running around town and tries to hide from Gale Doppler. Drizzle hide behind a billboard, hoping that Gale would never find him. However, Gale finds him and sucks him in his leaf blower.]
Gale Doppler: I got him! Naughty nimbus, nobody messes with my flawless forecasts. It's back to sunny skies for Bikini Bottom. [prepares to blast Drizzle away, but SpongeBob passes by]
SpongeBob: Drizzle! Drizzle! Drizzle! [finds Drizzle in Gale's leaf blower] Oh, there you are, Drizzle. [gasps] Gale Doppler! [shakes his hand] You're my favorite well-eyed weather man! Oh, thanks for finding my lost pet, Mr. Doppler. Time to go home, Drizzle.
Gale Doppler: I'm sorry, square face. This cloud is a danger to the public. And I'm sending him straight to cloud heaven. [turns on the leaf blower and blows Drizzle away, but sucks him back; he laughs] I'm Gale Doppler, and I control the weather. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Hey, Doppler. [appears to have his own leaf blower] You're not the only one who knows how to use a leaf blower, sucker. [turns on his leaf blower and sucks Drizzle out of Gale's]
[SpongeBob and Gale go out on a little tug of war with Drizzle using their leaf blowers. Just then, a kid comes in. SpongeBob gives the kid his leaf blower and takes Drizzle. SpongeBob runs to a corner to hide from Gale. SpongeBob then disguises Drizzle as a wig so they could fool Gale as he runs by. But that didn't fool him at all. He sees through SpongeBob's disguise and prepares to suck Drizzle. But SpongeBob activates his leaf blower inside Drizzle and blows away.]
SpongeBob: We did it, Drizzle. We put a stoppler to the doppler. And I predict sunny skies for the rest of our lives.
[Drizzle gets pulled away by something and SpongeBob falls into a mailbox in the street.]
Drizzle: Huh?
[Drizzle is being sucked by an even bigger leaf blower attached to a construction machine operated by Gale Doppler.]
Gale Doppler: Ooh! That's a nasty low pressure system from the north!
[SpongeBob comes out of the mailbox and coughs up random letters and a package. Drizzle cries out for help as he is being sucked in the machine even further. SpongeBob runs over to Gale Doppler and falls to his knees.]
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Doppler, don't send Drizzle to cloud heaven!
Gale Doppler: That's just an expression. He's not going anywhere.
SpongeBob: Phew, that's a relief.
Gale Doppler: [moves the machine over the dehumidifier] I'm gonna drop him in this dehumidifier and dissolve him.
Drizzle: [screams]
SpongeBob: Dissolve him?! What?! [hops onto Gale's head and holds his eyes shut] Please, Mr. Doppler! Drizzle's a good cloud! He doesn't deserve to dissolve! [cries a fountain of tears]
Gale Doppler: I've got zero visibility. Let go of my eyes, square face!
[SpongeBob's tears fall onto Drizzle into the sucker.]
SpongeBob: [sobs] Drizzle!
[Suddenly, SpongeBob's tears cause Drizzle to grow bigger and turn gray. Drizzle's growth destroys the sucker. Gale finally gets to remove SpongeBob off his face. He turns around and sees Drizzle forming thunderbolts and blowing winds. SpongeBob gets up and nervously runs away, sensing that Gale made him mad.]
Gale Doppler: I'm in the middle of a severe thunderstorm—[gets hit by a stop sign] And we're bringing it to you li—
[Drizzle blows the microphone into his cloud body. Drizzle zaps Gale and flies right in his mouth and into his body. Gale is lifted in the air and he coughs up the microphone.]
Gale Doppler: I'm Gale Doppler, and I actually am the weather! [laughs, but thunder rumbles in his body and rain falls; it appears that Drizzle is now taking control of Gale's body and is making him do what he what him to do] Huh? Uh-oh.
SpongeBob: Uh-oh. [pulls his right leg and makes an umbrella]
[Drizzle floats Gale back into town and makes him blow wind everywhere. Drizzle then makes Gale's body freeze.]
Gale Doppler: [shivering] My body is cold!
[Drizzle makes Gale create a blanket of snow over the town.]
Gale Doppler: I don't want to be the weather anymore. It hurts! [Drizzle produces thunder and lightning in Gale's body, making him wail in pain]
SpongeBob: [comes out through the roof of one of the buildings] Excuse me, Drizzle. I don't mean to parade on your rain, but could you please put Gale down?
[A gust of wind blows SpongeBob into the sky.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [screams and lands on top of a bigger storm cloud; he gets up and sees two bigger storm clouds] Huh? Oh, no! Not more storm clouds.
Gale Doppler: [as Drizzle makes him fly around] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[The two bigger storm clouds create a loud thunder to get Drizzle to stop.]
Gale Doppler: No!
[Drizzle turns Gale around and comes out from his mouth.]
Drizzle: What? [sees his cloud parents and laughs] Aw. [flies over to his cloud parents and hugs them]
SpongeBob: Holy hurricane, they're Drizzle's parents!
Cloud father: [pats Drizzle on the head] Mm, mm. [mutters sternly to not stay behind again and looks down to see Gale] Hmm? [his thunder rumbles]
[Gale is dangling on Drizzle. He takes out his microphone.]
Gale Doppler: You know, everybody complains about the weather, but my next guests actually do something about it. Did you two always want to be storm clouds?
[Gale points the microphone at Drizzle's cloud parents. They were not very happy for the way Gale treated their son.]
Cloud mother and Cloud father: [inhales and blows Gale away]
Gale Doppler: I'm Gale Doppler, and I could probably use an ambulance, [gets blown off into the distance] right about now! [lands in the dehumidifier, which causes it to explode]
[The sun begins the rise and the cloud family start to leave for their next destination.]
SpongeBob: Good-bye, my little foul weather friend. I'll never forget you, come rain or shine. [blow kisses]
Drizzle: Huh? [turns back and gives SpongeBob a smaller storm cloud as a token of appreciation for his kindness]
SpongeBob: Aw, thank you, Drizzle. Don't worry, I'll water him and walk him every day.
Drizzle: [waves good-bye and goes to rejoin his cloud parents] Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Bye! [looks at the smaller storm cloud] Aw, I'm gonna name you Drizzle Jr. [Drizzle Jr. licks him like a dog just like his father, Drizzle did earlier in the episode] And I know just where to keep you too.
Everyone: Aww!
Gale Doppler: [reveals to have survived the explosion and is completely burned] Aww. [groans]
[The scene changes back to SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is preparing to start the day as usual and is going to take a shower. He opens the shower curtains and climbs into the tub.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Drizzle Jr. Not too hot but not too cold.
Drizzle Jr.: Uh-huh. [produces rain for SpongeBob to shower]
[SpongeBob sings in opera while washing himself, ending the episode.]


SpongeBob: Ta-daaa! [SpongeBob's house dances around] I did it! I did it! I did it! I did- [slips on something and makes silly noises] [smashes into the door and when it opens SpongeBob falls out and makes a funny noise]
Gary: [slithers toward SpongeBob] Meow.
SpongeBob: [circles around Gary] I learned a magic trick!
Gary: [gets scared and hides in his shell] Meow? [his eyes come out of his shell]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, but I've been trying to learn this trick since I was a SpongeBoy. [gasps as Gary meows] I gotta show Patrick! [starts running toward Patrick's house and hits Norton]
Norton: [spits out mail]
SpongeBob: [finishes running toward Patrick's house and knocks on his rock] Patrick, come on, I got to show you something! [slides into Patrick's rock and makes a silly noise. He then lifts up Patrick's rock.] Patrick? He's not home. [Patrick's rock falls on him and he makes a grunt-like noise] Oh! Squidward! [Squidward goes into his trash can and slides it into his house and pretends like he's not home] Squidward! Squidward, Squidward, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward, Squidward, Squidward?
Squidward: If he thinks I'm out, he'll go away. [SpongeBob continues to say "Squidward" and his eye goes through Squidward's door.]
SpongeBob: [talks through his eye] Squidward! I'm so glad you're home. Got a magic trick to show ya!
Squidward: I hate magic.
SpongeBob: How could anyone hate magic? It's... [close-up of his face] ...magical.
Squidward: [sighs] Okay, show me the trick.
SpongeBob: [gasps in joy as Squidward runs away] Pick a card- oh. [Squidward runs out of his house, closes the door, and swallows the key. Squidward hums] Watch closely, Squidward. The hand is quicker than the eye.
Squidward: [groans and swallows his eyes] Can't watch. No eyes. Sorry.
SpongeBob: [groans and drops his cards] I want to show my trick to somebody. [cries and runs away while Squidward laughs and bumps into his front door]
Mrs. Puff: [scene changes to Mrs. Puff having a student with braces take a drivers test] You're the best driving student I've ever had, Rodger. Kudos. [Rodger laughs]
SpongeBob: [as he's running to Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: [scared] Rodger, we have to move now! Punch it! [as the boat is driving, she accidentally hits a fire hydrant] I think we lost him. [SpongeBob arrives with the cards in his hand. Mrs. Puff makes a small scream]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, you got to see my magic trick! [Mrs. Puff and Rodger scream and the boat crashes onto a rock. Rodger's braces break, while SpongeBob stands up with his cards] Pick a card, any card!
Mrs. Puff: Hold on, SpongeBob, I have a trick to show you first. [Mrs. Puff puffs and she floats into the air] Sorry, Rodger, we'll pick this up next week!
SpongeBob: [hanging onto Mrs. Puff] Wait, Mrs. Puff, you didn't see my trick!
Mrs. Puff: [frowns] Okay, show me the trick already.
SpongeBob: [gets off Mrs. Puff and shows his cards] Pick a card, any card! [SpongeBob falls down and slams onto Sandy's treedome. He slides down the treedome happily until he reaches the floor] Sandy! [goes inside the treedome and puts on his water helmet] Sandy, I gotta show you this. [he shows his cards] Pick a card, any card! [SpongeBob screams and drops all his cards as Sandy, who is watering her grass, is missing her head] Sandy? [SpongeBob touches the helmet and it falls off. SpongeBob looks to see where the head is] Where's your head?
Sandy: Oh, sorry, SpongeBob, didn't mean to spook ya. My head's in another dimension, observing. [cuts to Sandy in the Swamp, observing one of the trees. In the background, Bubble Bass and Patrick are on a log, trying to escape a group of alligators on their hovercraft]
SpongeBob: [leaving] Uh-huh, okay, I'll come back later when you have a head.
Sandy: It should be back by Thursday. Friday at the latest. [she starts watering her grass again]
Mr. Krabs: [SpongeBob runs to Mr. Krabs' house and rings the bell] Who is it? [opens his door]
SpongeBob: [shows his cards] Pick a card, any card! [Mr. Krabs gets frightened]
Mr. Krabs: [he smashes SpongeBob's head, making him bounce up and down and make music like an accordion] Magic, eh, boyo? [he leans his eyes toward him] Is this by any chance a trick where you produce money coins from behind people's ears? [as he's winking twice] Wink wink, hmm?
SpongeBob: [crouches down a little] No.
Mr. Krabs: Then what's the point? [closes his door angrily]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gets upset] Ah! [goes to Fred's home and rings his doorbell, which is a miniature leg]] Hi, Fred! [shows his cards] I've got a magic trick that's going to dazzle you!
Fred: [looks with interest] Ooh! Are you going to saw my leg in half, or make it disappear, or pull a rabbit out of it?
SpongeBob: [loses his smile] Uh, no, this isn't going to involve your leg.
Fred: [quickly looks at his watch] Ooh, gotta go, SpongeBob. I'm washing my thighs tonight. [goes inside and closes the door, only to accidentally cut his leg because of the door, while SpongeBob is surprised] My leg!
SpongeBob: [sighs as he walks into a kelp forest] Why won't anyone watch my trick?! [falls onto the ground while the word "trick" flies into the air, causing the leaves on the kelp trees to fall down onto SpongeBob] [SpongeBob gets up, covered with leaves. He slightly pulls his kelp mustache, and then sees two pieces of wood and a rock. A lightbulb appears on top of SpongeBob] Hey, that gives me an idea! [scene cuts to SpongeBob putting the final touches on his rock people] There. Good evening, folks, I am the Great Spongedini! Now watch closely, [reveals his cards] the hand is quicker than the eye. Pick a card. Any card. [SpongeBob inhales all the magic playing cards into his mouth, and then starts his magic trick.]
[The magic trick starts when the kelp forest turns into a white screen as SpongeBob turns into magic playing cards, which then transform into a buzzsaw and cuts a copy of SpongeBob in-half, and then a rainbow appears. Then ten cut in half/rainbow-colored SpongeBobs, two green, two yellow, two pink, two red, and two blue, each holding one magic playing card start running out as the rainbow disappears. Then, two other SpongeBobs, one on the bottom of the screen, and the other on top of the screen being upside down, start leading a bunch of card people from the top, and the bottom of the screen. Then, two other card people start going over and under each other five times, becoming SpongeBob, and back to a playing card. Then the camera zooms out to see lots of card people on the screen, which then fades to SpongeBob. wearing a magician's outfit, a magic hat on top of his head, and a magic wand for a nose, which automatically makes some flowers come out of it, The Great Spongedini then takes the magic wand out of his nose and turns it into three metal rings, that are linked to each other. Then, The Great Spongedini puts himself through the rings, and then, the rings transform into a cannon that shoots out three colorful fireworks. One pink, one yellow, and one blue. Then, The Great Spongedini appears on the screen again, and then notices a red ribbon stuck through his left sleeve.]
The Great Spongedini: Huh? [The Great Spongedini pull the ribbon out of his left sleeve, but then reveals a red, blue, pink, green, and orange ribbon that covers the whole screen. Then the scene becomes spirally and gets put into a magic hat. Then, the white screen turns back to the kelp forest and SpongeBob pulls himself out of the magic hat in a pink bunny suit, ending his magic trick.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! [notices that the audience he made was fake and didn't respond to his magic trick.] Oh... I still wish Patrick was here to see it. [then he notices Patrick sitting on a mushroom, hanging onto another mushroom.]
Patrick: [off-screen] I saw it, SpongeBob! [on-screen] It was astonishable! [Patrick falls of the mushroom and falls flat onto the ground, and pulls himself off the ground.]
SpongeBob: [hugging Patrick] Oh, Patrick! You showed up just in time. What was your favorite part?
Patrick: Uh... My favorite part was... uh..."Ta-da!". I missed everything before that.
SpongeBob: Oh, then you haven't seen seen anything yet! [he grabs ahold of Patrick's hand. The two spin around and then they disappear into a magic hat. Some confetti and a card come out of the hat as the two laugh. Fireworks also start coming out of the hat, while the rock creatures stand inanimate.]


[The episode begins at Mr. Krabs' anchor house early in the morning. A clam crows like a rooster. Mr. Krabs is getting himself prepared for a new day.]
Mr. Krabs: [yawns and takes off his robe] Oh, yeah. [climbs into his bathtub to shower] There we go. [turns the faucet and begins to bath in the shower]
[Inside the medicine cabinet, Plankton squeezes out of the toothpaste tube.]
Plankton: Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! [talks through walkie-talkie] Fluoride to Desktop, I'm in a position to raise no suspicion, over.
Karen: [through walkie-talkie] Cut the poetry, Wordsworth. Did you get Krabs' hair sample yet?
Plankton: Keep your pants on, woman! I'm gonna steal his hairs right out of his razor. [chuckles as he grabs a razor and goes to take some hair]
[Suddenly, Mr. Krabs opens the cabinet door.]
Mr. Krabs: I'll just grab the razor here...[grabs Plankton]
Plankton: Wait! No! [gets dragged against Mr. Krabs' face with his teeth] Auugh!
[Plankton spits out a hairball of Mr. Krabs' hair.]
Plankton: [coughs] Ehhh! [rubs the hair off his tongue]
[Mr. Krabs holds Plankton up to the shower head and fills his mouth up with water.]
Mr. Krabs: Now for the rest of it. [uses Plankton to shave his back hair]
[The scene changes to Karen reading a book while she's waiting for Plankton. Plankton comes in.]
Karen: Well, if it isn't my thieving husband. So did you bring me the— [sees Plankton's mouth full of hair; she picks it up and removes the hair from Plankton's mouth] Hair? [takes a sample of hair and throws the rest away] I only needed one.
[The scene changes to Plankton leaning on the glass of his machine.]
Plankton: Hee-hee-hee! You married a genius, Karen. Using the DNA of Krabs' hair and my own DNA from my antennae— [his antennae gets snipped off by Karen] Ouch! [his antennae is placed in the machine] I will create a combo-clone of me and Krabs to finally steal the secret formula! [pulls up the lever and cackles]
[The machine turns itself on and fuses the hair sample and antennae sample together. The cloning machine turns on and creates a single being with Krabs' and Plankton's DNA together. The being turns into a blob and the machine turns off.]
Plankton: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Behold PlanKrab!
[The machine opens the door and the being steps out.]
PlanKrab: Heh-heh-heh.
[The smoke clears to reveal the being. It appears to be a clone with Mr. Krabs' body and Plankton's head.]
PlanKrab: Arr-arr-arr-arr-arr!
Karen: How is this a good thing?
Plankton: Wake up, Karen! The Plankton side will know everything the Krabs side knows! It'll be easier than taking candy from a baby.
Karen: Mm, and we know how successful that was. [turns on the screen to show Plankton trying to steal a lollipop from a baby, but ends up getting sucked on]
Plankton: This is different! Isn't it, PlanKrab, my pretty? Now, here's my plan.
PlanKrab: Don't waste your breath, Plankteron. I already mapped out the perfect plot to swipe that formuler-ererer!
[PlanKrab gives Plankton a high-five before leaving for the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: Great! See you soon, P.K.! [sighs] I love that guy. Well, half of him anyway. [laughs until he coughs] Still got a hair in there.
[The scene changes to Plankton waiting for PlanKrab at the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: Where is PlanKrab with the secret formula? It's been over three minutes already! [gets stepped on by Colonel Carper]
[PlanKrab walks to the door and notices Plankton on the ground. He picks Plankton up.]
Plankton: All right, Two-Face, what's the big idea? What have you been doing all this time?!
PlanKrab: Oh, nothing much-erer. Just stealin' the formuler-erer… [shows Plankton the Krabby Patty formula]
Plankton: Uh-whaaa? [his eyebrow falls off in surprise]
PlanKrab: Taking over this restaurant-erer…
SpongeBob and Squidward: [both happy and wearing new hats] Hooray for PlanKrab! He's the best boss ever!
PlanKrab: And kicking Krabs out on his booty-erererer! [points to Mr. Krabs looking through the window in depression]
Plankton: B-b-but how?!
PlanKrab: All it took, me hearty, was a hearty handshake. The world's persuasive handshake, that is! [holds his hand out] It's me latest creation. Put her there-erer, matey.
Plankton: An evil handshake. That's hands down the dumbest thing I ever— [puts his hand on PlanKrab's hand] Huh? [feels tiny hands giving his hand nice, gentle massages and spa treatments] Oh. Ooh. Heh-heh, yeah. Oh, ooh, ahh, ahh. Yeah, yeah. Ahh! Yeah. Ohh-ho-ho! [lets go of PlanKrab's hand] Oh, your handshake is exquisite! I'd believe anything you say.
PlanKrab: [turns Plankton around] Then believe this, swabby. [steals Plankton's deed to the Chum Bucket] I'll also be commandeer-ering the Chum Bucket from now on.
Plankton: Ahh—ahh. Sounds great to me, P.K.
PlanKrab: And I'm afraid your services are no longer required-ererered! [throws Plankton in the air]
Plankton: Gosh, I still can't get over this handshake. [gets booted out of the Krusty Krab and is sent flying in Mr. Krabs' coffee mug] I'm over it now.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps upon seeing Plankton in his mug] Plankton! [sets Plankton down] Some creepy one-eyed crab took me restaurant! [sobs really hard]
Plankton: Wait a minute. I think he took mine too! [sobs alongside Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: I-I-I don't know what happened. But that was some handshake of his, huh? I mean...hoo—hoo!
Plankton: Snap out of the handshake! It's a trick, Krabs! [slaps Mr. Krabs in the face] A dirty, beautiful trick!
[Suddenly, a truck with a crane comes by. It implants something on the top of the Krusty Krab. The cover pulls itself up and reveals to be the Chum Bucket. Only this time, it says Krusty Bucket in place of the word, "Chum." The sign opens to reveal the word, "The Krusty Bucket." Plankton and Mr. Krabs scream in terror upon what they're seeing. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and Plankton eavesdropping on the Krusty Bucket to see what PlanKrab is doing.]
Nat Peterson: [eats a patty] Say, this Krabby Patty tastes even better than usual. What's in it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, it's the same old patty, except now each one has a pinch of chum added.
Plankton: A pinch of ch-ch-ch-chum?
PlanKrab: [gives SpongeBob the soothing handshake] Good work, me boy-o.
SpongeBob: [heavily breathes] Wow! [faints]
Mr. Krabs: Me boy-o?
[Mr. Krabs and Plankton both sob a rainfall of tears. Storm clouds roll by and rains on both the depressed Mr. Krabs and Plankton.]
Plankton: [sighs] There's only one way to get our restaurants back, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] You don't mean...
Mr. Krabs and Plankton: We gotta work together...!
[The rain floods on both Mr. Krabs and Plankton.]
Plankton: [coughs] Hair.
[The scene changes to PlanKrab taking out the trash. He locks the back door and goes to get rid of some of the trash bags. But little did he know, Mr. Krabs and Plankton are hiding in the garbage can between the brick walls. They're planning on to stage a surprise attack on PlanKrab. They both chuckle and give each other a high-five.]
PlanKrab: [comes to the garbage can in between the brick walls] Hey, what the...
[A brawl is heard from between the brick walls. The fighting stops. Mr. Krabs and Plankton come out with the key, but they both end up collapsing to the ground. PlanKrab comes out unscathed and takes the key. Mr. Krabs and Plankton growl angrily. The scene goes back to the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: He may have taken our restaurants, but we'll take his customers!
[Fred sees signs that says the Krusty Bucket is closed and are pointing to something else in another direction. Fred walks over to Mr. Krabs and Plankton's stand, buys a patty, and leaves. Mr. Krabs and Plankton chuckle, thinking they've won.]
PlanKrab: [holding a drive-thru sign but points it to Plankton and Mr. Krabs] This way! Drive-thru! Literally.
[Mr. Krabs and Plankton get run over by a passing truck. PlanKrab then heads back into the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: All right, all right! I can't go any lower, Eugene! Please make it stop!
Mr. Krabs: [picks Plankton up] It looks like there's only one way out of this one, Sheldon.
Plankton: Oh, no! You don't mean...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. I'm afraid so.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and Plankton sitting in PlanKrab's office. SpongeBob is acting as a moving fan for PlanKrab.]
PlanKrab: That'll be all for now, Spongematey.
SpongeBob: Oh, could I just have one more handshake, Captain?
PlanKrab: [chuckles] Sure as yer born. [gives SpongeBob the soothing handshake]
SpongeBob: Ooh…. [melts and slithers back into the kitchen]
PlanKrab: So you two scallywags want to work for me, eh?
Mr. Krabs and Plankton: I wanna be the manager! [both growl angrily]
PlanKrab: Well, you're both in luck. It just so happens I'm looking for two new manager-erers…
Mr. Krabs: Ahh!
Plankton: Yeah!
[The scene changes into the Krusty Krab restrooms. PlanKrab gives Mr. Krabs and Plankton working hats and toilet brushes.]
PlanKrab: To manage me toilets! [chuckles and leaves]
Mr. Krabs: [removes the hat] Well, here's another fine mess you've gotten us into.
Plankton: [whimpers and coughs] Hair.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and Plankton scrubbing the toilets with toilet brushes.]
Plankton: The humiliation in here stinks!
Mr. Krabs: This is all your fault, Plankton. I'm gonna keel haul yer face at lunchtime!
Plankton: Why wait? Let's take a coffee break! [throws a coffee maker onto Mr. Krabs] Pow!
[Mr. Krabs' eyes pour out of the coffee maker. Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton and pushes him against a fast-moving toilet paper roll. Plankton pushes Mr. Krabs into the toilet and gives him a swirly flush.]
Plankton: [laughs] Swirly!
[Mr. Krabs pulls himself out of the toilet and is all twisted. Mr. Krabs and Plankton then gets into a massive brawl. One customer, Administrator Flotsam, is hearing the commotion from the other side.]
Administrator Flotsam: Hey, I'm trying to read! [Mr. Krabs and Plankton plows through the curtain] Ahh! Hey! [gets caught up in the brawl]
[Outside, PlanKrab is giving Squidward the soothing handshake. Squidward happily faints into his register boat.]
Administrator Flotsam: [runs out of the restroom] Two guys...fighting...toilet paper everywhere! [runs away]
PlanKrab: [gets angry and pulls up his sleeve] Oh, yeah? [kicks the restroom door open and enters] Who's defiling me rester-ereroom?!
[The doors fall down and sees Plankton and Mr. Krabs fighting on the toilet.]
Plankton: He did it!
Mr. Krabs: He did it!
Mr. Krabs and Plankton: No, he did it! No, he did it! No, he did it! [continuously bickering]
[PlanKrab gets so confused at what he's getting at. When all of a sudden, he splits his heads into half. One head is Green PlanKrab and the other head is Red PlanKrab.]
Green PlanKrab: Get off of him, Plankton!
Red PlanKrab: It was obviously Krabs' fault!
Green PlanKrab: Why are you siding with Plankton?!
Red PlanKrab: Why are you siding with Krabs?!
Plankton: They're arguing!
Mr. Krabs: And splitting up!
Green PlanKrab: Stop hitting myself! [hits Red PlanKrab]
Red PlanKrab: Ow! [hits Green PlanKrab] Stop hitting myself! I'm sick of you! [bashes into each other's heads]
Green PlanKrab: What in Neptune's name is wrong with meself?!
[The two heads keep on fighting and going on each other's throats with their arguing.]
Mr. Krabs: Jeez, is that what we sound like?
Plankton: I hope not, 'cause that's pathetic.
Green PlanKrab and Red PlanKrab: [continuously hitting each other] I can't stop hitting myself, because I'm torn!
[Green PlanKrab and Red PlanKrab split into two separate beings. They both growl angrily each other until Mr. Krabs and Plankton breaks them up while blowing whistles.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you clones, I want a clean fight. No rough stuff. Go back to your corners when the bell rings and come out fighting.
Plankton: But first, you gotta shake hands.
Green PlanKrab: Well, fine.
[Green PlanKrab and Red PlanKrab give each a handshake. And, at the same time, they end up getting the same massage and spa treatment that the original PlanKrab gave out earlier. Green PlanKrab chuckles warmly.]
Red PlanKrab: Wow, this is a great handshake.
[Green PlanKrab and Red PlanKrab both melt into puddles on the floor, leaving nothing but their severed hands.]
Plankton: Splitting? So soon?
[Mr. Krabs and Plankton laughs heartily.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you. [laughs]
Plankton: [coughs] Hair.
Mr. Krabs: Here, me bucko. Let me get that for ya. [steps on Plankton to cough out a hairball]
Hairball: [chuckles] Freedom!


[The episode begins with Sandy working on her latest invention in her treedome. SpongeBob, who appears to have a goofy look on his face, is helping.]
Sandy: Laser wrench.
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm. [hands her a hammer]
Sandy: Nope.
SpongeBob: Ah. [hands her a screwdriver]
Sandy: Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Mm? [hands her a pair of underwear]
Sandy: Not even close.
SpongeBob: [laughs as he paddles Sandy's head with a paddle ball]
Sandy: No. No. No.
SpongeBob: Oh! [honks a horn in Sandy's face]
Sandy: [grabs the horn] Ugh, fine! It'll do. [screams the horn on her invention]
[The doorbell rings.]
Sandy: Hm?
SpongeBob: I'll get it! [answers the door and another squirrel comes in]
Rosy Cheeks: Surprise! [removes her diving helmet and her three children enter the treedome] Hi-ya, sis!
Macadamia: [removes her diving helmet] Howdy!
Hazelnut: [removes her diving helmet] Auntie!
Pistachio: [removes her diving helmet] Sandy!
Sandy: Oh! I didn't expect y'all till tomorrow.
Rosy Cheeks: I know how much you love your nieces y'know, so I brought 'em a day early.
Sandy: SpongeBob, this here's my sister, Rosy and my three nieces. [points to her niece in a red dress] This'n here's Macadamia.
Macadamia: [curtsy] How do?
Sandy: [points to her niece in a yellow dress] Hazelnut.
Hazelnut: [twirls around and curtsy] How do?
Sandy: [points to her niece in a green dress] And little Pistachio.
Pistachio: How d—[belches and giggles in embarrassment]
Sandy: Girls, this is my friend, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Aww, what sweet little angels!
Rosy Cheeks: [laughs nervously] Yeah, angels. Okay, well I gotta skedaddle. [puts her diving helmet back on, exits the treedome, inflates her suit, and floats to the surface] Freedom!
Sandy: [talks quietly to SpongeBob] Doggone it. They're too early! I'm not finished with their present!
SpongeBob: [puts on a cowboy hat and a fake mustache] Don't worry your pretty little head, little lady. I'll watch the gals until you're done!
Sandy: [removes SpongeBob's hat and fake mustache] Thanks, SpongeBob, but there's something I gotta tell you about babysitting my—
SpongeBob: [closes Sandy's mouth and chuckles] Yeah, I think I know a little something about babysitting, Sandy.
[A flashback shows SpongeBob babysitting Patrick in his pineapple house. SpongeBob pats Patrick on the back like a baby and Patrick belches. Back in reality, SpongeBob makes hand motions and belches like Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [shrugs in embarrassment] Excuse me.
Sandy: Y'all mind your Uncle SpongeBob now. [takes her invention and heads into her tree]
SpongeBob: [pulls up the picnic table, scoops up the three nieces and sits them down] Story time! [blows up an inflatable book and begins to read it] Goldyfish and the Three Sea Bears. Chapter one, breaking and entering.
Macadamia: [pops the inflatable book and pouts] Don't waste your breath...
Hazelnut: [pouts] And don't make a hassle...
Pistachio: [pouts] Some kids like to read...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: But we'd rather wrassle!
TV Announcer: Wrassle match!
SpongeBob: Now you girls go easy on me, okay? [giggles]
Macadamia: [arm wrestles SpongeBob and flips him over] One!
[SpongeBob gets up and goes to arm wrestle Hazelnut.]
Hazelnut: [arm wrestles SpongeBob and crushes his hand] Two!
[SpongeBob's hand and fingers is crumbled into dust. SpongeBob waters his hand and it replenishes back to normal. SpongeBob then goes to arm wrestle Pistachio, but she was too strong for him to handle. Pistachio yawns in boredom. She knocks him upward and shatters the picnic table. She throws his severed arm and SpongeBob crashes into Sandy's tree.]
SpongeBob: Ow!
Sandy: [comes out of the tree when she heard the ruckus and shakes her head] Ugh. [picks SpongeBob up and puts him back together as she walks him to the door] Why don't ya show the girls around town?
SpongeBob: Great idea! [places bubbles on their heads so they have enough air to breathe] I'll take them to the funnest place in all of Bikini Bottom!
[The girls merge together and form a huge smile. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab and the girls smile turns into a frown.]
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab! [the girls detach themselves and Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, these are Sandy's little nieces.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nieces, eh? And what brings such cute little customers to Bikini Bottom?
Macadamia: We're visiting Auntie Sandy…
Hazelnut: And we want to sling hash...
Pistachio: A chophouse like this must be...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: [their eyes have dollar signs on them] Loaded with cash!
Mr. Krabs: Aww! Go on! No, really. Go on.
[Mr. Krabs and the girls stare for a while until they turn and head to the register. Pistachio gives Mr. Krabs a death ray, saying that she's watching him. Squidward is knitting a beautiful sweater for himself at the register.]
SpongeBob: [sneaks up behind Squidward and accidentally causes him to tear his sweater apart] This is my coworker-slash-best buddy, Squidward.
Squidward: Ugh! Children.
Macadamia: Ugh! Grown-ups.
Hazelnut: This feller ain't happy.
Pistachio: Just look at his face.
[Squidward's face appears ugly looking.]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: We're gonna be sick all over the place!
[Squidward groans. The scene changes to SpongeBob making a meal for the girls in the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Here you go! Three Dolly Patties.
[Hazelnut sprays ketchup into SpongeBob's face to make him look like Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: [imitates Mr. Krabs]
[Hazelnut sprays relish, ketchup and mustard all over the kitchen.]
Squidward: Can you stop playing dress-up long enough to make some Krabby Patties?
[The girls spray mustard into Squidward's face to make him look like SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Huh! Guess that's me all over. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [comes in the kitchen and laughs] You two look ridiculerous!
[The girls spray ketchup, mustard and relish on Mr. Krabs to make him look like Plankton.]
Squidward: Ha! You're your own worst enemy.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, from now on, babysit off Krusty Krab Property! [SpongeBob backs away in embarrassment] And Mr. Squidward, dress like SpongeBob on your own time.
[SpongeBob and the girls exit the restaurant.]
Macadamia: That place really stunk.
Hazelnut: It was lamer than lame.
Pistachio: Take us somewhere fun.
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: [holds up brass knuckles with spikes on them] Or taste Texas pain!
SpongeBob: Aww, what cute little knuckles you have. Hmm, hmm... ooh, I've got just the spot.
[The scene changes to Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob and the girls are in bathing suits.]
SpongeBob: [inhales] Ahh, smell that fresh seawater.
[Macadamia taps on the bubble to show SpongeBob they can't smell.]
SpongeBob: Oh, heh-hey, right. Sorry.
[SpongeBob throws the blankets in the air and it magically flips onto the girls. The umbrella lands next to SpongeBob along with the picnic basket and sand bucket. The girls layback and relax in the sun.]
SpongeBob: [yawns] See, Sandy, nothing to worry about. Baby-sitting is eaaaaasy. [falls fast asleep]
[Moments later...]
Macadamia: Hey, Uncle SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? [closes his eyes]
Hazelnut: Open your eyes!
[SpongeBob wakes up and closes his eyes.]
Pistachio: You're just gonna love...
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Hm? [sees a sandcastle built over him]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Our sandy surprise!
Macadamia: It's our gift to you!
SpongeBob: Well, isn't that sweet!
Hazelnut: And it won't wash away...!
Pistachio: [holds up a trowel] 'Cause it's made of concrete!
SpongeBob: Concrete, what?! [gets up] Good structural integrity girls, but a little tight!
Macadamia: So, sorry, Uncle.
Hazelnut: We made it too small...
Pistachio: But we'll get you out...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: With this wrecking ball!
SpongeBob: [Scared] Wrecking what?!
[Pistachio bashes SpongeBob in the head a couple of times, giving him a really long bump on his head. The bump reaches the surface next to Bikini Atoll. A seagull lands on top of the bump. SpongeBob pulls himself out of the sand.]
SpongeBob: [dizzy] Let's all go to my house and take a little break. [moans and walks away with the girls]
[The scene changes to the girls skipping around SpongeBob tying his bump with ribbons.]
SpongeBob: Here we are, girls. Pineapple, sweet pine— [opens the door and Patrick with a horrible look on his face as if he didn't sleep for weeks] Whoa!
Patrick: I've been waiting all day to watch your TV! [backs up inside as his face gets eerie]
[SpongeBob and the girls enter the house.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you could have watched it while I was out.
Patrick: I forgot how to make it work! [shakes SpongeBob's television] Show me! Show me funny! I wanna see stories! Go, go! [sobs] Please!
SpongeBob: [turns the television on] Boop. There you go.
[The television shows a funny black and white comedy show.]
Patrick: [rubs his head and stupidly] I don't know how you remember all this technical stuff.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Patrick, meet Sandy's nieces.
Patrick: [flies over to SpongeBob's chair] Good to meet ya! [sits on the chair]
[A squirrel hand puppet is shown.]
Squirrel hand puppet: [on TV] Hey, kids, know what time it is? [smashes an acorn] It's nutcrackin' time!
Patrick: [giggles] I love this episode!
Macadamia: Well, well, what do you know?
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Patrick is watching our favorite show!
[The girls move over to the television so they can watch it.]
SpongeBob: Ah, finally, I can relax. [holds up a mixer in the kitchen] With work!
[SpongeBob turns on the mixer and starts to make a batter for his brownies. The batter splatters all over the kitchen. SpongeBob licks the batter from his eyes and body. Back in the living room, Patrick is having a hard time seeing the show due to the girls blocking the view. He huffs in anger. He gets up from the chair to see the show. But Pistachio's tail blocks his face. He moves himself and the chair in front so he can see.]
Patrick: Ah, that's better.
[The girls growl angrily. They move themselves in front of Patrick and stack each other up.]
Patrick: [angrily] Aww!
[Patrick hops his chair in front of the girls. He laughs at the show. The girls climb onto Patrick so they can see the television. Patrick growls angrily and activates the chair's lever to get the girls off. He snickers evilly and scoots himself in front of the television.]
Macadamia: Let's launch this goof...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Right to the roof!
Macadamia: [chuckles as she grabs the chair's lever] Lift-off!
[Macadamia launches Patrick upwards and the girls laugh.]
Patrick: [flies through the roof] Whoo! [falls back down] Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: [comes in with a plate full of brownies] Who wants brownies? [Patrick falls on SpongeBob and eats the brownies before bouncing backwards] Heh. I'll go make another batch.
[The girls laugh at the show before Patrick falls back onto the chair.]
Macadamia: Let's send this nitwit...
Hazelnut: On his way!
Pistachio: Before he ruins our whole dern day!
Macadamia: [holds up a hangman's noose] Yeah!
[The girls merge together and form a huge evil smile. The scene changes Pistachio tying a rope to the end of the bus.]
Bus driver: All aboard for Glove World!
[Macadamia ties the rope to Patrick and the chair. The bus begins to drive away and drags Patrick with the chair.]
Patrick: Save me a brownie!
Macadamia: He'll be away...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: The whole dern day!
[The girls fistbump and proceed to watch television. But much to their misfortune, Patrick returns with a group of people wearing gloves on their heads.]
Patrick: Hi! I brought some friends.
[Patrick and everyone else enter the house and move in front of the television, blocking the girls' view once again. SpongeBob comes back in with a new batch of brownies.]
SpongeBob: [sees more people in his house] Ooh! I'll have to make more brownies! [goes back in the kitchen]
Macadamia: [fed up with Patrick's stupidity and selfishness] All y'all shoo! You're blocking our view!
Bikini Bottomites: [nervously back away] Excuse us. Sorry. Sorry, ma'am.
Hazelnut: We're taking that seat...
Pistachio: Right where you sit!
Patrick: What you gonna do?
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Let's wrassle for it!
TV Announcer: Wrassle match!
SpongeBob: [as the referee] Ready, set...wrassle!
[The bell rings. Patrick and the girls struggle with all their might. They both look as they were equally matched due to their strength. But just as the girls were about to win, Patrick spots a brownie on the table.]
Patrick: Ooh, brownie! [slaps the girls' hands down on the table, which inexplicably helps him win the match]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Huh?
Patrick: You saved me one! Thanks! [eats the brownie] Guess I get the TV. [chuckles evilly]
Macadamia: That guy's mean!
Hazelnut: Where's our auntie?!
Pistachio: We gon' leave!
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: [tears fill up their bubbles as they cry] We want Sandy!
[The girls run back to Sandy's treedome, crying their eyes out.]
Macadamia: Oh, Auntie Sandy, what a terrible place!
Hazelnut: Everyone was so mean!
Pistachio: Right to our face!
Sandy: [sympathetically] Aw, don't fret, little ladies. I made a present just for you, [pops Macadamia's bubble] you, [pops Hazelnut's bubble] and you. [pops Pistachio's bubble]
[Sandy pushes the button on the invention she was working on and it forms into a castle-shaped bouncing house.]
Macadamia: From a rattlesnake's tail...
Hazelnut: To an armadillo's chest...
Pistachio: Our Auntie Sandy...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Is the gol'durn best!
[The girls go and play on the bounce house just as SpongeBob enters the treedome without his water helmet.]
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Sandy. [begins to dry up due to not wearing a water helmet] I guess I'm just not a very good babysitter.
Sandy: [puts a water helmet on SpongeBob] I tried to tell ya the first rule of babysitting my nieces.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Sandy: Don't babysit my nieces!
[SpongeBob smiles in embarrassment, since he should have listened to Sandy in the first place. Sandy pushes another button and turns the bounce house into an inflatable submarine, trapping the girls inside.]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Bye, Auntie Sandy! Bye, Uncle SpongeBob!
[The submarine exits the treedome and floats away to the surface. SpongeBob and Sandy wave goodbye. But despite everything SpongeBob went through with them, his eyes teared up as he smiles happily.]
Sandy: Bye-bye! Have a nice trip back to Texas! [quietly whispers to SpongeBob] Bless their evil little hearts.
[Back in Texas, Rosy is submerged in a pool relaxing as she is enjoying her time off from her children.]
Rosy Cheeks: Ahhh... [the submarine's shadow looms over her; she gasps] Oh, no.
[The submarine crashes on top of Rosy and her children are happily bouncing up and down in front of her.]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Hiya, Ma! Did ya miss us?
[Rosy sighs in distraught and the episode ends.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The customers are running wild with hunger and are gnawing everything in sight. A barrel crashes onto Mr. Krabs' office door.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! [dodges an incoming axe] What is happening in me restaurant?!
Squidward: The customers have gone crazy! [screams as Monroe was thrown in the kitchen] SpongeBob is late for work, so there's no food!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps then grabs and shakes Squidward] But he's never been late for work in his life! Oh, this can only mean one thing. [hops on a table and rings the bell] SpongeBob has passed away!
[The customers pause for a moment and cry.]
Mr. Krabs: Or...maybe he's just seriously injured. [chuckles]
[The customers cry once more.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah, that's still bad, isn't it? [sobs along with the customers]
Squidward: [files his tentacle] I had no idea you cared that much about SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Squidward] Of course! He's been a loyal employee. His passing would be a great loss to me bank account. Oh, I—to me personally, of course. Now, come on, we have to go check on SpongeBob's possible remains.
Squidward: With pleasure! [smiles sadistically; but Mr. Krabs stares angrily at him] What? Too soon?
[The scene changes to SpongeBob's pineapple. The sky is gray and the scenery looks gloomy. Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and the customers are outside SpongeBob's bedroom door.]
Mr. Krabs: Prepare yourselves for the horror. [the customers quiver, but Squidward gives a sadistic smile] Or the joy. Let's not be downers about this.
Bikini Bottomites: Oh, yeah. Okay.
Mr. Krabs: But probably, like I said, the horror!
[The customers gasp while Squidward grins maliciously. Mr. Krabs peeks in through the bedroom door. Inside, SpongeBob is still in bed with Gary sleeping on him. Gary is licking SpongeBob to get him to wake up.]
Mr. Krabs: Neptune's nightmare! That snail is eating SpongeBob's face! [rushes over to SpongeBob's bed and grabs Gary] Get away from him! [pulls Gary off of SpongeBob]
Bikini Bottomites: [overlapping chatter] Such a nice kid.
SpongeBob: [wakes up] I—I— [babbles and shakes his head before the lights turn on] Oh, good morning, everyone.
[Everyone gives SpongeBob disappointed looks and they all walk out. Mr. Krabs and Squidward stay behind to talk to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] SpongeBob, you're alive!
SpongeBob: I am? Well, thank goodness. Wait, why wouldn't I be alive?
Mr. Krabs: [sets SpongeBob down] You were late to work, so we assumed the worst.
Squidward: [rolls his eyes in annoyance] You mean, "the best."
SpongeBob: Late to work? But that's impossible! My trusty alarm clock always waked me up. [holds up his alarm clock] See? [sees it unplugged] Well, how do you like that? It's unplugged. Well, we'll just fix that and I'll never be late again.
[SpongeBob goes to plug his alarm clock back in. But the alarm clock falls over and goes bouncing around the bedroom. SpongeBob hides under the covers to prevent himself from getting hit. The alarm clock bounces back from the bed and flies under Squidward. The alarm clock bounces back from a wall and hits Squidward in the back of his head, breaking it into bits of pieces.]
SpongeBob: [catches Gary] Oh, my clock!
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs stand up and see pieces of the alarm clock everywhere. The blowhorn part of the alarm clock is stuck through Squidward's neck. Squidward falls over and the blowhorn breaks.]
Mr. Krabs: Looks like you need a new clock, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Oh, I could never replace my old clock, Mr. Krabs. We've been through a lot together. [hugs the remains of his alarm clock] It's the only alarm clock I've ever owned. I can fix it.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, good luck. But you better not be late tomorrow. [leans in closer to SpongeBob's face] Or else.
Squidward: [rubs his head] Did that stupid clock give me a bump on my head?
[Squidward shows a clock-shaped bump on his head. A woman screams in the background.]
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: [grossed out] Ugh!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob trying to fix his broken alarm clock.]
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, come on. I still love you. Let me fix you. [flicks the part] Wow!
[The clock part flies into Patrick's mouth. Patrick wakes up from sleeping and swallows the part.]
Patrick: Ooh, hey, SpongeBob, what're you doing? [hops off his rock and goes over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm just trying to fix this old alarm clock. I'm gonna need that part you swallowed, by the way.
Patrick: That's cool. Just give a couple of hours. You know, [looks through SpongeBob's magnifying glass] I could totally fix your clock for you. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know, Patrick. This clock means a lot to me and— [sees Patrick making an eager giggle] Well, okay, are you sure?
Patrick: Absolutely. Don't you worry. I promise to be super careful. [grabs some parts and tries to put them together, but they don't fit; he smashes them together in frustration] Why don't you fix?! [screams wildly as he grabs the blowhorn and smashes everything in pieces until he stops] Hmm? Uh... Sorry, SpongeBob, I couldn't fix it.
SpongeBob: Thanks for trying, Patrick, but I guess nothing lasts forever. Looks like I'm gonna need a new clock after all.
Patrick: Hmm! [laughs] In that case... [kicks some parts around and body slams them]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the clock store. He enters the store and loads of clocks are hanging on the walls.]
SpongeBob: Um, hello?
Con man: [pops out of the coo-coo clock] Hello, there! [shakes SpongeBob's hand] Welcome to Clock World, where we always have time [shows an alarm clock under his hat] for a bargain. How can I help you?
SpongeBob: [holds out a bag of the remains of his alarm clock] Do you have another alarm clock like my old one?
Con man: Hmm… [takes some of the clock's remains, licks it and examines it] Ah, the 740 Foghorn Wake-Em-Up Grand. I'm sorry to say they don't make this model anymore. But if you have a second, [shows SpongeBob a vast amount of clocks] I have many others I can show you. [giggles]
SpongeBob: Wow. So many to choose from. [his eyes are shown as clocks] Oh, I'll never be able to choose a clock with this many choices. I'll just take 'em all! [takes out a bunch of money and gives them to the salesman]
Con man: Ah! I'm rich! [laughs manically as he leaves the clock store] Whoo! [rushes over to the yacht store and gives the money to the yacht salesman] Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! [hops into a yacht and drives away]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting a fire hydrant alarm clock.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: My old foghorn clock was the only alarm clock that could wake me up. Sure hope one of these works. [shows a huge pile of alarm clocks he bought] Goodnight, Gare-bear. [hops into bed and goes to sleep]
[Gary goes to sleep as well. The next morning, the fire hydrant alarm clock goes off and scares Gary. The firefighter figure sprays water in SpongeBob's body, making him bigger. But SpongeBob continues to sleep.]
French Narrator: One hour later...
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? [panics and rushes over to the Krusty Krab, but trips over due to being to big from absorbing the water]
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant. Mr. Krabs is angry with SpongeBob while Squidward finds this very amusing.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Late.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting his punching bag alarm clock.]
SpongeBob: I hope this one works. [hops into his bed and goes to sleep]
[The next morning, the punching bag alarm clock unzips itself. A bell is heard in the background and a boxing glove punches SpongeBob out of bed, injuring him in the process.]
French Narrator: Late again...
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant again, this time on a wheelchair. Mr. Krabs is still angry with SpongeBob while Squidward still finds this very amusing.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob's cast] Late!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sleeping in his bed with his jellyfish hive alarm clock set. It goes off and jellyfish fly onto SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gets stung by the jellyfish]
French Narrator: You get the idea!
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant again with his body all puffy from the jellyfish.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Late! [shows SpongeBob on fire with a late paper] Late! [shows SpongeBob with a clam eating his head and with a late paper on its shell] Late! [shows SpongeBob as a pile of dust on the ground with a late flag] Still late! [shows SpongeBob with arrows sticking through his head and a late paper] Late! [shows SpongeBob getting late papers all over his face] Late, late, late, late, late, late, late!
Squidward: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Still late. [smiles maliciously at SpongeBob as he whimpers ]
Mr. Krabs: Late again. [the papers fall off of SpongeBob] I told you before that you best not be late or else! But this time, I'll be emphasizing it with a furrowed brow. [looks closer at SpongeBob] Or else.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sitting in his chair, thinking about what Mr. Krabs said.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know how many more "or elses" I can take. [looks at the alarm clock next to him] I have to figure out a way to wake up on time.
[The alarm clock rings. Gary meows excitedly and runs over to his food bowl. The feeding machine pours snail food into his bowl and Gary eats it.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what a great idea!
[SpongeBob gets up from his chair, takes all of the alarm clocks and goes off to do something with them. It took him all night long until morning arises. SpongeBob, who is now tired, goes back into his house. He climbs into bed and goes to sleep. Just then, the alarm system rings loudly and shines 6:00 down at him. The punching bag alarm clock punches SpongeBob out of his bed and lands into a wagon. The fire hydrant alarm clock sprays water at the wagon and sends SpongeBob to the door. The cuckoo clock ejects a boot and gives the wagon a little push. Outside the house, a loud thud and buzzing noise is heard. A clock with a spring pushes SpongeBob out from the front door. SpongeBob then rolls himself down the street into downtown Bikini Bottom. The street line of clocks push SpongeBob gently further down the street with their pendulums. SpongeBob rolls over to a clock in the middle of an intersection. The giant hand pushes SpongeBob to the other side. SpongeBob rolls through a painting scene that looks similar to The Persistence of Memory painting. Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and Squidward are anxiously waiting for SpongeBob to arrive.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, I really thought that last "or else" would've worked. Maybe I should've wagged my finger.
[SpongeBob continues to roll down the street. The wagon stops and gets sucked into the sand. The sand turns out to be part of an hour glass. The door of the hour glass opens and SpongeBob rolls out while covered in sand. Sand flies off of SpongeBob's face. The wagons rolls SpongeBob right past Mr. Krabs and Squidward and into the front doors of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is really happy that SpongeBob made it to work while Squidward stood there in complete disbelief.]
Mr. Krabs: Right on time! [turns to another sponge named SpongeTom while Squidward groans in defeat] Looks like I won't be needing you after all, SpongeTom.
SpongeTom: [drops his spatula] Oh! [stomps away]
[SpongeBob rolls into the restaurant and crashes into the register boat. SpongeBob flies into the kitchen and kicks a plank, knocking over a barrel.]
SpongeBob: [half awake] Good morning...
[The barrel hits SpongeBob's head and puts his working hat on. SpongeBob continues to sleep as some wood burns on the grill, giving away some smoke. The smoke goes up the chimney, activating the log-shaped cuckoo clock. The clock's archer figure shots an arrow at Gary.]
Gary: Meow! [groans as he pulls the roll for SpongeBob's contraption]
[It turns out that SpongeBob spent the entire night at the Krusty Krab, building a contraption out of the alarm clocks he bought. The contraption is made to create Krabby Patties for the customers. As ingredients are being hung over a rope, one clock uses its pendulum to cut the patties in pieces. One cuckoo clock blasts fire at the patties. A lighthouse clock rolls out the buns. One clock spirts mustard and ketchup on the buns. All of the ingredients fall into the funnel and form into Krabby Patties. One patty falls on a catapult. It flings the patty toward a sleeping SpongeBob. SpongeBob's snoring blows a bubble for the patty to fly into. The bubble with the patty inside floats over the window. It pops and the patty falls on the plate, ringing the bell.]
Squidward: [takes the patty and gives it to the customer] Sadly, it looks like your order's on time today. [gives the customer the patty and the bell rings again for the next order] D'oh!
[The customer sticks a dollar in Mr. Krabs' pants.]
Mr. Krabs: [gleefully giggles and goes into the kitchen with his pants full of money] Glad you finally woke up on time, boy-o! [laughs as he leaves the kitchen]
[SpongeBob continues to sleep while the contraption continues making patties.]
SpongeBob: [sleepily] Just five more minutes, Gary. [leans over until Gary pushes him up]
[Squidward gives another customer a patty. Just then, Bubble Bass cuts in front of the line.]
Squidward: Sir, there's a line.
Bubble Bass: I'm filing a complaint. [holds out his half-eaten patty] I ordered this with extra pickles. And I only count fourteen.
Squidward: [places Bubble Bass' patty on the window] SpongeBob, we got a wrong order.
[SpongeBob continues to sleep. His snoring blows a bubble and floats a patty to the window. The bubble pops and the patty lands on the grill, setting it on fire. The fire builds up so much power in the chimney that is makes the wood-shaped alarm clock shoot various arrows at Gary. Gary yelps in pain and runs off while pulling the contraption's rope. SpongeBob's clock contraption goes haywire and it clogs up the funnel, making it explode and leaving the kitchen a total mess.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes in after hearing the explosion] What in Poseidon's beard?!
SpongeBob: [gasps as he finally wakes up] Oh! Oh! Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's not a good morning. First, you're late for days, and now you destroyed me kitchen!
[SpongeBob looks around and sees the mess the kitchen is in. SpongeBob giggles nervously at his angry boss.]
Mr. Krabs: [looms his angry eyes down at SpongeBob] Oh, looks like it's—
SpongeBob: [sweating nervously] Time for "or else?"
Mr. Krabs: You better be at work on time or else [calmly] I'll have to open up and close the restaurant an hour later.
SpongeBob: [confused] Uh, what? [gets upset] No! [falls to his knees as Mr. Krabs smiles maliciously at SpongeBob]
[Suddenly, Patrick comes into the kitchen.]
Patrick: I did it! [shows SpongeBob the alarm clock and it's fixed]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Yes! Oh, Patrick, you fixed it!
Patrick: Uh, kind of.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sleeping in his bed the next morning. The foghorn alarm clock rings with Patrick making sound effects in the blowhorn. SpongeBob and Patrick share a good laugh and the screen turns black, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket. Karen is pacing back and forth, waiting for something to be delivered. As she paces, her monitor continuously sparks. Karen groans impatiently and numbers scroll on her screen. At that same moment, Plankton comes in.]
Plankton: Karen, I— [gets run over by Karen]
Karen: [gasps] Oh, sorry, Planky-Bear! [picks Plankton up] I'm just a little distracted waiting for our baby to be delivered.
Plankton: Oh, well, that makes sense. [beat] A baby?! I don't want a baby!
Karen: It's too late to stop it now. [shows the marketing website on her monitor] It's been nine months and the baby is no longer on back order. [shows the order button, which clicked into in stock, then scrolls up to show the out for delivery button]
Plankton: Can we ask for store credit instead? [gasps as he sees the stork drone outside]
[The stork drone flies over the Chum Bucket with Karen's baby. The drone rings the doorbell.]
Karen: My baby's here! [laughs]
Plankton: Not if I have anything to say about it.
[Plankton hops onto a computer and activates the Chum Bucket's hand. The hand closes the roof and goes to fight the drone. The drone holds out a laser and zaps the hand away, opening the roof in the process. The drone drops the bundle and Karen's happily catches it. Karen unwraps the bundle to reveal the baby, which happens to be a little calculator.]
Karen: [giggles and happily squeals] Oh, Planky-Poo, look how cute our baby is!
Plankton: Oh, please, that thing isn't even a graphing calculator. Weak.
Karen: Oh, come on. [holds out her baby] How can you look at our baby's itty wittle keyboard and say he's not the cutest? [gasps as an exclamation point shows on her screen] I have the perfect name for him. Well, don't you wanna know the name?
Plankton: Not really.
Karen: It's Chip. [shows the word "chip" on her screen, then shows an old computer chip] He's named after my grandfather.
[Chip starts to cry.]
Plankton: [groans] Great, here we go with the crying! Will you please hush that thing up?!
[Karen taps on Chip's buttons and Plankton groans angrily. Suddenly, Chip stops crying.]
Karen: There you go. All better.
Plankton: Wow, how did you do that so fast?
Karen: Simple, I just typed 4-4-4-5 in his cute little keyboard.
Plankton: I don't get it.
Karen: [turns Chip upside-down and the numbers show the word, "Shhh" on it.] Shhh.
Plankton: [groans and continues his work] At least it can't get more annoying.
SpongeBob: [giggles as he flies in with a present] Hello! [giggles and a background audience is heard cheering]
[Plankton groans angrily and stomps over to Karen and Chip.]
SpongeBob: [giggles] A little drone told me you two are new parents. So, I just had to bring over a little present for the baby. Hello, baby. [gently rubs Chip's face, making him giggle]
Karen: Oh, I think little Chip likes you.
Plankton: Obviously not the brightest diode in the box.
SpongeBob: Look, Chip, your uncle SpongeBob got you a little something. [opens the present and reveals a can of compressed air] It's a can of compressed air to keep your keys nice and clean, like this! [pushes button and the sprayer flies out, nearly hitting Plankton]
Plankton: Phew.
[The sprayer bounces on the wall and flies back at Plankton, knocking out his eye. SpongeBob giggles, pushes the button on the compressed air can and flies out of the Chum Bucket. The scene changes to Chip, who has appeared to have grown arms and legs, learning how to walk. He goes to walk, but falls down.]
Karen: Come on, walk to Mommy.
[Chip stands up and goes walking to his mother.]
Karen: That's it. You can do it.
[Chip nearly falls down, but continues to walk.]
Karen: You're walking, baby!
Plankton: [chuckles] You call that walking? This is walking. [walks around in place] This is how you do it. This is how it's done.
[Chip goes to walk over to Plankton. When suddenly, Chip's screen shows the word, "upgrade" on it.]
Karen: Ah! Mama's big boy is upgrading!
[Chip upgrades himself and grows out of his diaper and becomes a walking calculator. Chip happily runs over to Karen and hugs her.]
Karen: Aw.
[Plankton slips on some long sheet of paper.]
Plankton: Whoa, ah! [flies over to the trashcan filled with Chip's stinky diapers and groans] This stinks!
[The scene changes to Karen taking Chip to the arcade on a stroller.]
Karen: Let's see if we can find some friends for Mama's special little boy. [enters the arcade] You need to interface with someone fun. Try that video game over there. It doesn't look too dangerous.
[Chip hops out of the stroller, opens the video game's door, and enters the game. Chip appears on the video game's screen and jumps onto the submarine. Chip begins to play the game and goes to collect coins. Karen slowly starts to become worried about Chip's safety. Chip then starts to zap various stuff with the submarine's laser.]
Karen: Careful, Chip.
[Chip continues to zap the video game items.]
Karen: Uh, those monsters are too big. Come out of that game right now!
[Chip ignores his mother's warnings and starts to become more violent in the video game.]
Karen: Chip, get out of there!
[Karen knocks on the game's door, but it wouldn't budge open. She grabs the machine and shakes Chip out. Suddenly, the word, "error" appears on Chip's screen and Chip upgrades himself into a teenage video game console with a red cap.]
Karen: [laughs] So you think you can do whatever you want because you're a teenager now? You just wait until I tell your father.
[Chip makes a loud screeching sound on his screen, indicating that he said a curse word in front of his own mother.]
Karen: What did you just say to me?! [groans angrily as she grabs Chip by the button ears and takes him home]
[The scene changes back to the Chum Bucket. Plankton is still working until Karen comes in with Chip.]
Karen: I told Chip that game was too dangerous, and do you know what he said to me? [makes the same loud screeching noise as red scribbles appear on the screen]
Plankton: And?
Karen: [angrily growls and spins her monitor around] Just talk to your son! I need to cool my circuits. [leaves]
Plankton: [slides himself over to talk to Chip] Ooh, uh, hey, buddy. Heh, what you doing?
Chip: [depressed] Eh…
Plankton: Yeah, I hear you. So, uh, what happened at the arcade?
[Chip mimics every detail of what happened at the arcade. He shows that he was having a fun time playing in one of the videogames by making gun noises. Then he inhales and exhales himself, saying that his mother sucked him out. And then he shows various symbols on his screen with a dolphin sound heard in the background, saying that he said a curse word in front of his mother.]
Plankton: What? You mother stopped your game, even though you were crushing it? Your mother clearly doesn't get you, man. But I have the perfect solution to your problem. Run away.
Chip: Huh?
Plankton: Yes, I said run away. Take off, see the world. You do you.
[Chip was confused about what Plankton said. But after seeing an image of himself running away, he was happy about it.]
Plankton: Eh, now get out of here, you little scamp.
[Chip gets up and leaves the Chum Bucket. Plankton goes back to his work right when Karen comes back in.]
Karen: So, how was your talk with Chip?
Plankton: Oh, it went great. He's a good boy.
Karen: Yeah, he wh— [notices Chip is missing] Where—where is he?
Plankton: Oh, he ran away.
Karen: What?! Why would my baby run away?
Plankton: Because I told him to. Duh.
[Karen screams in an uncontrollable rage. Her hands gather up green electricity and form into a green rolling pin and a green frying pan. Plankton screams in terror as Karen goes to hurt him. Karen throws the green rolling pin at Plankton, which turns into an electric trident and pins him to the wall.]
Plankton: Karen, baby, let's be reasonable here!
Karen: [picks up the trident holding Plankton] You find our son and bring him home this instant or don't bother coming home! [her green frying pan turns into a spiked glove]
Plankton: [screams as Karen flings him out of the Chum Bucket] I'm going! I'm going!
[The scene changes to Plankton driving in a tank while searching for Chip.]
Plankton: Chip! Chip! Where are you, boy? Come to Daddy! Ugh, what am I saying? Chip! Chip!
[Little did Plankton know, Chip is sitting by himself in a dark alley near a garbage can. Just then, a strange looking machine comes out.]
Weird machine: Psst, hey, kid, you lost?
Chip: [shrugs] Meh.
Weird machine: Running away from home, huh? Cool! Why don't you come hang with me and my buddies? [grabs Chip and pushes him over to meet his friends] Oh, don't be scared. In here. Check it out, guys. I found us a new friend.
[Three other weird machines come out and all look at Chip. They all give him a friendly greeting.]
Weird machine: I know, right? It is cool here. There's just one thing. If you wanna be part of us, we're gonna need your parts.
[Chip turns and sees a machine about to be taken apart.]
Machine #1: Uh-oh. [his monitor is unscrewed]
[One of the machines takes the spare part and puts it on another machine, making it into an arm. The machine giggles happily. Chip beeps in terrible fright and goes to run away.]
Weird machine: [grabs Chip] Oh, come on, kid, don't be like that. We've all done it.
[Chip runs off to escape.]
Weird machine: Get him!
[Chip screams in horror as he tries to escape. One machine takes out a huge magnet and uses it to drag Chip back. Chip tries to fight off the magnetic pull, but ends up getting dragged backwards. He gets stuck onto the magnet and the machines prepare to tear Chip apart. Chip struggles to break free and then lets out a loud screeching sound as a call for help. Meanwhile, Plankton is still driving around, looking for Chip.]
Plankton: Chip! Your mother's gonna kill me if I can't find you. [hears the screeching sound] Huh? [his antennas act up and point in the other direction] That's him! He's in trouble! Don't worry, son! Daddy is coming! [drives the tank around and goes to the direction to where Chip's call for help is coming from; plows through the wall near the dark alley] Get away from my son! [one machine chops the tank into pieces] Get away from me!
[The machines chase Plankton around.]
Chip: Father! [breaks free from the magnet] Leave my father alone!
Plankton: [Overhearing Chip and touched] Your first word was "father." Wait until I rub this in Karen's face. [chuckles as he continues to run]
[Chip hops onto an old ice cream machine and hacks into it, making it his own tank. He then shoots ice cream at the machines, breaking several of them into pieces. He shoots ice cream onto the ground, making one of them slip and break apart.]
Weird machine: No! The delicious horror! [gets sprayed by Chip's ice cream machine] Ah!
[The scene changes back to the Chum Bucket. Plankton and Chip are telling Karen what happened in downtown Bikini Bottom.]
Plankton: Oh, you should've seen it, Karen. Chip was all like, "Stay away from my daddy, who is the most brilliant, handsome genius in the world."
Karen: [rolls her eyes in disgust] Oh, brother.
Plankton: [hops onto Chip's monitor, making him drop his ice cream] Aw, we have got the best kid ever!
[Suddenly, Chip starts going through another upgrade. As Chip upgrades, Plankton loses his balance and falls in the ice cream on the floor. Chip upgrades himself into a young adult computer with a backpack.]
Karen: Oh! [giggles] Aw.
Plankton: [pulls himself out of the ice cream] Come on, son, let your old man buy you a quart of oil. [hops onto Chip's screen] Whoo-hoo! [giggles] Yes!
Chip: [removes Plankton from his screen] Sorry, Dad, I'd love to, but I'm leaving for college. [sets Plankton down on Karen's hand]
Plankton: [gets teary-eyed] I went to college. [sobs alongside with Karen as a waterfall appears on her screen]
[Chip exits the Chum Bucket, climbs onto a bus parked to the curb, waves good-bye to his family, and drives off to college.]
French narrator: Eight semesters later...
[The scene changes to the First Nautical Bank. Chip, now a full grown adult, is working as an ATM there. Just then, Mr. Krabs comes in. But little does anyone know that Plankton and Karen are secretly spying on Chip at his first day of his job.]
Plankton: [chuckles before Karen flicks him] Ouch! Watch it, Karen! We don't want Chip to know we're spying on his first day of work.
[Mr. Krabs inserts his credit card and types in the numbers 1234.]
Chip: [scans Mr. Krabs' credit card numbers] Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[Mr. Krabs giggles excitedly and money comes out of Chip's money slot. Mr. Krabs goes to get it, but Chip pulls the money back in. Mr. Krabs does it again, but the money gets pulled back in again. He does it a couple of time, but Chip still wouldn't give Mr. Krabs the money.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what? [groans while shaking Chip]
[Mr. Krabs bangs on Chip's monitor and goes to grab the money. But discovers that Chip pulled the money back in.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! [tries to grab the money, but fails when Chip pulls them back] Hey! Give me my money! [sobs]
Plankton: [laughs while Karen smiles with a heart on her screen] That's my boy!


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [kisses some dollars] Hmm, I love you. [kisses some dollars] And I love you. [kisses some dollars] And I love you. [kisses some dollars and stuffs them in his pants] Heh—heh—heh. [money pops out from behind] And I love you too. Oooh. [laughs as money flies out of his pants and putting them in his shell] I tell ya, Mr. Squidward, today's been our [pulls down profit chart] best day of business in years. [pulls up profit chart] Yep, profits are so good, there's nothing that could possibly ruin this perfect—what?! No!
Squidward: [gets hit by SpongeBob's eye] Augh! [gets stepped on by SpongeBob] Ow!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you okay? [jumps onto Mr. Krabs, knocking all of the money on the floor] What's a matter? Is there too much money? I'll get rid of the money. [picks up the money and stuffs them in his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: What are you— [sticks his hands in SpongeBob's mouth and pulls the money out] Quit masticatin' me moolah! [stuffs his pockets with the money] I ain't upset about the money, boy. I'm upset about him. [turns SpongeBob around and points to Old Man Jenkins outside]
SpongeBob: Old Man Jenkins? But I love Old Man Jenkins! He always has old and interesting smells, [Old Man Jenkins' horrible smell withers the plants] and his bones make such funny noises, [Old Man Jenkins' bones in his legs jiggle] and his eyes are the milkiest shade of white [his eyes turn milky], and—
[Mr. Krabs shuts SpongeBob up and carries him into the kitchen while unintentionally stepping on Squidward. Old Man Jenkins walks up to the register.]
Mr. Krabs: Every day, it's the same routine...
Old Man Jenkins: I'll have...[straightens out his finger] a small coffee. [snaps his finger]
Squidward: [gives Old Man Jenkins coffee] Hmm, that'll be 25 cents.
Old Man Jenkins: I don't think so, Charlie. I get the senior discount. [holds out a penny, cuts it in half, and gives the other half to Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: [peaks out the kitchen with SpongeBob] Then he hogs that table all day... [Old Man Jenkins slurps his drink really loud, annoying the other customers] And annoys all me other customers.
Old Man Jenkins: Ahh! [smacks his lips and pours ketchup, mustard and mayo into his beard]
Mr. Krabs: And he don't buy nothin' else neither. He just makes that disgustin' condiment soup and listens to his radio, all for free. [Old Man Jenkins bangs on the radio to turn it on and sips on his "condiment soup"] And anytime someone says somethin' to him, it's always the same response...
Frankie Billy: Excuse me, could you turn the volume down on your soup?
Old Man Jenkins: Respect your elders! [hits Frankie Billy on the head]
Frankie Billy: Yes, sir! Sorry, sir! [runs off crying]
[Old Man Jenkins resumes sipping his "condiment soup."]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, it just makes me so steaming mad! [growls as a pot of soup is steaming on his back until he stops]
SpongeBob: [takes the pot off of Mr. Krabs' back] Ooh. [sniffs the soup] Ahh.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I won't stand for it no more! [stomps out of the kitchen and grabs Old Man Jenkins] It's time to kick out the coot!
Old Man Jenkins: Eh? What's going on now?
Medley: Hey! If that's how you treat the elderly, then I'm never eating another Krabby Patty in here again!
Bikini Bottomites: [murmurs in agreement] Me neither. Give the poor old guy a break.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. Uh, it's okay. I—I was just...shaking the dust off him. See? [shakes Old Man Jenkins really hard until his skeleton flies out of his skin] Ahh! Uh, wait. Let's see here. [grabs Old Man Jenkins' skeleton and puts his skin back on upside-down] Heh, there. Heh—heh—heh.
Old Man Jenkins: Respect your elders!
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins tuning up his banjo and preparing to sing.]
Old Man Jenkins: ♪Oohhhhh! Elders are you betters 'cause we're older. So all you whippersnappers get in line! Y'all best be respectful of your elders or we'll whip you with a soup spoon every time! [hits everyone including Squidward with a big soup spoon]♪
Mr. Krabs: [growls angrily and his eyes boil hot red] Ahh! [steam comes out of his shell]
SpongeBob: Well, gee, Mr. Krabs. If you want Old Man Jenkins to leave, why not just try asking him nicely?
Mr. Krabs: I think you oughta be the one to ask him nicely. [pushes SpongeBob over to Old Man Jenkins; imitates SpongeBob] "Oh, hi. I'm SpongeBob, and I love you, but will you go home, please? Hee—hee—hee—hee." [imitates Old Man Jenkins] "I'm Old Man Jenkins, and I'm a jerk who likes to cost Mr. Krabs money." [sees SpongeBob hugging Old Man Jenkins] What the? [grabs SpongeBob and pulls him back into the kitchen] What is going on, boy-o? Why ain't Jenkins vacatin' me restaurant?
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs. I couldn't ask Old Man Jenkins to leave after hearing his story. His feet hurt, [shows his sore feet] and his grandson never calls, [shows a picture of Old Man Jenkins' grandson] and he has to take a pill that helps him to remember to take his other pills. [holds up some medical pills] Why, he takes so many pills, he's more pill than man. [morphs himself into a pill and reverts to normal]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, time to step it up...to passive aggression. [chuckles evilly as he heads to the thermostat] This'll make him uncomfortable. [turns the knob to "nuclear" heat]
Bikini Bottomites: [starting to feel hot and sweaty] Ooh. Whew. Ooh.
[One customer fans himself with a Krabby Patty and dumps his soda in his pants to stay cool. One customer's Krabby Patty melts from the heat and melts along with it. Squidward is sweating up a puddle in his register boat and bails it out with a bucket. Although the heat is making everyone hot and sweaty, Old Man Jenkins, on the other hand, thinks it's cold in the restaurant and is shivering.]
Old Man Jenkins: [shivering] Ehh...ehh…. It's too cold in here for my old blood! [takes his beard off his face and uses it as a sweater] Show a little respect for your elders and turn up the heat!
[Mr. Krabs gets so mad that his entire body bursts into flames.]
Old Man Jenkins: Thank you!
Mr. Krabs: [crumbles into ashes, but gets back up] So you can take the heat, but can you take...the beat? [holds up a tape cassette]
[Mr. Krabs chuckles evilly and puts the cassette in the tape recorder. He turns up the volume and turns on the recorder. The recorder plays really loud music that everyone including SpongeBob and Squidward are bouncing up and down. The loud music shook the restaurant. Mr. Krabs turns off the recorder. But unfortunately, Old Man Jenkins was sound asleep the whole time.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps and looks into Old Man Jenkins' eye] I don't understand. How did you endure that cacophony?
Old Man Jenkins: [wakes up] Eh? [holds out a deaf horn] You say something? I'm a little deaf in my ears!
Mr. Krabs: Really? Then what's with the radio?
Old Man Jenkins: [opens the radio and shows him a cheese cracker inside] I like to cook on the vacuum tubes. [through deaf horn] Now show some respect for your elders! [munches on the cheese cracker]
Mr. Krabs: [growls and snaps off his right leg] Jenkins, I'm putting me foot down! You're ruining me business, and you're costing me money! Whoo, whoa. [puts his foot back on] Now, get out!
Old Man Jenkins: It ain't legal to throw out the elderly in this town. So respect your elders! [whacks Mr. Krabs with his cane]
Mr. Krabs: Respect...my...elders, hmm?
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins trimming his toenails.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Old Man Jenkins, I've got someone I'd like you to meet.
Old Man Jenkins: Hm? What's this about now?
Mr. Krabs: This here is me father. [shows his father, Victor Krabs] And he is older than you. So you best respect what he has to say.
Victor Krabs: Ahoy there, Jenkins. Time for you to be hoistin' your sails and movin' on, son!
Old Man Jenkins: Oh, I don't thinks so. [grabs something under the table and reveals his own father, Very Old Man Jenkins Sr.] This is my father, Very Old Man Jenkins Sr. He's even older than your old man, Krabs.
Very Old Man Jenkins Sr.: And I say we stay. Both you young 'uns should respect your elders.
Mr. Krabs: And I say both you Jenkinses should respect your elder...[opens the door and reveals Grandpa Redbeard] me grandpappy.
Old Man Jenkins: Two can play at that game. [grabs someone and reveals his grandfather, Grandpa Jenkins] Meet Grandpa Jenkins. Ha-ha!
Grandpa Redbeard: I remember the day when Krabby Patties used to cost a dime.
Grandpa Jenkins: Oh, yeah? Well, I remember when they cost a nickel. Hm?
Mr. Krabs: Okay, let's not give anyone ideas about cheap patties. Now, out with the old, and in with the even older. [knocks down a barrel to reveal his great-grandfather krabs] Right, Great-Grandpappy Krabs? Ha-ha!
Old Man Jenkins: Wake up, Great-Grandpop! [lifts the barrel to reveal his great-grandfather Jenkins] Defend the family's honor! [lifts his great-grandfather and kicks him over to great-grandfather Krabs]
Great Grandpa Krabs: Ooh, respect...someone.
Great Grandpa Jenkins: Am I an elder?
Mr. Krabs: [growls and does a spiritual ritual on the floor] Oh, Great-Great-Grandpa Krabs, return to us! I beseech thee! [the ghost of his great-great grandfather comes to life] Ha! You're older than they are! Kick 'em out!
Old Man Jenkins: [takes out a board and does his own spiritual ritual] I want to speak with my Great-Great Grandpa Jenkins! [his shell spins around and the ghost of his great-great grandfather comes to life] Get 'em, Ancient-Great-Grand-Pop!
[Mr. Krabs rubs a crystal ball and a ghost of his great-great-great grandfather comes to life.]
Old Man Jenkins: [reads an ancient book BOOK OF THE FILlETED] Youthum Ignorami, Elderus Respecticus! [his book summons the magic within and the ghosts of his ancestors comes to life]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles wildly as he sucks the ghosts of his ancestors from the graveyard] Here we go. [sucks the remaining ghosts of his ancestors and heads back to the Krusty Krab] Ha-ha! [releases his ancestors' ghosts]
Old Man Jenkins: You best respect your elders!
Mr. Krabs: My elders will teach your elders a little respect! Get 'em, Krabses!
Old Man Jenkins: Jenkinses, attack!
Mr. Krabs and Old Man Jenkins: Ha-ha! [both fight and slap at each other like immature children]
Ulysses S. Krabs: [getting in between the fight] Hey. Hey! Uh, you guys are kind of bumming us out.
Elizabeth Era Jenkins: Yes, we don't get to visit the land of the living very often.
Caveman Era Jenkins: And we just want to party!
Ancient Egypt Krabs: You two party-poopers need to respect your elders and vacate the premises!
[All of the ancestors kick Mr. Krabs and Old Man Jenkins out and they party inside the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Looks like it's gonna be a while.
Old Man Jenkins: What do we do now?
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and Old Man Jenkins staying at the Chum Bucket with Plankton. They are seen playing cards together, much to Plankton's discomfort.]
Plankton: Come on, guys. You've been sitting here all day! Doesn't anyone want to order some chum?
Mr. Krabs: I'll just have a small coffee, please.
Old Man Jenkins: I got this one, Krabby...[holds out half his penny] with my senior discount. Here you go, Jimbo. [flicks half the penny onto Plankton's eye]
Plankton: Ow! That's it! Both of you out!
Mr. Krabs and Old Man Jenkins: Respect your elders!


[The episode begins with Bikini Bottom news.] 
Johnny Elaine: This is a Bikini Bottom News special report. [the screen shows Perch Perkins at the Bikini Bottom power plant with the police] Perch?
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here at the Bikini Bottom power plant, where the evil supervillain known as the Dirty Bubble has finally been cornered by police!
[The Dirty Bubble is at the very top of the power plant, holding the police chief hostage.] 
Dirty Bubble: Stand back, coppers, and cease your attack, or I'll make your police chief my late night snack! [laughs and holds the chief in the air with his tongue] 
Police chief: Do what he says! [groans as the Dirty Bubble squeezes him tighter] 
Perch Perkins: [appears from the left] Will the grime of this evil soap globe wash over our fair city? Or will the law force him to clean up his act? 
Dirty Bubble: [releases the police chief and grabs Perch] Or will he choose door number three, and devour a newsman live on TV? [laughs as he goes to eat Perch] 
[Just then, three officers seize the Dirty Bubble with giant bubble wands.] 
Officer Slugfish: Drop him, airhead! 
[The officers force the Dirty Bubble to let Perch go.] 
Perch Perkins: Yipe! [falls off-screen] 
Officer Johnson: [grunts while seizing the Dirty Bubble] I got him! 
[The officers shove the Dirty Bubble into the bottle.] 
Dirty Bubble: Remember this face and remember it well, so you'll recognize me when I see you in—[gets pushed into the bottle by the chief] 
Police chief: Jail! 
[The Dirty Bubble, still in the bottle, is placed in a prison cell in Bikini Bottom Jail.] 
Johnny: Six months later... 
[Two men carry the bottle containing the dirty bubble inside. One man opens the bottle, takes out the bubble wand, dips it into the liquid and blows out the Dirty Bubble, now sparky clean and reformed.] 
Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I feel like a new bubble. [laughs] 
Warden: Remember, Bubble, keep it clean, or you'll get mean. [gives the Clean Bubble a handshake] 
Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I promise I won't let you down! [puts on his hat] 
Warden: [holds out a paper with KK on it] Here's the address of your new job. [gives the paper to the Clean Bubble and blows him away with a fan]
Clean Bubble: I'll make you proud, warden. Stay clean or you'll get mean. A new life. No more dirt, and no more wrong turns. [crashes into the Krusty Krab sign] The Krusty Krab. Hm, this must be the place! [enters the restaurant and gives a friendly handshake to Mr. Krabs] Oh, I can't thank you enough for this job, Mr. Krabs. What would you like me to do? [slams his face into the glass doors] Greet people at the door? Serve the food? 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no. I've got a special job that need someone with your special talents. You're on dirty dish detail. 
Clean Bubble: [gets real nervous when he sees a pile of dirty dishes] D-d-d-d-dirty dishes? Wait, couldn't I just work the cash register or something? 
Mr. Krabs: Listen, I hired a dish-washing bubble to save money on soap, and I want these plates sparkling by lunchtime, savvy? 
Clean Bubble: Just call me Sparkles. 
[The Clean Bubble becomes nervous and looks at the dirty dishes. One drop of slime nearly hits the Clean Bubble.] 
Clean Bubble: [sweating] Stay clean, or you'll get mean. Stay clean, or you'll get mean.
[Pans screen to the right, to reveal what appears to be a walking stack of frozen Krabby Patties coming out of the freezer.]
Clean Bubble: Ah?
[SpongeBob removes all the frozen Krabby Patties from himself and places them onto the grill]
SpongeBob: Yeah. [shivers] Brr! Is there a blizzard coming in, 'cause I've got a cold front. [laughs]
Clean Bubble: [laughs with SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi! I didn't see you there, you must be the new dishwasher. Welcome aboard! I'm SpongeBob.
Clean Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob, I'm, uh... DB, uh... DB.
SpongeBob: Oh, we're gonna have so much fun, DB. [gasps] We'll be daily pallies!
[Squidward rings the desk bell multiple times]
SpongeBob: Whoops. [grabs spatula from his hat] Back to work! [flips patties while singing to self]
Clean Bubble: [shudders] Keep it clean, or you'll get mean. [cleaning a dirty dish] Keep it clean, or you'll get mean!
[Dish is sparkling clean. Clean Bubble gasps.]
Clean Bubble: Huh. Hey, I did it! I got dirty and I didn't turn evil! Oh, I must be cured!
[Clean Bubble continuously cleans the dirty dishes with his body, while beginning to turn evil.]
Clean Bubble: Wiping up filth, wiping clean every crack! [transforms to the Dirty Bubble]
Dirty Bubble: I'm the Dirty Bubble, and, baby, I'm back! [evil laugh]
SpongeBob: Oh, what can I get you, Dirty Bubble? [Whistles while flipping a patty. Suddenly turns back surprised. Screams.]
Dirty Bubble: [evilly laughs]
SpongeBob: Dirty Bubble! Where's that nice DB? What did you do to him, you super filthy supervillain?
Dirty Bubble: [evilly laughs at SpongeBob's face]
[Dirty Bubble gets closer to SpongeBob. SpongeBob threatens to spray at him with the sink hose]
SpongeBob: What did you do with DB? [Sobs. Looks at the newly transformed Clean Bubble.]
[Clean Bubble glows and smiles]
SpongeBob: DB is short for Dirty Bubble, isn't it?
Clean Bubble: Yes, SpongeBob, it's me. I'm trying to change my evil ways and stay clean.
SpongeBob: Wow, a supervillain intervention! I'll help you, DB. I'll make sure you stay squeaky clean and dirt-free! [offers a handshake]
[Clean Bubble happily offers a handshake]
Mr. Krabs: [comes from the right with an electric fan, blowing away the Clean Bubble and SpongeBob] Attention, Mr. Bubble, I've got another job for ya!
[Transitions to Mr. Krabs and the Clean Bubble at the bathroom]
Mr. Krabs: Now, this new job is very exclusive and very French.
Clean Bubble: Hmm? Ooh-la-la! [smiles]
Mr. Krabs: [kicks open a filthy toilet] Eau de Toilette!
Clean Bubble: [gasps] Oh, sacre pee-yew! [frowns in worried disgust]
Mr. Krabs: [pointing at him] Make it sparkle! [pulls up pants, and walks off, humming]
[SpongeBob peeks out from the bathroom]
SpongeBob: Okay, he's gone. Don't worry about those toilets, DB. [grabs a toilet scrubber from his hat] I will clean them for you. Taupe sweet, mon ami. [laughs]
[Clean Bubble enthusiastically flushes the closest toilet. His eyes hallucinate.]
Clean Bubble: Dirt, dirt! Beautiful dirt! [goes into the toilet]
SpongeBob: Zut alors! [checks toilet] DB? [Peeks into toilet, and gasps as the Dirty Bubble gradually comes out. Runs off from toilet cubicle] Incoming!
Dirty Bubble: [Evil laughs. Repeatedly sings "Alouette" into each toilet, and shoves customers down the toilet.]
Fred: '[Screams while running away]
Dirty Bubble: Pow! Hold onto your certy, here comes the dirty!
[SpongeBob hoses down the Dirty Bubble with absorbed sink water. The Clean Bubble is transformed back.]
Clean Bubble: Thanks for keeping me clean, SpongeBob! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, DB. We just needed to wash away that stinkin' thinkin'!
[Transitions to a reveal a comic book named "Dirty Bubble Returns!"]
Elaine: For weeks, SpongeBob worked with DB to stay clean and good!
[Moves from a comic frame with Dirty Bubble stealing Patrick's chocolate-coated strawberry ice-cream to SpongeBob hosing down on the Dirty Bubble into the Clean Bubble with a spray bottle.]
[Dirty Bubble then appears in a comic frame where he has appeared in a laundromat, but SpongeBob grabs him and places him into the dishwasher while Old Man Jenkins still has clean washed clothes.]
[The Dirty Bubble appears yet again in another comic frame where he spits out a fountain of mud onto a bus "White Suit Society" while the fish of the bus scream and panic. SpongeBob comes in surfing and washes the Dirty Bubble down. The Clean Bubble comes on the surfboard]
[Transition to the Krusty Krab. Squidward is sleeping at the cash register area, while SpongeBob mops the floor. The Clean Bubble comes in to serve a tray of three Krabby Patties and two drinks, while whistling.]
Clean Bubble: [serves the tray to the family of customers] Enjoy those patties! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, DB, looks like you're cured. You haven't been dirty in weeks!
Clean Bubble: Thanks to you, SpongeBob, I'll never be dirty again! [laughs]
Patrick: Speaking of dirty... [Picks his belly button to reveal bellybutton gunk. Patrick stares at it menacingly, and flicks it off.] Ew.
[Bellybutton gunk lands on the Clean Bubble. The gunk spreads around him. The gunk finally cracks open to reveal the Dirty Bubble]
Dirty Bubble: [laughs evilly] You want me clean, but I ain't willing! I've gotta be me, by being a villain! [Evilly laughs. Looks left and right, then moves out to the left]
Patrick: [sheds a tear] Aww... That's nice. He found his rainbow!
SpongeBob: [surprised face] Uh-oh. [nervous face]
[At a news report of Dirty Bubble]
Elaine: The Dirty Bubble has been seen everywhere, defiling dozens of decent denizens with dirty deeds!
[Two kids play with mud. The Dirty Bubble sucks up everything in the mud pit including the mud and kids. He spits out the kids clean.]
Girl and boy: Clean? [looks at each other and cries]
[At the cabin of an abandoned ship named "The Buccaneer," surrounded by a number of landmines]
Pirate: So I said to the scalawag, "Listen here, you–" [The Dirty Bubble cleans him, transforming him into a chubby sailor.]
Chubby sailor: It's time to have tea and cakes!
Sailor #1: Get him! [everyone punches the chubby sailor]
[The Dirty Bubble comes towards a poorly maintained building. The family of three run out of the building. He cleans the entire building.]
Family of three: Yay!
[Dirty Bubble smashes building from top to bottom and laughs.]
Family of three: [disappointed] Aww.
[At the school "Poseidon Elementary"]
Old teacher: Yes, Billy, 2 plus 2 still equals 4.
[The Dirty Bubble comes and wipes out the old teacher's face]
Old teacher: [muffled] Rumpy rumpkins. [rubs face and mumbles]
Perch Perkins: Breaking news, the Dirty Bubble just wiped all the teacher's dirty looks right off their faces! Who will be next?
Dirty Bubble: [comes up to Perch Perkins and rubs off his face] No more pimples, no more bumps, no more news guy's dirty looks! [evil laugh, kisses Perkin's face to reveal an inverted face]
Perch Perkins: Hello– Urrgh, that got in my mouth!
[Dirty Bubble kicks out Perkins]
Dirty Bubble: [evil laughs, but gets hosed] Oh!
SpongeBob: Sorry, old chum, but from now on, you're gonna have to stay clean for good!
[The Dirty Bubble's grime is shown not to be wiped out]
Dirty Bubble: Be gone, hygiene. I'm too big to stay clean! [follows toward the hose while eating the water, then sucks up the entire hose and fire hydrant]
SpongeBob: [panicking sounds]
[The Dirty Bubble spits out five miniature versions of the Dirty Bubble]
SpongeBob: [more panicking sounds]
Dirty Bubble: [Evil laugh]
[Mini Dirty Bubbles bite SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [grabs spatula] It's on, now! [pops four of five miniature Dirty Bubbles with his spatula. Stomps on the final miniature Dirty Bubble]
[Dirty Bubble looks stumped. SpongeBob launches toward the Dirty Bubble, but bounces off. Dirty Bubble chases after SpongeBob.]
Dirty Bubble: [evil laughs as he chases SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [continually banging against the walls of the Dirty Bubble] Help, help, call the cops, call Mr. Krabs, call my mommy!
[Dirty Bubble looks to his right, and goes to Goo Lagoon. He rips through the sign. Shows a few kids playing in Goo Lagoon, while two unaware fish lay back on separate towels underneath an umbrella.]
Dirty Bubble: I think, for dessert, I'll eat more dirt! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: Not Goo Lagoon!
[Dirty Bubble sucks up Goo Lagoon]
SpongeBob: [grabs out paper and pencil to write quickly his last words] Thank you, my beloved pet Gary, thank you, my big pineapple, and my toolshed, and my mailbox, and Patrick! [Sobs as the dirt level increasingly gets higher and higher. Starts absorbing all the dirt.] Uh, what? Wow. Sometimes I just forget how absorbent I am. [proceeds to spin around inside like clothes in a side-loader washing machine]
Dirty Bubble: Wait, what? Ow, just... stop spinning, you sponge! You're stealing my grunge! [slowly shrinks, stammering] Stop that rhyme! [screams as he is absorbed by SpongeBob]
[SpongeBob falls into Goo Lagoon's seabed. Burps out an shrunken version of the Dirty Bubble.]
Dirty Bubble: [high pitched] I may be a squirt, but I'm still full of dirt! [evil laughs]
SpongeBob: Aww, little mini DB is so cute!
[Dirty Bubble spits dirt onto SpongeBob's eyelid. Officer Johnson catches Dirty Bubble and puts him into a jar held by lady officer]
Lady officer: We got him!
SpongeBob: Every time I wash dishes, I will think of you.
Dirty Bubble: Hmph. Every time I have nightmares, I'll think of you, too! [complaining noises]
Lady officer: Thank you, citizen. We'll take it from here.
SpongeBob: [Pretends to be the Dirty Bubble] It was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it. [evil laugh]
[Police officers gasp]
SpongeBob: Just kidding! [laughs]
[Police officers laugh with him. SpongeBob suddenly feels the urge to sneeze, splattering goo all over the place.]
Police officers: [angrily] Gesundheit!
SpongeBob: Thank you! [looks at lady officer] You got some schmutz under there. [Wipes off goo from her face. Grabs out a tissue and laughs.]
[Screen transitions to a circular black fadeout.]


[The episode begins with a big baby bottle that says "SquarePants and Star BabySitting." SpongeBob paints on the bottle and Squidward reads the bottle.]
Squidward: [reading the bottle] "SquarePants and Star Babysitting"? Oh, please. What do you two nitwits know about taking care of babies?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Just watch!
[SpongeBob and Patrick pull out powder.]
Squidward: Huh?
[SpongeBob and Patrick begin to put powder on Squidward while SpongeBob pulls supplies out of the bottle.]
SpongeBob: [pulls out a safety pin] Safety pin! [puts it in the powder cloud before pulling out a bottle of ointment] Ointment! [applies the ointment to the powder cloud] 
[SpongeBob and Patrick stop putting powder on Squidward. When the powder cloud disappears we see him wearing a baby bonnet and a diaper and holding a rattle.]
Squidward: Goo. [sadly] Goo... [cries like a baby until SpongeBob sticks a pacifier in his mouth. Squidward starts sucking on the pacifier]
SpongeBob: Aww, such a good wittle Squiddy.
[Squidward then realizes he is acting like a baby, so he jumps up and spits out the pacifier, which bounces off SpongeBob and lands in Patrick's mouth. Patrick then starts sucking on the pacifier.]
Squidward: No one in their right mind would ever hire you as babysitters!
Mother: Yoo-hoo! Babysitters! [SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward look towards the front of Conch Street where they see a woman waving to them] I could use some babysitters here!
SpongeBob: [Patrick squeals] Oh, boy!
[SpongeBob brings the baby bottle with him and runs into Squidward. Patrick hops onto the bottle before Squidward falls on his face. He then crosses his arms. SpongeBob and Patrick make it to the woman's house in front of Conch Street.]
SpongeBob:  "SquarePants and Star Babysitters" at your service!
Patrick: We sit on babies!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Not literally.
Patrick: Yeah, not in Italy.
Mother: [waves goodbye with her hat] Now you kids behave and listen to the babysitters. Bye now!
SpongeBob: Bye! [SpongeBob closes the door and sees all the babies. One baby is climbing the stair railing, another baby is chewing on a football, a baby comes out of the floorboard, a baby comes flying with a balloon until pops, and the baby falls into the floorboard, two babies are playing with the lamp, one baby is on the chair, and another baby falls in a TV.] Whoa! A whole liege of little darlings. [SpongeBob and Patrick put on helmets with rattles on them. They start shaking them.] Alright, Patrick, you take East plank, and I'll take the West, and we'll try to establish a map zone in the middle. 
Patrick: Hahahaha! These babies are no match for my... toddler style! [Patrick pulls out a pair of bottles in chains that they look like nunchucks. Patrick starts whipping the nunchuck bottles around and makes ninja sounds until he falls on his face.] Ow.
[We cut to Patrick watching the babies cry until he makes a funny face. The babies stop crying and start laughing. Patrick makes more funny faces until he stops and makes the babies cry. SpongeBob has five spoons on his head until Patrick puts another one on his head. With six spoons, Patrick lifts SpongeBob up and dips the spoons in baby food. SpongeBob feeds the babies until they stopped crying. A baby is seen on the shelf, knocking plates over. SpongeBob catches the planes, so they won't break. The baby falls off the shelf SpongeBob screams and manages to catch the baby. SpongeBob is relieved that he caught the baby, but the plates fall over the floor. The babies now are crying once again until their diapers stink. SpongeBob puts a close pin on his nose and flips them over with a giant spatula.]
SpongeBob: [whistles] Bring her down!
[Patrick uses a claw to grab the babies. SpongeBob removes the diapers with a vacuum cleaner. He puts powder on their butts until he puts new diapers on them. Patrick releases them and SpongeBob flips them on their beds while the babies fall asleep. SpongeBob puts them to bad and high fives Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Yeah. 
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shh... 
[Bubble transition to the next scene where the mother comes home. She puts her hat on the coat rack and notices SpongeBob reading a story.]
SpongeBob: And they all lived happily ever after inside an oyster shell.  
Mother: Aww... Thank you, SquarePants and Star.  
[The mother hands them money. Patrick takes it and puts it in his pocket while he is sleeping. Bubble transition to the next scene where SpongeBob and Patrick are looking for someone for babysitting.]
SpongeBob: Babysitting! 
Patrick: Skinny or chunky! Clean or funky! 
SpongeBob: We won't get paid if your kid's mislaid!
Mary: Oh, boys, right here! Oh, I could use a babysitter!
Patrick: Yay!
SpongeBob: Ooh! [They rush towards Mary] While you go out, and dance, and drevel...
Patrick: ...While we watch your little devil!
[SpongeBob and Patrick swirl her around.]
Mary: Yes! Thank you! [hugs Patrick] Thank you! [hugs SpongeBob then runs off]
SpongeBob: Wait! Where's the baby? 
Mary: She's inside! I'm free! I'm free! Hahahahaha! 
[Mary hops happily while SpongeBob and Patrick look confused at each other. But they both shrug and enters the house.]
SpongeBob: Baby! [shakes the rattle] Baby?
Patrick: [holds up a pillow] Is this the baby? 
SpongeBob: Hmm? No, I, I don't think so. 
Patrick: Huh. Oh! [holds up a lamp] This looks like a nice baby girl. [turns the lamp on] 
SpongeBob: She's nice, but she's not a baby. [Patrick throws the lamp.] Wait a minute. [SpongeBob runs to a wheelchair and looks down.] I found the baby. 
[SpongeBob turns the wheelchair around and shows Patrick the baby. But it wasn't a baby, it was Mary's mother from "Chocolate with Nuts." She is shown asleep and it startles Patrick.]
Patrick: Eek! That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen! 
SpongeBob: Patrick, all babies are beautiful. Even the ugly ones, and we don't know the baby's name is. 
Patrick: She looks like she's been in the tub too long. Let's call her Baby Prunes. 
SpongeBob: What a pretty name! Little Baby Prunes.
[They both laugh until Mary's mother wakes up and screams as she sees SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Mary's Mother: Who are you?! Where's lazy Mary?! 
Patrick: The baby can talk! 
Mary's Mother: Help! Help! It's a robbery! 
[SpongeBob puts a pacifier in her mouth.]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, Baby Prunes is just mimicking what she's heard. It's just baby talk. She's babbling. 
Mary's Mother: [spits out the pacifier] I'm not babbling, you bone heads! 
Patrick: Feeding time! [pulls out a spoon full of food] Here comes the airplane. [makes train noises and puts the food into Mary's mother's mouth, but she spits it out] Yum. Playtime! [Patrick dumps out some blocks and throws the bottle away.] Kids love to build things with blocks! 
Mary's Mother: [chuckles] Oh, I'll build something alright.
[We cut a bubble transition to all the blocks built into a jail with SpongeBob and Patrick in it. SpongeBob writes on the wall. Inside the play jail, there is a toilet, a pipe, a bunch, and a shelf filled with books. SpongeBob checks his watch.]
Mary's Mother: Put me down you yellow scouring pad! Unhand me! [cuts to SpongeBob walking to a spot in Mary's house and Patrick pulls out a baby cradle.] No! [SpongeBob puts Mary's Mother in the cradle.] Get me out of here! [SpongeBob puts on a baby hat Mary's Mother tucks her in a blanket and staples it to the cradle.] Ow! Ugh! Ouch! [Screams.} 
SpongeBob: Oooo! Who's a colicky baby? It's you! [SpongeBob tickles Mary's Mother in the neck with one finger.] Coochy coochy coo!  
Mary's Mother: Bleh. 
SpongeBob: I'll go up and prepare a bath for Baby Prunes for when she wakes up. 
Patrick: Okay. While you're doing that I'll just space out. Uhhh...
[As SpongeBob goes upstairs, Patrick's eyes turn upwards and drools. Mary's Mother looks at Patrick with his eyes upwards, and then escapes from the cradle by using a secret door at the bottom of the cradle, and runs away chuckling evilly. Meanwhile, at upstairs SpongeBob is at Mary's bathroom. SpongeBob turns on a faucet on a bathtub.]
SpongeBob: Strange... There don't seem to be any baby items in here. Hmm... [looks in a cabinet to find not baby items but old woman stuff.] Okay, pills, pills, dentures, more pills, hemorrhoid cream. [SpongeBob closes the cabinet but then notices a little birthday note stuck on the bottom left corner of the cabinet.] "Happy birthday to mother on her 137th birthday." Aw. [gasps and realizes the truth] 137th birthday?! Ohhhh! Baby Prunes isn't a baby, she's an old lady! 
[Meanwhile, Mary's mother is trying to escape from Mary's house using her tongue to unlock the door]
Mary's Mother: Come on, come on! [Just then Patrick comes along with his eyes still upwards]  
Patrick: Is that a puppy I hear? I didn't know they had a puppy. What is it puppy? You wanna go out? [Mary's Mother frees her tongue out, a light bulb appears on top of her head]   
Mary's Mother: Oh. [barking]
Patrick: There you go puppy.
Mary's Mother: So long sucker! [maniacal laughing] Uh... [barking]  
Patrick: Huh, the puppy knows baby talk too... [Just then SpongeBob comes in from the stairs]
SpongeBob: Patrick! She's not a baby! [SpongeBob falls from down the stairs and hits Patrick and looks around while he's on Patrick's stomach.] Where's Baby Prunes? 
Patrick: I dunno, I just let the puppy out. 
SpongeBob: That was no puppy! [SpongeBob is jumping on Patrick's stomach] That was an old lady! An old lady that we're responsible for! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run outside to find Mary's Mother] 
SpongeBob: If you were an old lady where would you go?! 
Patrick: Ah, I don't know back in time?! 
SpongeBob: What about a sewing circle?
Patrick: Ah, yes a sewing circle back in time.
SpongeBob: Come on! [SpongeBob and Patrick go into a sewing circle with some old ladies] 
SpongeBob: Old lady Prunes? [The old ladies look at SpongeBob and Patrick in wonder] Have you seen a baby that's really an old lady? 
Bakery Cashier: Oh, look they have shmoods on their faces. [she spit on a napkin which then the other ladies follow]
SpongeBob: No, not that. [Patrick and SpongeBob are scared while the old ladies rub the napkin on their bodies]
SpongeBob: Ah, where's baby/old lady Prunes?
Patrick: No, no gross. [Patrick is disgusted while the old ladies rub them.]
French Narrator: Meanwhile... [cuts to a scene into a lava surf place.] 
Surfers: Yeah!
Mary's Mother: Yee-Haw! Lavabunga! [While Mary's Mother is having fun the other surfers on gone and loses the challenge, then she laughs maniacally then we cut to a scene where their parachuting]  
Skydiver: What are you doing you don't have a parachute?
Mary's Mother: Parachutes are for babies. [then she jumps and laughs maniacally while the skydiver is surprised] Oh yeah! [she falls into a haystack]
SpongeBob: Prunes!
Patrick: Old lady Prunes! 
SpongeBob: Old lady baby Prunes! [Mary's Mother is wrestling and throws and boxer on SpongeBob and Patrick] 
Mary's Mother: Well, if it isn't my two babysitters! you humiliated me!  
SpongeBob: Prunes, you're alive!
Patrick: And still talking baby talk! [They run to her and she mumbles angrily]
Mary's Mother: Why! [she then punches them in the face] 
SpongeBob: Ahh, Pruny wants to play nice old lady [then she repeatedly hits them until they become realistic]
Patrick: Ah, boxing tired her out. [then they fall out of the tree]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shh... 
SpongeBob: Ah, another job well done. [sniffs] Uh, Patrick, I think she needs to be changed.
Patrick: No, that's me. [The episode ends by them walking toward the sun set.]


Original Version
[The episode starts with Patchy the Pirate struggling to start his boat on someone's driveway.]
Patchy: Oh, hi, kids! Patchy Pirate here on a glorious day. I'm going to deliver this here very special present to SpongeBob on his birthday. That is, if I can get this blasted boat to start. [turns the ignition with his key] And start! [chuckles]
[Patchy's boat wouldn't start and Potty comes out of the trunk.]
Potty: Maybe if you remembered to fill the tank with gas...
Patchy: Oh, Potty, you're full of gas! Get outta here!
Potty: [flies onto the hood] I see the problem! [bangs on the hood with the hammer]
[The hood sent Patchy flying backwards and smashing into the garage door via airbag.]
Patchy: [groaning] Walking is better than driving anyway. I've been meaning to work on me land legs. [pulls up his pants and reveals his wavy legs]
Potty: Squawk, squawk!
Patchy: [takes the present from the trunk and happily laughs] Now to see which way the wind is blowing. [sticks his finger in his mouth, holds out his hand with a sail on it, and then the wind blows the other direction] This way! [the wind blows Patchy down the street] Whoa!
Potty: [follows Patchy while squawking] Hard to port!
[Meanwhile, at the brink of dawn, SpongeBob is sleeping in his bed. Gary is holding a birthday present for SpongeBob while sleeping. Moments later, the alarm clock goes off.]
SpongeBob's alarm clock: Wake up!
Gary: [meows in the tune of the "Happy Birthday" song]
SpongeBob: What? Today? My birthday? Oh, Gary, you know I never pay attention to those sorts of things.
[SpongeBob hops out of his bed and streamers and confetti fly out. He blows the noise maker a couple times and laughs. He opens Gary's present, which reveals to be a jellyfish net made out of slime.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, wow, Gary! Did you make me this jellyfishing net yourself?
Gary: [gives SpongeBob a thumb's up with his slime] Meow!
[SpongeBob swings the slime jellyfish net around, but splashes slime all over his bedroom. Some slime flew out his window and landed in Squidward's coffee as he's getting the newspaper. Squidward sips some of his coffee, unaware of the slime being in it. SpongeBob swings the net until it is gone.]
SpongeBob: Best present ever! [hugs Gary and laughs]
[Gary happily licks SpongeBob. The scene scrolls over to Patrick's house, where everyone is planning a surprise party for SpongeBob. However, due to Patrick's idiocy and lack of concentration, everyone appears to be tired.]
Sandy: Aw, come on, Patrick. We've been up all night. For the one millionth time, [flips the board while she's explaining her plan] you're going to get SpongeBob out of his house with a sight-seeing tour so we can go in and decorate it for his surprise party. [leans in closer to Patrick's face] Okay?! Repeat it back to me.
Patrick: Gotcha. I'm gonna collect all the pretty eggs that I can see and repeat it back to me.
[Everyone groans angrily at Patrick's stupidity. Sandy facepalms in disgust just as she's about to give up. Suddenly, Patrick's alarm clock on his wrist rings.]
Patrick: Hmm? [looks at his clock] Oh, would you look at the hour? It's almost time for me to take SpongeBob on that tour so you guys can decorate his house.
Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Old Man Walker, Bubble Bass, and Plankton: [surprised and confused] Huh?
Plankton: Huh. I guess even a broken moron can be right once a day. [hops into Patrick's pocket]
Patrick: Hey, what's the big idea?
Plankton: [pops out of Patrick's pocket] It's part of the plan, idiot! I jump from your shorts into SpongeBob's pocket to get his keys? Remember? [goes back in the pocket]
Patrick: Okay, well, don't mess with my stuff in there. [the scene changes to Patrick walking to SpongeBob's house while tapping his head] Get SpongeBob on the bus. Get SpongeBob on the bus. Get SpongeBob on the bus. [knocks on SpongeBob's front door]
SpongeBob: [answers the door] Hi, buddy.
Patrick: Uh...[drools a river of saliva]
[SpongeBob giggles happily and Patrick makes a creepy face while drooling. SpongeBob blows his noise maker and Patrick makes a even creepier face while drooling. Patrick drools out a saliva bubble from his mouth. The saliva bubble floats over to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] You remembered my birthday! [ties a string on the saliva bubble to make a balloon before it pops in his face]
[Patrick makes an uglier face while continuously drooling a river of saliva. Just then, a fish tank bus pulls over to SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: Oh, and you got me a sight-seeing bus tour as a present!
[Patrick turns around while drooling a river of saliva.]
Patrick: [wakes up from his stupidity] Huh? Oh, oh! And—and there's a secret I'm not supposed to tell you, which is...[strains himself until his eyes pop out and fire ignites in his skull; SpongeBob gives Patrick a glass of water to put out the fire and the eyeballs grow back; Patrick starts acting stupid again] Nope. I lost everything in the fire. Who are you? Who am I? Where are we?
SpongeBob: I have an idea, pal. How would you like to take a little sight-seeing tour with me?
Patrick: Wow. Thank you, kind stranger.
[SpongeBob closes the door and locks it with his keys. Plankton peaks out from Patrick's pocket and crawls to the other pocket. Plankton hops into SpongeBob's pants to get the keys and comes back out with them. SpongeBob and Patrick board the tour bus and drives away.]
Plankton: Hmm? [sees a mint on his back; he groans in disgust and pulls it off] Ow! [throws the mint away and chuckles] I've got his house key! [notices the Krusty Krab key] Hey! This is the key to the Krusty Krab! [giggles] The secret formula is— [gets stepped on by Mr. Krabs] Ow!
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles and grabs the keys] Nice work, Plankton, and nice try. [unlocks the door and lets Sandy, Bubble Bass, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff in; he then stops Old Man Walker] Hold on there, old timer. [carries him to the curb] We're gonna need you as a lookout.
Old Man Walker: What? Cook out?
Mr. Krabs: When you see SpongeBob approaching, give a holler. Can ya holler?
[Old Man Walker tries to holler, but it isn't loud enough.]
Mr. Krabs: Eh, not bad. [slaps Old Man Walker, but knocks his glasses off] You just keep practicing that, tiger. [heads into SpongeBob's house]
Old Man Walker: Huh? Tiger? There's a tiger? [waves his walker] Oh! [heads to sleep]
Sandy: [carries SpongeBob's TV out of the house] Come on! We need to make room inside for the party.
Plankton: [carries SpongeBob's armchair while Mr. Krabs sits on it; Plankton strains in pain] I could use a little help here!
Mr. Krabs: [holding a plant while sitting on the armchair] Sorry, my claws are full.
Bubble Bass: [carries SpongeBob's sofa and hook out with Mrs. Puff; Bubble Bass groans] Where do we put all this junk?
Sandy: Follow me. Just a little further.
[Meanwhile, Squidward is coming back from his early morning walk.]
Squidward: [humming to the music from his headphones before looking in the mirror] Ah, I sure worked up that sweat. [a tiny drop is shown on Squidward's nose; he opens the door and all of SpongeBob's stuff fall on him] What is SpongeBob's awful furniture doing in my house?
Sandy: [lassos Squidward by the nose and pulls him to SpongeBob's house] We're gussying up SpongeBob's house for his party, and something about you tells me you are quite the interior decorator.
Squidward: Hmm? [unties the rope off his nose] Of course! I didn't give myself all those awards for nothing!
[The scene cuts to all of the decorating trophies Squidward won for himself.]
Sandy: Yee-haw! SpongeBob's place is gonna look prettier than a country bride!
[The scene shows a cow waiting for her groom at a wedding in Texas. The scene then changes to the bus tour SpongeBob and Patrick are having.]
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! Oh, this is so exciting! I wonder where we're going?
Rube: We're going to Surface Land! [pulls the lever and shows the sign on the bus saying, "Surface Land"]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: [exclaiming in amazement]
SpongeBob: Surface Land? [screams happily]
Patrick: [screams in fear]
Rube: [turns around to speak to the tourists] Hi, everybody, and welcome to Surface Land Tours! I'm your tour guide, Rube.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Hi, Rube!
Rube: Before we drive to the amazing Surface Land, I'm required to read you these tour bus rules. [takes out a long list of rules from his hat and reads] "Please sit in an upright position." [SpongeBob and Patrick sit upside down and gets into an upright position] "Absolutely no bad language!" [SpongeBob and Patrick say bad words as dolphin chirps are heard; they stop talking and cover their mouths] "No horseplay!" [SpongeBob and Patrick dance around in a horse suit and stop to sit back down] And no digging, no dancing, no tanning, no cooking, no fencing, no drowning, no molting, no running, no trespassing, no peeking, and no balloons!" [pops SpongeBob and Patrick with a needle when they appeared as balloons]
SpongeBob: Aww. Not even birthday balloons?
Rube: [gasps] Oh, my goodness! Is it your birthday?
SpongeBob: [his cheeks blow up and pop] Yes! [giggles]
Rube: Well, I would love for everyone to sing happy birthday to you! [puts a party hat on SpongeBob]
Tourist #1: Yes!
SpongeBob: Aww, really? That is so —
Rube: Not now, of course. Tour time is tight! [hops back into his driving seat] Whoa! [drives the bus back onto the road; then drives up a steep cliff, which makes every fall over] Okay, everybody, we're on Upseedaisy Street, and ready for lift off!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Lift off?
[Rube drives the bus upward to the sign that says "Dead End." SpongeBob and Patrick breath heavily in paper bags. The bus rockets up to the surface.]
Rube: Amazing!
SpongeBob: Oh, are we there yet?
Rube: Almost. But we need a little boast to the surface. [honks his horn]
[The bus descends downward until a submarine catches them.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
French Narrator: One Little Boast to the Surface Later... [throws away the time card and drives the submarine up to the surface]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh!
SpongeBob: Look, it's Sandy's friend, Frenchy! Oui, oui!
Rube: You can say that again, birthday boy. Oui, oui!
Patrick: [dances around while holding his pants] Can you guys please stop saying "wee wee?" [strains] Gotta go! Gotta go!
[Up on the surface, David Hasselhoff is kayaking on the water when the submarine knocks him over.]
Rube: Wave goodbye to Frenchy, everybody!
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Goodbye, Frenchy!
French Narrator: Au revoir, my friends! [goes back into his submarine]
[Rube drives the bus off the submarine before it descends back into the ocean.]
David Hasselhoff: [groans] Ah! Tartar sauce!
[Rube drives the bus out of the ocean and heads over to the beach.]
Rube: Now remember, everyone, keep your arms and legs inside the bus at all times 'cause we are about to encounter a gaggle of nearly naked beach giraffes!
[Rube drives the bus around the beach. They drive by a local fisherman in a raincoat.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh! [snaps photos with their cameras]
[The fisherman catches what he assumed is a fish, but it turns out that he hooked his own boot. Rube drives by the fisherman as the tour goes on. He then drives the bus past some party goers who are having a beach party. Everyone was dancing with the beat and are having quite a blast. Rube then drives over a sleeping man who is sunbathing. SpongeBob and Patrick are deeply amazed at what they are seeing. SpongeBob screams loudly.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nearly naked beach giraffes!
[The beach goers continue to dance. SpongeBob and Patrick hover onto Rube in deep fear.]
Rube: Don't worry, everyone. The beach giraffes may look crazy, but they're actually peaceful creatures. Let's get a closer look.
[Rube drives the bus through the crowd without getting themselves stepped on. SpongeBob and Patrick continuously scream as Rube drives. Rube stops the bus in front of the stage. A man in a "Can-O Beans" costume appears on the stage.]
Can: Hey, kids, welcome to Beach Blanket Bean-go! [everyone cheers; opens his lid] And here's your host, Beanie McBeans!
Beanie McBeans: [pops out of the can and the crowd cheers wildly] Hey! What do you want?
Beach Goers: Beans!
Beanie McBeans: When do you want them?
Beach Goers: Beans!
Beanie McBeans: Ha, ha!
Beach Goers: Beans, beans, beans...!
Beanie McBeans: [cheers] Beans, beans, good for your heart! They make you strong, they make you smart! When I eat beans, I squeal! I eat beans with every meal! You do, too! You know you do! [everyone cheers] Beans, beans! [throws beans at everyone] Beans, beans, beans! [throws more beans at everyone and dances around]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
Patrick: Oh, he's good.
Beanie McBeans: [to his first contestant] All right, you know the rules. First question: How many beans are in a 16 ounce can?
Contestant #1: Uh? Three million?
Beanie McBeans: Sorry! Wrong answer! [shoots bean slime from his cannon at his contestant]
[The audience gasps.]
Contestant #1: [short silence] Yeah!
[The audience cheers.]
Beanie McBeans: Better luck next time! And now it's time for our next contestant.
Contestant #2: [giggles] Hi!
Beanie McBeans: What is your favorite kind of bean?
Contestant #2: Um... strawberry beans?
Beanie McBeans: Is the correct answer! [shoots bean slime from his cannon at his contestant]
Contestant #2: Ooh! Yay!
[The audience cheers. Patrick starts to take a liking to beans and his mouth waters.]
Patrick: So many beans! [presses his face against the glass and whimpers]
SpongeBob: Uh-oh.
[Patrick could not resist and rushes over to the driver's seat.]
Rube: [gets pushed aside by Patrick] Whoa!
Patrick: Must have beans! [begins to drive wildly like a mad animal]
SpongeBob, Rube, and the tourists: Whoa! Uh-oh!
Patrick: Beans, beans, beans, beans, beans!
Beach Goers: Whoa! [feels Patrick running over their toes]
Rube: Stop! [screams]
[Patrick drives through the audience, skids over a man's back and flies over to the stage's microphone.]
Patrick: [jumps out of the bus] Wrong answer! [falls back in]
[Beanie McBeans fires bean slime from his cannon at the bus, which completely fills up with beans. Patrick goggles up all of the beans, but in doing so, drinks all of the water as well. Soon, everyone on the bus is drying up because of Patrick's arrogant actions. After eating the beans, Patrick sits down and is all dried up.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! You ate all the water!
Patrick: It's not my fault. The water got in the way!
Rube: Passengers, do not panic! We can get water right over there. [points to a beach shower and drives off the stage]
[Several beach goers are standing in line to clean the sand off. One man does some reflexes while cleaning himself. Then he picks up his beach toys and skips away. Then a woman takes a turn, only to clean the sand off her kickboard. SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the other tourists wait patiently in line.]
Female Beach Goer: [finishes cleaning the sand off her kickboard] Okay. Perfect! [picks up her towel and leaves]
[Then a tall man gets a turn at the beach shower. He cleans himself for a bit and leaves. Then it was SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the other tourists' turn. The shower fills the bus with water and everyone can breathe again.]
Rube: Ah! And we're back!
SpongeBob: Yeesh, I thought this was my birthday, not my deathday! [laughs as Patrick makes a scared look on his face] I'm sorry, Patrick. I was just kidding.
[Patrick screams as a big, white, fluffy dog approaches. Everyone on the bus panics upon seeing the dog for the first time.]
SpongeBob: Oh! What am I looking at?!
Rube: You're looking at an amazing creature that is just as afraid as you are of it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [peeking out from SpongeBob's pants] I doubt it!
Rube: I'm telling ya, that is a blue feathered northwestern pie-dragon. So calm down, guys. It only eats pies. [sees the dog drinking the water from the bus] I was wrong! It's gonna eat us! Run!
[Everyone panics and Rube drives the bus to get as far away from the dog as he can.]
Dog Walker: [gets pulled by the dog] Whoa!
[Meanwhile, back at SpongeBob's house, Old Man Walker continues sleeping. But inside, things are going out of hand when everyone is making constant arguments about decorating the house. Sandy is not overly thrilled with their childish behavior because everyone is acting like spoiled and immature children.]
Mr. Krabs: I should be decorating! No one here knows diddly about SpongeBob! [continuously yells at everyone]
Squidward: I know more about SpongeBob than I care to! So I should decorate.
Mrs. Puff: [holds up a broken steering wheel] Have you ever taught him to drive?!
Plankton: [holds up a ray gun] Have you ever tried to annihilate him?!
[Everyone continues to bicker.]
Sandy: Now hold your horses! Seems like everyone has their own ideas about how to decorate for SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Mrs. Puff, Plankton, and Bubble Bass: [stop fighting] Surprise!
Sandy: Not now!
Mr. Krabs: Well, since SpongeBob works for me, I know he'd like [holds up Krabby Patty decorations] a Krusty Krab theme!
Plankton: Working for you means he's a masochist. So, a torture theme is the way to go. [squeezes his head with a squeeze wrench, but his eye pops out in the process] Ow!
[The doorbell rings and Squidward answers it. Mrs. Puff comes in with a boatmobile.]
Mrs. Puff: A driving theme is what SpongeBob would love. [opens the hood and reveals party food inside]
Squidward: [takes a chip and sniffs it] Hmm. Unleaded. [throws the chip away]
Bubble Bass: [leans in closer to Squidward's face] You're all lame! The theme has got to be Mermaid Man or nada. [dresses himself up as Mermaid Man, but loses the scallop bra and his pants rip, revealing Dirty Bubble underwear]
Squidward: [removes the scallop bra from his face and holds up a picture of himself and his clarinet] I'm obviously his idol. A theme based on me is the only —
Sandy: Everybody hog-tie your lips and listen up! [stomps the floor really hard and sends Plankton flying upward before coming back down] Since we all know what SpongeBob likes best, how about each of us gets to decorate one section of the house? [sighs angrily and divides the living room into different sections with a red chalk]
Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Mrs. Puff, Plankton, and Bubble Bass: [calm down] Oh!
[Sandy draws onto Gary's shell while dividing the house. Gary wakes up and sees his shell drawn from the chalk. Gary meows in annoyance and slithers away, leaving a gap in the middle of the floor. The scene changes to Squidward decorating one section of the house with his paintings and Sandy decorates one section with things based on karate.]
Sandy: Hiya! [kicks the punching bag, which knocks Squidward over] Oh. Sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: [mumbles] Hmm. Sorry, Squidward...[slips on a puddle of black paint and bumps into Bubble Bass, ruining his Mermaid Man themed birthday cake]
Bubble Bass: [growls] Behold my super pit power! [grabs Squidward and places him under his armpit]
Squidward: No, no, no!
[Squidward gives into the armpit's stench and melts into a puddle. He slithers over to Mrs. Puff's boating themed section.]
Mrs. Puff: Ew! [pushes Squidward out with her stop sign] Will you kindly keep your Squidward puddle on your side of the line?!
Mr. Krabs: Ha! You tell him, sweetheart. [gently pats Mrs. Puff's back, but she puffs up] Whoa! [crashes on a Krusty Krab table] That hurt-erer.
Plankton: [laughs] Oh, yeah, looks like the Party Wars are just beginning. [eats some popcorn and laughs]
[Plankton jumps on the spike chair and gets pricked. Plankton screams in pain and flies onto Sandy's helmet.]
Sandy: Eew! [wipes Plankton off her helmet]
[Plankton flies onto Mr. Krabs' right eyestalk, which falls off. Mr. Krabs growls in anger, picks up his eyestalk and flings Plankton into a plate of gelatin.]
Mr. Krabs: [growls] You did that on purpose.
Sandy: Aw! Tell it to your Aunt Chovy!
Old Man Walker: [comes in between Sandy and Mr. Krabs] Well, I need to use the little boy's room.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, yes! What I need is you! [picks up Old Man Walker]
Old Man Walker: Oh, just — wait a minute, lady!
Mrs. Puff: [sets Old Man Walker down] Now my "Pedestrians Have The Right Of Way" display is perfect!
Old Man Walker: Is this the restroom?
Bubble Bass: Why do you get to use this elder? I saw him first! You'll make a great Mermaid Man. [puts a purple starfish on Old Man Walker's face and lifts him up]
Old Man Walker: There's only one thing I want to make.
[Meanwhile, back on the surface world, Rube drives the bus on a tree branch in the middle of a local park.]
Rube: Aren't these leafy things amazing?
SpongeBob: Ooh! My friend Sandy has one of these. They call them trees.
SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists: [fall off the tree] Whoa! [lands on the ground]
Rube: [resumes driving] I didn't know that. Wow! Look at the big brain on the birthday boy! [drives into a log]
Patrick: Nobody looks at my friend's brain without permission!
SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists: [the animals scatter out of the log] Whoa!
[Rube drives pass the same dog who is playing fetch with its owner.]
Dog Walker: Oh, who's a good dog? [throws a frisbee] Go get it! Go get it! Go get it, girl! Get it! Yeah! [laughs as the dog fetches the frisbee and brings it back]  Good girl!
SpongeBob: What a birthday! Beach giraffes, pie-dragons, and beans! Oh, I can't wait to see what happens next!
[The frisbee hits the bus and Rube stops driving.]
Rube: Oh, my! It's a flying pie!
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh! [giggles]
[The dog comes running towards them.]
Patrick: And here comes the pie-dragon!
[Everyone on the bus screams in horror. But the dog picks up the frisbee and heads back to her owner. Everyone on the bus sighs in relief.]
Rube: That sure was a close one, eh, folks? Amazing!
Dog Walker: [throws the frisbee] Whoa! [laughs]
[The dog comes running back.]
SpongeBob: [yells] It's coming back!
[Rube turns the bus around and drives away from the dog. But the dog pursues them in fast speed.]
Rube: We're not pie! Why is it chasing us?! Why? Why?
[SpongeBob looks and sees Patrick is not in his seat. He looks around until he finds Patrick sticking his head out of the water while holding a frisbee in his mouth. SpongeBob comes up and grabs the frisbee.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, let go of that pie! [pulls the frisbee out of Patrick's mouth and Patrick growls angrily like a real dog] Bad Patrick, bad! [throws the frisbee away] Yah!
[The dog runs off to retrieve the frisbee and everyone is saved.]
Patrick: Aww, I wanted flying pie.
SpongeBob: [giggles as he forgivingly rubs Patrick's head] Take this instead [holds up a whoopie cushion]
[SpongeBob gives Patrick the whoopie cushion and the both go back into the bus. Rube continues to drive the bus down the park.]
Rube: Okay. We'll stay on the path, where it's not so dangerous. And I think that this is the perfect time to sing "Happy Birthday" to our little square friend here! [pulls SpongeBob from his seat and blows his kazoo]
Patrick, Rube, and the tourists: ♪ Happy birthday — ♪
Charlie: Look out!
[All of a sudden, Patchy and Potty come out of nowhere in a recumbent bicycle. Everyone on the bus screams in horror and skids the bus out of harm's way.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Road hog!
[Patchy and Potty continue pedaling down the path. Meanwhile, back at SpongeBob's house, everyone is lined up for the party.]
Party Guests: Oh, boy. Oh, man, I am starving. I haven't been to a party in 20 years.
[Larry comes by with a present.]
Larry: Yo, dude. [taps a creepy man's shoulder] Is this the line for SpongeBob's party?
Slappy: Oh, yes. Mmm... [turns around and shows an empty plate] I brought the birthday cake.
Larry: It's gone.
Slappy: Oh, no, it's still here. [points to his stomach and giggles creepily]
Larry: [a bit creeped out] Do me a favor, Slappy. When we're inside, stay away from me. [pushes the creepy man away]
[Back inside, everyone is getting themselves comfortable.]
Party Guests: Say, what a party! [instant chattering] They really dressed up the place. Yeah, there it is. Smells great.
Margaret SquarePants: Our boy sure has a lot of interesting friends. What kind of party food is that, dear?
Harold SquarePants: Uh, aquarium fish flakes.
Margaret SquarePants: Well, now it is a party!
[Harold opens the lid and shakes some fish flakes above. Harold and Margaret feed on the flakes.]
Mr. Krabs: Step right up to enter the Krusty Krab section of this party.
Old Man Walker: [comes in] What do I do to get in?
Mr. Krabs: Just consent to a pat down, old timer.
Old Man Walker: Oh, boy. Okay. [turns around]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles greedily and steals money from Old Man Walker's wallet] Ooh! [puts the money in his pocket] Okay, you're good. [lets Old Man Walker in the Krusty Krab section]
Squidward: [tastes some of Bubble Bass's Mermaid Man themed birthday cake] Hmm. Lowbrow compared to highbrow. Say, aren't you a little old for this weenie wizard stuff?
Bubble Bass: [picks up a Man Ray action figure] I am casting a vanishing spell upon you. Begone!
Squidward: Begone! [chuckles but chokes on the cake] Water! [runs off]
Bubble Bass: Huh? Ooh! I have powers!
[Mrs. Puff comes by with a boating themed birthday cake for her section of the party. Just as she is about to put it down, the party guests rudely take her cake.]
Harold and Grubby Grouper: Ooh! Cake! [eat the cake]
Sandy: Please, everybody, don't eat the party food! [hits Harold and Grubby Grouper's heads and makes them cough up the now eaten cake; she rushes over and stops the football player from eating the chips, drinks and gelatin] We have to wait for SpongeBob! It's supposed to be a surprise!
Party Guests: Surprise!
Sandy: Not now!
Party Guests: Aww!
Evelyn Annette: [knocks over a lamp by accident] Sorry.
Sandy: [sets the lamp back up] Please be careful.
[Norma ignores Sandy's orders and knocks over the lamp again. The creepy man sits on the table where the party food are.]
Sandy: Hey, hey, hey! Don't sit on that table!
Slappy: Oh, I'm just having fun, and I brought cake. [eats the entire cake]
[The creepy man becomes so fat from eating the cake that he splits the table in half. He coughs up the cake. Sandy groans in disgust. Two kids come by and start eating the partially eaten cake, much to Sandy's disgust. The kids burp out a slob of the icing and stain Sandy's fluffy tail.]
Sandy: Aww! I just had my tail done! This makes me hotter than a billy goat in a pepper patch! [karate chops the table along with the partially eaten cake] Hiya! [breathes heavily and yells]
Slappy: Surprise.
Sandy: Not yet. [punches the creepy man and stomps over to another section of the party]
[The hat kid appears from under the table and slingshots a rock on Tom's buttocks.]
Tom: Hey! [the hat kid chuckles and Tom takes one of Squidward's paintings] How much for this one?
Squidward: Oh, no. That's a present for SpongeBob—ten bucks.
Tom: Here's some fun back at ya! [throws the painting, but the hat kid dodges] I love your work. [holds out money] Have you got anything heavier?
[Plankton is wearing a dark lord robe and grins evilly before pulling back his hood. He does his normal evil laughter as Sandals and Fred are being strapped in torture devices.]
Sandals: Ow, man. What the heck?
Plankton: It's a theme party. Get into it. Say it, Fred. [turns the dial to pull Fred's leg]
Fred: No.
Plankton: Say it! [turns the dial tighter]
Fred: [groans] My leg.
Grubby Grouper: [paints a target on the wall in Mrs. Puff's boating section] Party games!
[The football player bashes against the wall and everyone cheers.]
Sandy: Hey! Don't do that!
[Suddenly, the wall cracks and one section of SpongeBob's house is destroyed. Everyone gasps.]
Sandy: Uh-oh. I hope someone brings a wall as a present. [another wall cracks and falls over, destroying another section of SpongeBob's house] Make that two walls.
[The party guests didn't seem to care about the destruction they've caused and cheered. The hat kid sprayed whipped cream on the floor and runs off. Mrs. Puff comes by and slips on the whipped cream.]
Mrs. Puff: [slips on the whipped cream] Whoa, whoa, whoa! [spins around until Sandy catches her]
[The party guests cheer, thinking they were dancing.]
Sandy: Great idea, Puff! Some positive energy! Hey, everybody! [puts a record on the phonograph and plays music] Dance party! [puts on her cowboy hat] Yee-haw! [dances by Squidward and Bubble Bass] Come on, boys. Move those feet! Do-si-do!
[Squidward and Bubble Bass shrug their shoulders and reluctantly join in the fun. Sandals and Fred dance as well, despite being strapped to torture devices. Mr. Krabs dances with Pearl and some of her school friends. Karen dances with Plankton, but gets stepped on by several of the party guests. Karen gasps and moves Plankton over to a more safer area of SpongeBob's house.]
Sandy: SpongeBob better come home soon. I don't know how long I can keep these folks dancing. [Larry comes in and grabs Sandy so he can dance with her] Oh, you took me by surprise.
Party Guests: Surprise!
Sandy: Not now!
[Meanwhile, back on the surface world, Rube is driving the bus over some high wires in a suburban area.]
SpongeBob: Wow! In Surface Land, everywhere you go is full of surprises!
Patrick: Yeah, I'm surprised we haven't crashed yet.
[Rube drives the bus through the airport as one airplane begins to take off.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Wow!
[Rube drives through the conveyer belt at a hardware store.]
Rube: As you can see, Surface Land is full of unexplained wonders!
[Rube drives over the roof of a moving red car. The car stops and Rube drives the bus over to what appears to be an office building. One employee enters through the spinning door. Rube drives the bus, but the spinning door spins them around.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Whoa! [gets flung out of the spinning door and skids down the hallway]
SpongeBob: Best birthday ride ever! [the bus drives by some office desks] I've read about this place, Patrick. It's the Paperclip Jungle!
[Patrick looks around and sees officer employees minding their our business while doing paperwork. Patrick becomes frightened at everything he sees. One man drops a box of paperclips. Patrick screams and hides behind SpongeBob with a paperclip stuck on his head.]
Patrick: They're everywhere.
[Rube drives by some officer employees near a copy machine.]
Female Office Employee #1: Just let me copy it! [kicks the copy machine and paper flies out everywhere]
[Rube drives the bus into a conference room where some of the employees are having a private conversation with their job.]
Female Office Employee #2: My fault? How is it my fault?
SpongeBob: Ooh, what happens in here?
Patrick: Smells like flop sweat!
Rube: Shh! This is the secret hive of the Double-breasted Seer Suckers. Let's watch their strange rituals!
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh!
Female Office Employee #3: [comes in the conference room] He's coming!
[The office employees gasp and quickly put on their gorilla masks.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists: Huh?
[One man in a gorilla mask, who is the boss, jumps in and pounds on his chest while making grunting noises like a real gorilla. The gorilla mask boss walks over to the front and pulls down a chart. He grunts to his employees that profits are decreasing dramatically and they all began to act crazy, wrecking everything in sight. The man with the dog comes in and joins in the chaos as well. The dog jumps onto the table and barks.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: The pie dragon!
Rube: This bunch of bananas is getting too crazy to comfort. We'd better split! [hops back into his driving seat]
[Rube backs the bus up against the fire alarm, which triggers the sprinkler system. Rube drives the bus out of the conference room just as the boss, the dog, the dog's owner, and employees get soaked. Two employees took notice of the commotion, but ignored it and continued to do their job.]
PA System: [voiceover] Lunch time!
Boss, the Dog, the Dog Walker, and Office Employees: [stop] Huh?
[The officer employees and their boss remove their masks and head out of the conference room in a very fast speed, nearly bumping into Rube's bus.]
Rube: Crash positions, everybody!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [jump off their seat and crash into the windshield] Crash positions! Check!
[The dog barks and stands on her hind legs before walking out. The officer employees and their boss all head for the spinning door. Rube follows the group and manages to drive the bus out of the building through the spinning door. Rube drives the bus over to a local fast food restaurant called the Trusty Slab, which is the reenactment version of the Krusty Krab back in Bikini Bottom. The office employees line up and enter the restaurant.]
SpongeBob: The Trusty Slab? Sounds familiar.
[Rube follows the office employees and enters the restaurant through the front door.]
Rube: Whew! Sorry for the detour, folks. Now back to de-tour.
[The chef flips a patty and rings the bell. Patrick's mouth begins to water at the sights of food in the Trusty Slab.]
Patrick: Ooh! [grabs a ketchup packet] They grow 'em big up here, SpongeBob! Oh, come here. [hugs the packet really tight and explodes ketchup everywhere; he laughs and licks the himself clean; he sees a spot on SpongeBob's nose and licks it too, which makes SpongeBob laugh]
Rube: Let's watch these hungry beach giraffes as they struggle to communicate.
[As they watch, a man, who appears to be a reenactment of Patrick Star, is at the cash register, struggling to decide what to eat. The cashier, who appears to be a reenactment of Squidward, is waiting impatiently.]
Patrick (live-action): No, no, wait! Uh, I'll have the, uh...
Mr. Manward: Sir, could you please order something? There are a lot of people waiting here. Some of us have lives.
Patrick (live-action): Oh, don't rush me! I almost had it! Uh...
Patrick: [laughs and spits out the ketchup packet] That guy's so dumb!
[Just then, a woman in an astronaut suit, who appears to be a reenactment of Sandy, walks up to the cash register and she's not very happy.]
Carol: Where in tarnation is my lunch?! The service here is slower than a three-legged dog in molasses!
[The other customers chatter in agreement. Just then, a man, who appears to be a reenactment of Mr. Krabs, hears the commotion and comes out of his office.]
Mr. Slabs: [gasps] Me customers! All right, all right, all right! What's the hold up here, Mr. Manward?
Mr. Manward: How should I know? Go ask your persnickety fry cook. Between him and this other idiot, we're not gonna make it through the lunch rush alive.
Mr. Slabs: Well, I'll just see about that! [takes Patrick's dollar and puts it in the cash register] You'll be having the number three with cheese!
Patrick (live-action): Aw, that's what I was gonna order. [Mr. Manward rolls his eyes in annoyance] I'll have the—the number cheese with cheese.
Mr. Manward: Don't you have somewhere else to be a nitwit?
Patrick (live-action): Not until 4:00.
[Mr. Manward facepalms in disgust as Mr. Slabs laughs, thinking it was a joke. He heads into the kitchen where the chef, who appears to be a reenactment of SpongeBob, is busying making food on the grill. Rube drives onto the little window between the kitchen and the cash register to get a closer look.]
Mr. Slabs: [comes in the kitchen] JimBob!
JimBob: Hi!
Mr. Slabs: Got a restaurant full of hungry customers out there! Where are the burgers?
JimBob: Ooh, Mr. Slabs, you know that I can't serve a Slabby Patty ♪until it's cooked just right!♪ [gently pinches Mr. Slabs' cheek] ♪Slabby Patty and it's cooked just right, Slabby Patty, day and night, what a nifty tasty sight! Slabby Patty and it's cooked just right—[continues singing]♪
SpongeBob: I love this guy! [laughs]
JimBob: [rapidly spins around and around] ♪Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo! Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo!♪
Mr. Slabs: Enough of that!
JimBob: Sorry, sir.
Mr. Slabs: Get those ship-shape burgers shipped out or you'll be doing soft shoe across the street at the Crumb Basket!
[The Crumb Basket, which is the reenactment version of the Chum Bucket back in Bikini Bottom, appears on the screen for a split second.]
JimBob: Yes, Mr. Slabs. It won't happen again, Mr. Slabs. Sorry, Mr. Slabs.
Mr. Slabs: [grunts angrily] Hmm, that'll be the day...
JimBob: All right, troops, prepare to be deployed! [forms multiple arms with spatulas and makes karate yells]
[JimBob resumes his work and prepares the Slabby Patties in a fast speed.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
[JimBob rapidly flips several Slabby Patties in the air, which makes Patrick's mouth water.]
Patrick: Giant patties! [sighs and faints]
JimBob: [flips his spatula around and laughs] What fun!
SpongeBob: [his pupils form into spatulas] Ooh, I just gotta get a closer look at that glorious spatula! [hops out of the bus and rushes over to JimBob's spatula; he smothers it until JimBob grabs it and flips more Slabby Patties]
[JimBob makes three perfect patties. He makes a plate with one Slabby Patty and fries.]
JimBob: Oops, forgot the cheese! [grabs SpongeBob and places it on the Slabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Oh! Patrick! Patrick, help!
[JimBob places the top bun onto SpongeBob and goes to serve it.]
Patrick: [wakes up after hearing SpongeBob's cries for help] Huh? [leans against the window and sees JimBob serving the Slabby Patty with SpongeBob on it] Oh! I'm coming, buddy!
[Patrick takes a deep breath, climbs out of the bus, takes the Slabby Patty with SpongeBob on it, and jumps back into the bus before Mr. Manward takes the plate. Patrick rips a nearly melted SpongeBob off the Slabby Patty and sets him down.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Never get out of the bus, Patrick. Never get out of the bus!
Patrick: Who's hungry?
[The tourists cheer happily.]
Rube: Amazing! Lunch time, everybody!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the tourists gobble down the Slabby Patty. Mr. Manward serves the plate to Carol. Just as she was about to eat it, she sees that the sandwich doesn't have any meat in it.]
Carol: Where's the meat? Dagnabit! That's it! [gets up and grabs her helmet] I'm taking my business elsewhere!
[Suddenly, a masked man, who appears to be a reenactment of Plankton, comes in and points a ray gun in Carol's face.]
Mr. Charleston: You're not going anywhere, sister! Sit down! [Carol reluctantly does so] And everybody freeze! This is a robbery! [everyone raises their hands in the air; Mr. Slabs peaks out through the window] Slabs! [Mr. Slabs gasps] Show yourself!
Mr. Slabs: [comes out and hovers over the cash register, much to Mr. Manward's annoyance] You can only have me register over me cold lifeless shell!
Mr. Charleston: Nobody wants your stupid money.
Mr. Slabs: Huh?
Mr. Charleston: Hand over the Slabby Patty secret sauce recipe and nobody gets vaporized, see? [laughs as he activates the ray gun; SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists gasp in terror] You all have until the count of three. A-one, a-two...
Carol: [gets up from the table and karate chops Mr. Charleston to the floor] Ha! Karate chop! [Mr. Charleston groans] You're welcome!
[Mr. Slabs and Mr. Manward look at each other in amusement. Carol angrily storms out of the restaurant as Mr. Slabs laughs at Mr. Charleston's downfall.]
Patrick: Ha! She chopped him real good!
Mr. Slabs: Fear not, gentle customers. This is not a robber. [Mr. Manward sulks] This is my lame competition across the street, [removes Mr. Charleston's mask] Charleston! [laughs]
Mr. Charleston: What gave me away? My voice?
Mr. Slabs: No, your knit cap had one eye hole.
Mr. Charleston: Ugh! Foiled by a hand crocheted gift! Mark my words, Slabs, maybe not today but, oh, someday, that secret sauce recipe will be mine! [laughs just before Mr. Slabs pulls him back]
Mr. Slabs: Nice try, weirdo. [throws Mr. Charleston out into the garbage and heads back in the restaurant to resume business]
Mr. Charleston: [groans] Where am I?
[With the crisis over, Rube drives the bus and prepares to leave the restaurant.]
Rube: Well, feeding time is over. Hang on, everybody!
[Rube drives the bus under Patchy's legs, who had just entered the restaurant with Potty.]
Patchy: Eh, my Potty needs to use your potty.
Mr. Manward: Sorry. No.
Patchy: Sorry, Potty, you'll have to hold it. Come on! [walks into the restaurant and Potty follows]
Potty: [squawks] Easy for you to say!
Rube: [drives over Mr. Charleston's leg by accident] Oh, excuse me, sir. [drives over his other leg] Oh, pardon me!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick with their stomachs full from the Slabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, that was delicious. I love surface food! [belches]
[Charlie wipes his face with a napkin.]
Patrick: You missed a spot. [licks the food off Charlie's face]
Charlie: Ugh! Thanks.
Rube: Okay, everybody, the next point of interest is coming up in just a few short minutes, so just relax and enjoy the—[SpongeBob hops onto Rube's head]
SpongeBob: Stop the bus! [Rube frantically stops the bus, knocking Patrick and the tourists off their seats] Rube, what is that?! [points to a local fish store]
Rube: Oh, that's what they call a fish prison. And one thing is for sure, you don't ever want to end up in there.
[Just then, a young woman, who appears to be a reenactment of Pearl, comes by and finds the bus. She believes that the bus was just a random fish tank sitting in the street. SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists scream in fear.]
Pearl Slabs: Huh? [picks up the bus] Who left this aquarium out here? [carries it into the store as SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists continue screaming; a customer kindly holds the door open for her] Hi, nice to meet you! [chuckles as she enters the store with the bus]
[Meanwhile, Old Man Walker continues to sleep on the sidewalk as the sun sets. One side of SpongeBob's house falls down. Inside, all of the party guests are getting exhausted from all the dancing, including Sandy.]
Sandy: I feel like I've got three wheels down and my axles are dragging. [Bubble Bass falls on her] Where in tarnation is SpongeBob?
[Back on the surface world, SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists are still in the fish store.]
SpongeBob: No!
[Pearl places the bus on the top shelf of the store.]
Pearl Slabs: There! That's better!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the tourists gasps.]
Rube: Okay, no need to panic, everyone. Just a slight delay! Heh. [drives the bus back and forth] Come on. [continues backing up and moving forward]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists: [seeing various fish swimming in tanks] Ooh!
SpongeBob: What kind of monster would want to keep fish folk in jail like this? They're so beautiful.
Patrick: Yeah! [sees a beautiful purple fish] Aww. [a heart forms around the purple fish] I want to kiss that one! [kiss the glass]
SpongeBob: Uh, [chuckles] I'm just gonna head back to my seat. [heads back to his seat]
Rube: [jiggling with the lever] Come on. Come on!
Patrick: Having trouble?
Rube: Yeah. It's amazing. I can't get this dang thing to budge.
Patrick: Uh, hey! I have a great idea! I'll be right back! [runs out of the bus]
Rube: Well, while we wait for the great idea, [grabs SpongeBob] let's all sing "Happy Birthday" to our fellow passenger!
Rube and the tourists: ♪Happy—♪
[Suddenly, the bus begins to move and it was pushed off the shelf by Patrick. The bus crashes down to the floor.]
Patrick: [removes to clothes pin from his nose and jumps down to the bus] Ho, ho! [falls on Rube's head and chuckles] I just knew that empty aquarium would break your fall!
Rube: That was a great idea, Patrick! Now we can get out of this scary place.
SpongeBob: [jumps on the steering wheel] Wait, Rube! We can't leave all these fish behind!
Patrick: Yeah! I'm in love!
[The purple fish looks down at Patrick.]
Rube: I understand how you feel, Birthday Bob, but what can we do about it?
[Patrick slides off Rube's head. The scene changes with Rube driving the bus on the sidewalk with all of the fish SpongeBob and Patrick freed from the fish store.]
SpongeBob: [rides on a blue clowfish] Ooh! [chuckles] Whee!
[Patrick giggles as the purple fish kisses him. SpongeBob swims over Rube while he drives.]
Rube: This is the most amazing thing I've ever done! [giggles]
[SpongeBob rides over Rube again.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the tourists: To the beach!
[The scene changes to Rube driving the bus back to the beach.]
Rube: Okay, everyone, we are about to begin our final descent into Bikini Bottom. So this is your last chance to take snapshots before we submerge.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists take pictures with their cameras as Rube drives the bus to the ocean. The man and his dog are playing fetch together, only this time, the man is the one who's fetching while the dog does the frisbee throwing. The dog throws the frisbee out. The man looks at his dog, but the dog tells him to go get it. The man chuckles and runs off to get the frisbee.]
Dog Walker: [panting while running] Dog! [gets the frisbee from the shore and carries it by the mouth] Yeah!
[Rube drives by Beanie McBeans throwing beans at his fans.]
Beanie McBeans: Beans! [throws a bucket of bean slime at some beach goers]
[The beach goers cheer as the bus drives closer to the shore.]
Patrick: I'm so hungry still.
SpongeBob: Did you see that?
David Hasselholf: [sees the French Narrator's submarine emerging from the ocean] Wow, it's a submarine! That's amazing!
Rube: [drives over David Hasselholf's toes] Whoops! Excuse me!
Potty: Brawk! I'm outta here! [flies away]
David Hasselholf: [turns around and sees Patchy on his bicycle behind him] Hey, you ran over my foot!
Patchy: Uh, I don't think so. I—
David Hasselholf: [pulls Patchy's hat down his face and picks up his lifeguard floating device] I've had it with the beach! I'm going to live in a volcano, where it's safe. [angrily storms off, limping]
[As Patchy struggles to pull his hat back off, SpongeBob looks at the surface world one last time while the bus begins to descend back into the ocean.]
SpongeBob: Good-bye, sweet Surface Land. I'll never forget you.
[Rube drives the bus onto the French Narrator's submarine and it slowly starts to descend down into the ocean. The fish from the fish store swim out of the bus, including the purple fish Patrick was smitten over.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the tourists: Good-bye! Bye!
Patrick: Good-bye, my love! [kisses the glass]
[The purple fish gives Patrick a blow kiss good-bye. Back on the surface, Patchy pulls his head out of his hat as Potty comes flying by.]
Patchy: [sarcastically] Thanks for sticking up for me, Potty, ya big coward!
Potty: I moved like a cat!
Patchy: I hope that beach bozo didn't damage SpongeBob's gift! [pulls out a telescope] Now if I can only find a way to get out to— [sees Bikini Atoll up ahead] Ooh! That island! [puts his telescope away] Then I can drop the present over Bikini Bottom.
Potty: Maybe you could take a ride on that? [points to Beanie McBeans' cannon]
Patchy: Ooh! [his hat spins wildly as he laughs with joy; he gratefully hugs and kisses Potty, much to his parrot's disgust, and jumps into the cannon] All right, Potty, I'm ready! Fire!
Potty: [ignites the cannon] Bombs away!
[The cannon fires Patchy and sends him flying across through the air as Potty flies. Patchy and Potty land on Bikini Atoll. But upon landing, their feet are sticking out from the sand.]
Potty: Hooray! Yippee!
Patchy: We did it! Potty, we did it!
[Meanwhile, back in Bikini Bottom, it is nighttime. Rube pulls the bus over in front of a pile of rubble, which used to be SpongeBob's house.]
Rube: Well, that's the end of our tour, folks. I hope you all enjoyed yourselves. I sure as heck did!
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the bus.]
SpongeBob: You were right, Rube, that was...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Amazing!
Rube: I'm just sorry we never had time to sing "Happy Birthday" to ya, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Well, how about now?
Rube: You got it, birthday boy! Let's sing "Happy Birthday," everyone! A-one and a-two...
Rube and the tourists: ♪Happy birthday—♪
[Rube accidentally pushes the lever and the bus drives out of sight.]
SpongeBob: Nice try! Maybe next year!
[Old Man Walker wakes up from his sleep, pulls out two empty bottles and sees SpongeBob and Patrick standing on the road.]
Old Man Walker: Oh, no! He's here! He's here! SpongeBob! SpongeBob is here!
SpongeBob: Well, of course I'm here. Great job with your walker! You walked really far.
Patrick:  Maybe I should get one of these walking things. [puts on some glasses] How many miles to the gallon?
SpongeBob: Why don't we just let Old Man Walker get home, Patrick?
Old Man Walker: Home? No, I—
Patrick: Here, let me help. [places a tray with wheels on it under Old Man Walker's walker and pushes him down the street] Pow!
Old Man Walker: SpongeBob's here!
[Old Man Walker crashes into something and explodes. SpongeBob and Patrick wave good-bye.]
SpongeBob: [giggles] I hope I'm that spry when I'm his age. [heads to the front door with Patrick and digs into his pocket to get his keys] Huh. Must have forgotten to take my keys.
Patrick: It looks open.
[The front door falls over. SpongeBob and Patrick sees the entire house as well as the party completely destroyed and everyone is sound asleep.]
SpongeBob's friends, family, and party guests: [sleepily] Surprise... [goes back to sleep]
[It looked more like a slumber party than a surprise birthday party. But SpongeBob doesn't seem to care about that, even after they destroyed his house while waiting.]
SpongeBob: A surprise party? For me?
Patrick: Oh, yeah. I was gonna tell you. [holds out a bag of beans and throws some beans at SpongeBob] Surprise! [goes to sleep with everyone]
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, everybody. You've made this the best birthday I ever had. My spongy heart is bursting with joy 'cause I know I have the love of my pet, Gary... [hugs his sleeping snail]
Gary: [sleepily] Meow.
SpongeBob: And my family... [kisses them as they sleep] and I have the love of my friends. [turns around and looks at the horizon] And I live in the bestest place in the whole wide world, Bikini Bottom, where nothing bad can ever happen, and there's nothing to ever, ever be scared of.
[Just then, a shadow looms over SpongeBob. SpongeBob screams in fright and an object falls onto him. The smoke clears and it turns out to be Patchy's birthday gift to SpongeBob. SpongeBob puts his face back on and looks at the present.]
SpongeBob: [reads the tag] "From your biggest fan." Hmm? I have a fan?
[SpongeBob opens the box and the present revealed to be none other than Patchy the Pirate, but just his head.]
Patchy: Ahh, surprise! [chuckles] It's Patchy the Pirate! Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh! [his body forms into an eye before blinking back to normal and shedding tears] Thank you, Patchy! [hugs Patchy]
[SpongeBob and Patchy burst into a heartily laughter.]
Patchy: Guess I didn't really think this head-in-a-box thing through all the way. I don't really know what to do now. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Well, I still haven't gotten my birthday song.
Patchy: Ooh, you'll get it now! [starts singing] ♪Ooh, who's having a birthday under the sea?♪
SpongeBob: ♪Me, me, me, me!♪
[The song wakes everybody up and they join in the celebration.]
Patchy: ♪With presents and cake and caller ID♪
SpongeBob's friends, family, and party guests: ♪SpongeBob SquarePants♪
Patchy: ♪Would you like to send him a nice birthday wish?♪
SpongeBob's friends, family, and party guests: ♪Yes, we would!♪
[The scene changes to Bikini Atoll. Patchy's body lies in the sand and it turns out that Patchy switched heads with Potty.]
Potty: [squawks] ♪Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish♪
[The screen changes into the background used for the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song, only it's birthday themed.]
SpongeBob's friends, family, and party guests: ♪SpongeBob SquarePants, SpongeBob SquarePants♪
[A montage of celebrities wishing SpongeBob a happy birthday, including several guest stars of the episode, is shown.]
David Hasselholf: Happy birthday, dude.
Kel Mitchell: Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
JoJo Siwa: [shouting to the ocean] SpongeBob, happy birthday!
Tiffany Haddish: Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
Thomas F. Wilson: Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
Sigourney Weaver: SpongeBob, it's your birthday. Congratulations.
Heidi Klum: Happy, happy birthday, SpongeBob!
Kal Penn: Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
[On other prints, John Goodman is after Kal.]
John Goodman: Happy 20th, SpongeBob! [makes a thumbs up]
[On US prints, Lana Condor takes John's place.]
Lana Condor: Happy birthday, Spongebob! [prepares to blow him a kiss]
Jason Sudeikis: Happy birthday!
RuPaul: Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
Vernon Davis: Happy birthday, buddy!
Rob Gronkowski: Happy birthday, my friend!
Allan K. Washington, Danny Skinner, Ethan Slater, and Lilli Cooper: Happy birthday, SpongeBob! Happy birthday!
Gilbert Gottfried: Happy birthday, SpongeBob! [blows a noisemaker]
[We cut back to the episode.]
SpongeBob's friends, family, and party guests: ♪SpongeBob SquarePants!♪
SpongeBob: ♪Happy birthday to me! SpongeBob SquarePants!♪
[Everybody cheers as the song ends.]
Patrick: By the way, SpongeBob, how old are you?
SpongeBob: Well, as of today, I am—
[The screen turns fuzzy just as SpongeBob was about to reveal his current age. SpongeBob plays the last notes of the song. The screen turns black and a message that reads, "Thank you, Steve Hillenburg" is shown, ending the episode.]

Cut Version
[The episode starts with Patchy the Pirate struggling to start his boat.]
Patchy: Oh, hi, kids! Patchy Pirate here on a glorious day. I'm going to deliver this here very special present to SpongeBob on his birthday. That is, if I can get this blasted boat to start. [turns the ignition with his key] And start! [chuckles]
[Patchy's boat wouldn't start and Potty comes out of the trunk.]
Potty: Maybe if you remembered to fill the tank with gas...
Patchy: Oh, Potty, you're full of gas! Get outta here!
Potty: [flies onto the hood] I see the problem! [bangs on the hood with the hammer]
[The hood sent Patchy flying backwards and smashing into the garage door.]
Patchy: [groaning] Walking is better than driving anyway. I've been meaning to work on me land legs. [pulls up his pants and reveals his wavy legs]
Potty: Squawk, squawk!
Patchy: [takes the present from the trunk and happily laughs] Now to see which way the wind is blowing. [sticks his finger in his mouth, holds out his hand with a sail on it and the with blows the other direction] This way! [the wind blows Patchy down the street] Whoa!
Potty: [follows Patchy while squawking] Hard to port!
[Meanwhile, at the brink of dawn, SpongeBob is sleeping in his bed. Gary is holding a birthday present for SpongeBob while sleeping. Moments later, the alarm clock goes off.]
SpongeBob's alarm clock: Wake up!
Gary: [meows "Happy Birthday"]
SpongeBob: What? Today? My birthday? Oh, Gary, you know I never pay attention to those sorts of things.
[SpongeBob hops out of his bed and streamers and confetti fly out. He blows the noise maker a couple times and laughs. He opens Gary's present, which reveals to be a jellyfish net made out of slime.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, wow, Gary! Did you make me this jellyfishing net yourself?
Gary: [gives SpongeBob a thumb's up with his slime] Meow!
[SpongeBob swings the slime jellyfish net around, but splashes slime all over his bedroom. SpongeBob swings the net until it is gone.]
SpongeBob: Best present ever! [hugs Gary and laughs]
Patrick: [knocks on SpongeBob's front door]
SpongeBob: [answers the door] Hi, buddy.
Patrick: Uh...[drools a river of saliva]
[SpongeBob giggles happily and Patrick makes a creepy face while drooling. SpongeBob blows his noise maker and Patrick makes a even creepier face while drooling. Patrick drools out a saliva bubble from his mouth. The saliva bubble floats over to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] You remembered my birthday! [ties a string on the saliva bubble to make a balloon before it pops in his face]
[Patrick makes an uglier face while continuously drooling a river of saliva. Just then, a fish tank bus pulls over to SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: Oh, and you got me a sight-seeing bus tour as a present!
[Patrick turns around while drooling a river of saliva.]
Patrick: [wakes up from his stupidity] Huh? Oh, oh! No, SpongeBob. I got you a sightseeing tour as a present.
[SpongeBob closes the door while he and Patrick board the tour bus and drives away.]
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! Oh, this is so exciting! I wonder where we're going?
Rube: We're going to Surface Land! [pulls the lever and shows the sign on the bus saying, "Surface Land"]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: [exclaiming in amazement]
SpongeBob: Surface Land? [screams happily]
Patrick: [screams in fear]
Rube: [turns around to speak to the tourists] Hi, everybody, and welcome to Surface Land Tours! I'm your tour guide, Rube.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Hi, Rube!
Rube: Before we drive to the amazing Surface Land, I'm required to read you these tour bus rules. [takes out a long list of rules from his hat and reads] "Please sit in an upright position." [SpongeBob and Patrick sit upside down and gets into an upright position] "Absolutely no bad language!" [SpongeBob and Patrick say bad words as dolphin chirps are heard; they stop talking and cover their mouths] "No horseplay!" [SpongeBob and Patrick dance around in a horse suit and stop to sit back down] And no digging, no dancing, no tanning, no cooking, no fencing, no drowning, no molting, no running, no trespassing, no peeking, and no balloons!" [pops SpongeBob and Patrick with a needle when they appeared as balloons]
SpongeBob: Aww. Not even birthday balloons?
Rube: [gasps] Oh, my goodness! Is it your birthday?
SpongeBob: [his cheeks blow up and pop] Yes! [giggles]
Rube: Well, I would love for everyone to sing happy birthday to you! [puts a party hat on SpongeBob]
Tourist #1: Yes!
SpongeBob: Aww, really? That is so—
Rube: Not now, of course. Tour time is tight! [hops back into his driving seat] Whoa! [drives the bus back onto the road; then drives up a steep cliff, which makes every fall over] Okay, everybody, we're on Upseedaisy Street, and ready for lift off!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Lift off?
[Rube drives the bus upward to the sign that says "Dead End." SpongeBob and Patrick breath heavily in paper bags. The bus rockets up to the surface.]
Rube: Amazing!
SpongeBob: Oh, are we there yet?
Rube: Almost. But we need a little boast to the surface. [honks his horn]
[The bus descends downward until a submarine catches them.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
[Up on the surface, David Hasselhoff is kayaking on the water when the submarine knocks him over.]
[Rube drives the bus off the submarine before it descends back into the ocean.]
David Hasselhoff: [groans] Ah! Tartar sauce!
[Rube drives the bus out of the ocean and heads over to the beach.]
Rube: Now remember, everyone, keep your arms and legs inside the bus at all times 'cause we are about to encounter a gaggle of nearly naked beach giraffes!
[Rube drives the bus around the beach. They drive by a local fisherman in a raincoat.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh! [snaps photos with their cameras]
[The fisherman catches what he assumed a fish. But it turns out he hooked his own boot. Rube drives by the fisherman as the tour goes on. Rube drives the bus past some party goers who are having a beach party. Everyone was dancing with the musical beat and are having quite a blast. Rube drives over a sleeping man who is sunbathing. SpongeBob and Patrick are deeply amazed at what they are seeing. SpongeBob screams loudly.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nearly naked beach giraffes!
[The beach goers continue to dance. SpongeBob and Patrick hover onto Rube in deep fear.]
Rube: Don't worry, everyone. The beach giraffes may look crazy, but they're actually peaceful creatures. Let's get a closer look.
[Rube drives the bus through the crowd without getting themselves stepped on. SpongeBob and Patrick continuously scream as Rube drives. Rube stops the bus in front of the stage. A man in a "Can-O Beans" costume appears on the stage.]
Can: Hey, kids, welcome to Beach Blanket Bean-go! [everyone cheers; opens his lid] And here's your host, Beanie McBeans!
Beanie McBeans: [pops out of the can and the crowd cheers wildly] Hey! What do you want?
Beach Goers: Beans!
Beanie McBeans: When do you want them?
Beach Goers: Beans!
Beanie McBeans: Ha, ha!
Beach Goers: Beans, beans, beans...!
Beanie McBeans: [cheers] Beans, beans, good for your heart! They make you strong, they make you smart! When I eat beans, I squeal! I eat beans with every meal! You do, too! You know you do! [everyone cheers] Beans, beans! [throws beans at everyone] Beans, beans, beans! [throws more beans at everyone and dances around]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
Patrick: Oh, he's good.
Beanie McBeans: [to his first contestant] All right, you know the rules. First question: How many beans are in a 16 ounce can?
Contestant: Uh? Three million?
Beanie McBeans: Sorry! Wrong answer! [shoots bean slime from his cannon at his contestant]
[The audience gasps.]
Contestant: [short silence] Yeah!
[The audience cheers. Patrick starts to take a liking to beans and his mouth waters.]
Patrick: So many beans! [presses his face against the glass and whimpers]
SpongeBob: Uh-oh.
[Patrick could not resist and rushes over to the driver's seat.]
Rube: [gets pushed aside by Patrick] Whoa!
Patrick: Must have beans! [begins to drive wildly like a mad animal]
SpongeBob, Rube, and the tourists: Whoa! Uh-oh!
Patrick: Beans, beans, beans, beans, beans!
Beach Goers: Whoa! [feels Patrick running over their toes]
Rube: Stop! [screams]
[Patrick drives through the audience, skids over a man's back and flies over to the stage's microphone.]
Patrick: [jumps out of the bus] Wrong answer! [falls back in]
[Beanie McBeans fires bean slime from his cannon at the bus, which completely fills up with beans. Patrick goggles up all of the beans, but in doing so, drinks all of the water as well. Soon, everyone on the bus is drying up because of Patrick's arrogant actions. After eating the beans, Patrick sits down and is all dried up.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! You ate all the water!
Patrick: It's not my fault. The water got in the way!
Rube: Passengers, do not panic! We can get water right over there. [points to a beach shower and drives off the stage]
[Several beach goers are standing in line to clean the sand off. One man does some reflexes while cleaning himself. Then he picks up his beach toys and skips away. Then a woman takes a turn, only to clean the sand off her kickboard. SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the other tourists wait patiently in line.]
Female Beach Goer: [finishes cleaning the sand off her kickboard] Okay. Perfect! [picks up her towel and leaves]
[Then a tall man gets a turn at the beach shower. He cleans himself for a bit and leaves. Then it was SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the other tourists' turn. The shower fills the bus with water and everyone can breathe again.]
Rube: Ah! And we're back!
SpongeBob: Yeesh, I thought this was my birthday, not my deathday! [laughs as Patrick makes a scared look on his face] I'm sorry, Patrick. I was just kidding.
[Patrick screams as a big, white, fluffy dog approaches. Everyone on the bus panics upon seeing the dog for the first time.]
SpongeBob: Oh! What am I looking at?!
Rube: You're looking at an amazing creature that is just as afraid as you are of it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [peeking out from SpongeBob's pants] I doubt it!
Rube: I'm telling ya, that is a blue feathered northwestern pie-dragon. So calm down, guys. It only eats pies. [sees the dog drinking the water from the bus] I was wrong! It's gonna eat us! Run!
[Everyone panics and Rube drives the bus to get as far away from the dog as he can.]
Dog Walker: [gets pulled by the dog] Whoa!
[Rube is driving the bus over some high wires in a suburban area.]
SpongeBob: Wow! In Surface Land, everywhere you go is full of surprises!
Patrick: Yeah, I'm surprised we haven't crashed yet.
[Rube drives the bus through the airport as one airplane begins to take off.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Wow!
[Rube drives through the conveyer belt at a hardware store.]
Rube: Hey, is everybody hungry? Let's stop for a birthday lunch!
[Rube drives the bus over to a local fast food restaurant called the Trusty Slab, which is the reenactment version of the Krusty Krab back in Bikini Bottom. The office employees line up and enter the restaurant.]
SpongeBob: The Trusty Slab? Sounds familiar.
[Rube enters the restaurant through the front door.]
Rube: This is a example of typical feeding station for surface folk.
[The chef flips a patty and rings the bell.]
Rube: Let's watch these hungry beach giraffes as they struggle to communicate.
[As they watch, a man, who appears to be a reenactment of Patrick Star, is at the cash register, struggling to decide what to eat. The cashier, who appears to be a reenactment of Squidward, is waiting impatiently.]
Patrick (live-action): No, no, wait! Uh, I'll have the, uh...
Mr. Manward: Sir, could you please order something? There are a lot of people waiting here. Some of us have lives.
Patrick (live-action): Oh, don't rush me! I almost had it! Uh...
Patrick: [laughs and spits out the ketchup packet] That guy's so dumb!
[Just then, a woman in an astronaut suit, who appears to be a reenactment of Sandy, walks up to the cash register and she's not very happy.]
Carol: Where in tarnation is my lunch?! The service here is slower than a three-legged dog in molasses!
[The other customers chatter in agreement. Just then, a man, who appears to be a reenactment of Mr. Krabs, hears the commotion and comes out of his office.]
Mr. Slabs: [gasps] Me customers! All right, all right, all right! What's the hold up here, Mr. Manward?
Mr. Manward: How should I know? Go ask your persnickety fry cook. Between him and this other idiot, we're not gonna make it through the lunch rush alive.
Mr. Slabs: Well, I'll just see about that! [takes Patrick's dollar and puts it in the cash register] You'll be having the number three with cheese!
Patrick (live-action): Aw, that's what I was gonna order. [Mr. Manward rolls his eyes in annoyance] I'll have the—the number cheese with cheese.
Mr. Manward: Don't you have somewhere else to be a nitwit?
Patrick (live-action): Not until 4:00.
[Mr. Manward facepalms in disgust as Mr. Slabs laughs, thinking it was a joke. He heads into the kitchen where the chef, who appears to be a reenactment of SpongeBob, is busying making food on the grill. Rube drives onto the little window between the kitchen and the cash register to get a closer look.]
Mr. Slabs: [comes in the kitchen] JimBob!
JimBob: Hi!
Mr. Slabs: Got a restaurant full of hungry customers out there! Where are the burgers?
JimBob: Ooh, Mr. Slabs, you know that I can't serve a Slabby Patty ♪until it's cooked just right!♪ [gently pinches Mr. Slabs' cheek] ♪Slabby Patty and it's cooked just right, Slabby Patty, day and night, what a nifty tasty sight! Slabby Patty and it's cooked just right—[continues singing]♪
SpongeBob: I love this guy! [laughs]
JimBob: [rapidly spins around and around] ♪Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo! Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo!♪
Mr. Slabs: Enough of that!
JimBob: Sorry, sir.
Mr. Slabs: Get those ship-shape burgers shipped out or you'll be doing soft shoe across the street at the Crumb Basket!
[The Crumb Basket, which is the reenactment version of the Chum Basket back in Bikini Bottom, appears on the screen for a split second.]
JimBob: Yes, Mr. Slabs. It won't happen again, Mr. Slabs. Sorry, Mr. Slabs.
Mr. Slabs: [grunts angrily] Hmm, that'll be the day...
JimBob: All right, troops, prepare to be deployed! [forms multiple arms with spatulas and makes karate yells]
[JimBob resumes his work and prepares the Slabby Patties in a fast speed.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
[JimBob rapidly flips several Slabby Patties in the air, which makes Patrick's mouth water.]
Patrick: Giant patties! [sighs and faints]
JimBob: [flips his spatula around and laughs] What fun!
SpongeBob: [his pupils form into spatulas] Ooh, I just gotta get a closer look at that glorious spatula! [hops out of the bus and rushes over to JimBob's spatula; he smothers it until JimBob grabs it and flips more Slabby Patties]
[JimBob makes three perfect patties. He makes a plate with one Slabby Patty and fries.]
JimBob: Oops, forgot the cheese! [grabs SpongeBob and places it on the Slabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Oh! Patrick! Patrick, help!
[JimBob places the top bun onto SpongeBob and goes to serve it.]
Patrick: [wakes up after hearing SpongeBob's cries for help] Huh? [leans against the window and sees JimBob serving the Slabby Patty with SpongeBob on it] Oh! I'm coming, buddy!
[Patrick takes a deep breath, climbs out of the bus, takes the Slabby Patty with SpongeBob on it, and jumps back into the bus before Mr. Manward takes the plate. Patrick rips a nearly melted SpongeBob off the Slabby Patty and sets him down.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Never get out of the bus, Patrick. Never get out of the bus!
Patrick: Who's hungry?
[The tourists cheer happily.]
Rube: Amazing! Lunch time, everybody!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the tourists gobble down the Slabby Patty. Mr. Manward serves the plate to Carol. Just as she was about to eat it, she sees that the sandwich doesn't have any meat in it.]
Carol: Where's the meat? Dagnabit! That's it! [gets up and grabs her helmet] I'm taking my business elsewhere!
[Suddenly, a masked man, who appears to be a reenactment of Plankton, comes in and points a ray gun in Carol's face.]
Mr. Charleston: You're not going anywhere, sister! Sit down! [Carol reluctantly does so] And everybody freeze! This is a robbery! [everyone raises their hands in the air; Mr. Slabs peaks out through the window] Slabs! [Mr. Slabs gasps] Show yourself!
Mr. Slabs: [comes out and hovers over the cash register, much to Mr. Manward's annoyance] You can only have me register over me cold lifeless shell!
Mr. Charleston: Nobody wants your stupid money.
Mr. Slabs: Huh?
Mr. Charleston: Hand over the Slabby Patty secret sauce recipe and nobody gets vaporized, see? [laughs as he activates the ray gun; SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists gasp in terror] You all have until the count of three. A-one, a-two...
Carol: [gets up from the table and karate chops Mr. Charleston to the floor] Ha! Karate chop! [Mr. Charleston groans] You're welcome!
[Mr. Slabs and Mr. Manward look at each other in amusement. Carol angrily storms out of the restaurant as Mr. Slabs laughs at Mr. Charleston's downfall.]
Patrick: Ha! She chopped him real good!
Mr. Slabs: Fear not, gentle customers. This is not a robber. [Mr. Manward sulks] This is my lame competition across the street, [removes Mr. Charleston's mask] Charleston! [laughs]
Mr. Charleston: What gave me away? My voice?
Mr. Slabs: No, your knit cap had one eye hole.
Mr. Charleston: Ugh! Foiled by a hand crocheted gift! Mark my words, Slabs, maybe not today but, oh, someday, that secret sauce recipe will be mine! [laughs just before Mr. Slabs pulls him back]
Mr. Slabs: Nice try, weirdo. [throws Mr. Charleston out into the garbage and heads back in the restaurant to resume business]
Mr. Charleston: [groans] Where am I?
[With the crisis over, Rube drives the bus and prepares to leave the restaurant.]
Rube: Well, feeding time is over. Hang on, everybody!
[Rube drives the bus under Patchy's legs, who had just entered the restaurant with Potty.]
Patchy: Eh, my Potty needs to use your potty.
Mr. Manward: Sorry. No.
Patchy: Sorry, Potty, you'll have to hold it. Come on! [walks into the restaurant and Potty follows]
Potty: [squawks] Easy for you to say!
Rube: [drives over Mr. Charleston's leg by accident] Oh, excuse me, sir. [drives over his other leg] Oh, pardon me!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick with their stomachs full from the Slabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, that was delicious. I love surface food! [belches]
[Charlie wipes his face with a napkin.]
Patrick: You missed a spot. [licks the food off Charlie's face]
Charlie: Ugh! Thanks.
Rube: Okay, everybody, the next point of interest is coming up in just a few short minutes, so just relax and enjoy the—[SpongeBob hops onto Rube's head]
SpongeBob: Stop the bus! [Rube frantically stops the bus, knocking Patrick and the tourists off their seats] Rube, what is that?! [points to a local fish store]
Rube: Oh, that's what they call a fish prison. And one thing is for sure, you don't ever want to end up in there.
[Just then, a young woman, who appears to be a reenactment of Pearl, comes by and finds the bus. She believes that the bus was just a random fish tank sitting in the street. SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists scream in fear.]
Pearl Slabs: Huh? [picks up the bus] Who left this aquarium out here? [carries it into the store as SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists continue screaming; a customer kindly holds the door open for her] Hi, nice to meet you! [chuckles as she enters the store with the bus]
[Meanwhile, Old Man Walker continues to sleep on the sidewalk as the sun sets. One side of SpongeBob's house falls down. Inside, all of the party guests are getting exhausted from all the dancing, including Sandy.]
Sandy: I feel like I've got three wheels down and my axles are dragging. [Bubble Bass falls on her] Where in tarnation is SpongeBob?
[Back on the surface world, SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists are still in the fish store.]
SpongeBob: No!
[Pearl places the bus on the top shelf of the store.]
Pearl Slabs: There! That's better!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the tourists gasps.]
Rube: Okay, no need to panic, everyone. Just a slight delay! Heh. [drives the bus back and forth] Come on. [continues backing up and moving forward]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists: [seeing various fish swimming in tanks] Ooh!
SpongeBob: What kind of monster would want to keep fish folk in jail like this? They're so beautiful.
Patrick: Yeah! [sees a beautiful purple fish] Aww. [a heart forms around the purple fish] I want to kiss that one! [kiss the glass]
SpongeBob: Uh, [chuckles] I'm just gonna head back to my seat. [heads back to his seat]
Rube: [jiggling with the lever] Come on. Come on!
Patrick: Having trouble?
Rube: Yeah. It's amazing. I can't get this dang thing to budge.
Patrick: Uh, hey! I have a great idea! I'll be right back! [runs out of the bus]
Rube: Well, while we wait for the great idea, [grabs SpongeBob] let's all sing "Happy Birthday" to our fellow passenger!
Rube and the tourists: ♪Happy—♪
[Suddenly, the bus begins to move and it was pushed off the shelf by Patrick. The bus crashes down to the floor.]
Patrick: [removes to clothes pin from his nose and jumps down to the bus] Ho, ho! [falls on Rube's head and chuckles] I just knew that empty aquarium would break your fall!
Rube: That was a great idea, Patrick! Now we can get out of this scary place.
SpongeBob: [jumps on the steering wheel] Wait, Rube! We can't leave all these fish behind!
Patrick: Yeah! I'm in love!
[The purple fish looks down at Patrick.]
Rube: I understand how you feel, Birthday Bob, but what can we do about it?
[Patrick slides off Rube's head. The scene changes with Rube driving the bus on the sidewalk with all of the fish SpongeBob and Patrick freed from the fish store.]
SpongeBob: [rides on a blue clowfish] Ooh! [chuckles] Whee!
[Patrick giggles as the purple fish kisses him. SpongeBob swims over Rube while he drives.]
Rube: This is the most amazing thing I've ever done! [giggles]
[SpongeBob rides over Rube again.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the tourists: To the beach!
[The scene changes to Rube driving the bus back to the beach.]
Rube: Okay, everyone, we are about to begin our final descent into Bikini Bottom. So this is your last chance to take snapshots before we submerge.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists take pictures with their cameras as Rube drives the bus to the ocean. The man and his dog are playing fetch together, only this time, the man is the one who's fetching while the dog does the frisbee throwing. The dog throws the frisbee out. The man looks at his dog, but the dog tells him to go get it. The man chuckles and runs off to get the frisbee.]
Dog Walker: [panting while running] Dog! [gets the frisbee from the shore and carries it by the mouth] Yeah!
[Rube drives by Beanie McBeans throwing beans at his fans.]
Beanie McBeans: Beans! [throws a bucket of bean slime at some beach goers]
[The beach goers cheer as the bus drives closer to the shore.]
Patrick: I'm so hungry still.
SpongeBob: Did you see that?
David Hasselholf: [sees the French Narrator's submarine emerging from the ocean] Wow, it's a submarine! That's amazing!
Rube: [drives over David Hasselholf's toes] Whoops! Excuse me!
Potty: Brawk! I'm outta here! [flies away]
David Hasselholf: [turns around and sees Patchy on his bicycle behind him] Hey, you ran over my foot!
Patchy: Uh, I don't think so. I—
David Hasselholf: [pulls Patchy's hat down his face and picks up his lifeguard floating device] I've had it with the beach! I'm going to live in a volcano, where it's safe. [angrily storms off, limping]
[As Patchy struggles to pull his hat back off, SpongeBob looks at the surface world one last time while the bus begins to descend back into the ocean.]
SpongeBob: Good-bye, sweet Surface Land. I'll never forget you.
[Rube drives the bus onto the French Narrator's submarine and it slowly starts to descend down into the ocean. The fish from the fish store swim out of the bus, including the purple fish Patrick was smitten over.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the tourists: Good-bye! Bye!
Patrick: Good-bye, my love! [kisses the glass]
[The purple fish gives Patrick a blow kiss good-bye. Back on the surface, Patchy pulls his head out of his hat as Potty comes flying by.]
Patchy: [sarcastically] Thanks for sticking up for me, Potty, ya big coward!
Potty: I moved like a cat!
Patchy: I hope that beach bozo didn't damage SpongeBob's gift! [pulls out a telescope] Now if I can only find a way to get out to— [sees Bikini Atoll up ahead] Ooh! That island! [puts his telescope away] Then I can drop the present over Bikini Bottom.
Potty: Maybe you could take a ride on that? [points to Beanie McBeans' cannon]
Patchy: Ooh! [his hat spins wildly as he laughs with joy; he gratefully hugs and kisses Potty, much to his parrot's disgust, and jumps into the cannon] All right, Potty, I'm ready! Fire!
Potty: [ignites the cannon] Bombs away!
[The cannon fires Patchy and sends him flying across through the air as Potty flies. Patchy and Potty land on Bikini Atoll. But upon landing, their feet are sticking out from the sand.]
Potty: Hooray! Yippee!
Patchy: We did it! Potty, we did it!
[Meanwhile, back in Bikini Bottom, it is nighttime. Rube pulls the bus over in front of a pile of rubble, which used to be SpongeBob's house.]
Rube: Well, that's the end of our tour, folks. I hope you all enjoyed yourselves. I sure as heck did!
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the bus.]
SpongeBob: You were right, Rube, that was...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Amazing!
Rube: I'm just sorry we never had time to sing "Happy Birthday" to ya, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Well, how about now?
Rube: You got it, birthday boy! Let's sing "Happy Birthday," everyone! A-one and a-two...
Rube and the tourists: ♪Happy birthday—♪
[Rube accidentally pushes the lever and the bus drives out of sight.]
SpongeBob: Nice try! Maybe next year! My birthday in Surface Land sure was fun. But nothing beats Bikini Bottom! Where nothing bad can ever happen, and there's nothing to ever, ever be scared of.
[Just then, a shadow looms over SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Look out!
[SpongeBob screams in fright and an object falls onto him. The smoke clears and it turns out to be Patchy's birthday gift to SpongeBob. SpongeBob puts his face back on and looks at the present.]
SpongeBob: [reads the tag] "From your biggest fan." Hmm? I have a fan?
[SpongeBob opens the box and the present revealed to be none other than Patchy the Pirate, but just his head.]
Patchy: Ahh, surprise! [chuckles] It's Patchy the Pirate! Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh! [his body forms into an eye before blinking back to normal and shedding tears] Thank you, Patchy! [hugs Patchy]
[SpongeBob and Patchy burst into a heartily laughter.]
Patchy: Guess I didn't really think this head-in-a-box thing through all the way. I don't really know what to do now. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Well, I still haven't gotten my birthday song.
Patchy: Ooh, you'll get it now! [starts singing] ♪Ooh, who's having a birthday under the sea?♪
SpongeBob: ♪Me, me, me, me!♪
[The song wakes everybody up and they join in the celebration.]
Patchy: ♪With presents and cake and caller ID♪
SpongeBob's friends, family, and party guests: ♪SpongeBob SquarePants♪
Patchy: ♪Would you like to send him a nice birthday wish?♪
SpongeBob's friends, family, and party guests: ♪Yes, we would!♪
[The scene changes to Bikini Atoll. Patchy's body lies in the sand and it turns out that Patchy switched heads with Potty.]
Potty: [squawks] ♪Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish♪
[The screen changes into the background used for the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song, only it's birthday themed.]
SpongeBob's friends, family, and party guests: ♪SpongeBob SquarePants, SpongeBob SquarePants, SpongeBob SquarePants!♪
SpongeBob: ♪Happy birthday to me! SpongeBob SquarePants!♪
[Everybody cheers as the song ends.]
Patrick: By the way, SpongeBob, how old are you?
SpongeBob: Well, as of today, I am—
[The screen turns fuzzy just as SpongeBob was about to reveal his current age. SpongeBob plays the last notes of the song. The screen turns black and a message that reads, "Thank you, Steve Hillenburg" is shown, ending the episode.]


[The episode starts off in Larry's Gym at night; the lights turn off, as Frank, the Muscular Goldfish, goes into the arm wrestling ring. The scene then cuts to Mr. Krabs arm-wrestling with a muscular fish.]
Announcer: [from off-screen] Welcome, everyone, to the Secret Anchor Arm-Wrestling Club!
Jim the Wrestler: Yeah! [chest muscles flex]
[Both Mr. Krabs and his opponent are seen struggling to beat each other, groaning.]
Tough Green Fish: Give it up, old man! You're nothing but a softshell, Krabs!
[They are still struggling to beat each other until Mr. Krabs pinches his opponent's hand with his claw. His opponent screams in pain and crashes into the table. The spectators cheer for Mr. Krabs as he smiles smugly.]
Tough Purple Fish: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: I win — again! [laughs] That's me penny-pinching hand. [holds a penny in his claw and laughs]
[The Popeye fish and another tough fish walks in and carries Mr. Krabs's opponent out. Another fish brings in a new table.]
Mr. Krabs: This old soft-shell... is ready to twist another wrist! Who's next? [eyes stretch out to Reg, who declines, and to another tough fish]
Plankton: [from behind the spectators] I am! [spectators gasp and step aside to reveal Plankton] You got a problem with that, Eugene? [to the spectators] His name's Eugene, by the way!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] I got no problem with that, Sheldon. [to the spectators] His name's Sheldon, by the way.
[The Popeye fish and his partner bring in a smaller table and places it on top of the main table. The spectators cheer as Mr. Krabs and Plankton grasp each other's arms. The bell is rang by Larry the Lobster and the fight begins.]
Plankton: It's humiliation time, Krab-cake! I've been working out for months to bring you down! [muscles appear throughout his body]
Mr. Krabs: [struggling] What's — going on here? I can't... hold it —
Plankton: Any last words?
Mr. Krabs: Just... one! [lifts Plankton off the table] Sucker! [squishes Plankton with his claw and laughs]
[The spectators erupt in celebration.]
Jim the Wrestler: Yeah! [chest muscles flex]
Mr. Krabs: Next! [another tough fish arm-wrestles with him]
[Camera cuts to Plankton, groaning while trying to get up from the table, but gets squished again.]
Mr. Krabs: Next! [another tough purple fish arm-wrestles with him]
Plankton: I'll get — [gets squished]
Mr. Krabs: [from off-screen] Next!
Plankton: you — [gets squished again]
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] Next!
Plankton: Kra — [gets squished again] bss...!
Mr. Krabs: [sighs; picks Plankton up and uses him like a towel, then laughs and throws him away] I'm the champion... hands down!
[Mr. Krabs laugh and the spectators cheer for him, while Plankton crawls toward the gym's exit.]
Plankton: I'll get you for this, Krabs! You'll rue the day you —
Jim the Wrestler: [steps on Plankton] Yeah! [chest muscles flex]
[Scene cuts to Plankton crawling to the Chum Bucket, while groaning in pain.]
Plankton: Oh, why do I try to compete with Krabs? He always goes long and I always fall short! Will I ever get the upper hand?
[A scallop poops on Plankton causing him to look up. The scallop lands on the glove on top of the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: That's it! My glove! My big, beautiful, bone-crushing glove! Thank you, clam!
[Plankton is then seen working on the glove on top of the Chum Bucket as a thunderstorm brews in Bikini Bottom. Lightning strikes the glove and Plankton is blasted away; suddenly the glove gains life and starts to move.]
Plankton: The pinky is wiggling... wiggling! [laughs maniacally; the glove lets go of the Chum Bucket handle and jumps in front of Plankton] Let's see Krabs throw down this gauntlet! [boards the glove and rides it like a horse towards Larry's gym] Hi-ya!
[Scene cuts to Larry's Gym, where Mr. Krabs arm-wrestles and defeats other tough fish like Reg and the Popeye fish. Plankton hops onto the table, in front of Mr. Krabs.]
Plankton: I want a rematch, Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [dismisses Plankton] Boring. [shrugs] But whatevs.
Plankton: [pretends to be in pain, clutching his hand] Oh no, not a hand cramp! Not now! [smugly] Luckily I have a last-minute substitution, standing by. [takes a deep breath and blows a whistle]
[The ground rumbles and the Chum Bucket glove punches a hole into Larry's Gym. The glove then flicks the tough fish away with his fingers and makes its way to the wrestling table, about to wrestle with Mr. Krabs. Scene cuts to Larry the Lobster holding the mallet to ring the bell, but he faints onto the bell causing it to ring. The match between Mr. Krabs and the glove begins, and he struggles to defeat the glove.]
Mr. Krabs: [groaning in pain] Eeeh – oh, oh – oh — [Plankton is seen with an evil grin on his face, while Mr. Krabs continues to struggle] Any... last... words?
Plankton: [blows the whistle and the glove hoists Mr. Krabs up in the air] Just one... Sucker! [laughs maniacally while Mr. Krabs trembles in fear]
[The glove spins Mr. Krabs in the air and whacks him on the floor, causing a hole to form.]
Mr. Krabs:  [regains consciousness] Huh –? [shadow forms above him] No, no, no, no, no, no —
[The other tough fish fall above Mr. Krabs as the glove gathers them all into the hole on the floor. Plankton hops on top of the glove.]
Plankton: [raises arms in victory] Ta-daah! Let's give a big hand to the new champion! [applauds; then takes a deep breath and blows the whistle] Okay, move it, filthy fingers! [rides glove like a horse straight to the Krusty Krab] Aww, too bad Krabs isn't here to catch me with my glove in the cookie jar, heheh... Bust the door! [glove punches a hole into the Krusty Krab, flicking away the chairs and tables] Bust this one, too! [glove flicks the door of Mr. Krabs' office and goes in, creating a hole; the safe containing the secret formula is then seen] And now, for the secret formula! Open, said me! [hits glove with a whip but he is blasted off of the glove; the glove then growls at him and he hits the glove with the whip one more time] Go and hand me that, I command you! [glove takes whip from Plankton and he trembles in fear] Please don't hurt me! [glove flicks the whip away] Whew!
[The glove punches a hole into the kitchen and brings Plankton along. Plankton is then dipped into a container of hot sauce; afterwards, the container sizzles and Plankton is blasted off of the container onto the floor. Plankton screams in pain, slaps himself multiple times, afterwards, his antennae fizzles off and he rockets towards the sky. He falls back down into the Krusty Krab kitchen, screaming then groaning in pain.]
Fish #1: [from off-screen] Look out!
[Someone screams, and the glove is then seen leaving the Krusty Krab, flicking random Bikini Bottomites and their vehicles away, with two citizens landing on the Krusty Krab window. A boatmobile lands into the Krusty Krab, and Plankton hides himself after taking a peek at the commotion.]
Plankton: Uh-oh. That glove is gonna destroy Bikini Bottom and I'm gonna get blamed for it! [panics] I hate prison food! But I can't stop that monster all by myself... This is an emergency! [slips onto a puddle and becomes dizzy; his vision gradually clears itself and he sees an emergency box on the kitchen wall] Emergency box... That's convenient! [goes to the emergency box and opens it, revealing SpongeBob inside]
SpongeBob: [laughs; jumps off of the box and gives Plankton a salute] What is your emergency, Sir? [sees Plankton] Oh, hi, Plankton.
Plankton: I need a hand with something, kid. [takes SpongeBob with him, by the hand] Now do it!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Sir... No matter what the emergency, I've seen it all before.
[Scene cuts to the glove holding a boatmobile and controlling it, making it crash onto a Bikini Bottomite's boatmobile. The Bikini Bottomite runs away, screaming, and the glove throws the automobile it's holding onto the abandoned boatmobile. Plankton and SpongeBob are then seen watching the glove from a distance.]
SpongeBob: [screaming] I've never seen that before! [a burning automobile flies past and SpongeBob avoids it; the glove heard growling in the background]
Plankton: Usually it's sitting quietly on top of the Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob: Well, maybe we can talk to it.
Plankton: Talk is cheap! [whips out a stand with a button on top of it] Which leads you to push this button when I say so.
[SpongeBob, looking very excited, tries to push the button but Plankton slaps his hand away. Plankton is then seen boarding a tank loaded with missiles. Plankton aims it at the glove, who is seen crushing a boatmobile.]
Plankton: [shouting] Hey, Fistface! Prepare for annihilation! [to SpongeBob] Push the button, SpongeBob! [laughs maniacally, then pauses] Huh?
SpongeBob: [covering his eyes] Oh, I can't do it, I can't shoot the glove! [hides in his pants and points at the glove] It's – it's wiggling...
[The glove is seen grabbing a bus and squirting its passengers out. The passengers scream and run away as the glove throws the bus away.]
Plankton: [reaches for the button as his missiles point towards the sky] I must push it! [pushes the button and laughs maniacally as the missiles are launched towards the sky] What? [the missiles head down to the ground and hits Plankton and SpongeBob, causing an explosion; Plankton is then seen running on the tank's wheel like a treadmill, with his antennae burning] Why are you here again?
SpongeBob: I'm helping. [laughs; picks Plankton up] Listen to me, Plankton. You can't fight a big monster like that with hate. You can only defeat them with love. [tries to kiss Plankton but is slapped away]
Plankton: [groans in disgust] Love? That's too brutal... Let's do it! [SpongeBob's eyes turn into hearts and accidentally crushes Plankton with his hand]
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Plankton trying to fit into a giant glove.]
Timmy: [pointing somewhere] Daddy, I want it!
Harold: Now, Timmy, you already have one of those glove toys at home.
Timmy: [pointing at the glove toys] Not that one... [points to something off-screen] That one!
[Harold screams, and the Chum Bucket glove is then seen destroying property within Glove World, throwing a mini ferris wheel away. It stops in front of a mini merry-go-round filled with children.]
Kid Fish: Uh-oh.
[The Chum Bucket glove spins the mini merry-go-round, blasting the children away. The Glove World visitors scream and run away, and the glove flicks some of them off of his path.]
Hans: [from off-screen] Hey, Glove-zilla! [camera pans over to him, with SpongeBob and Plankton, and points at the Chum Bucket glove] Someone needs to teach you some Swedish manners! [clenches into a fist as a kid screams and runs away, then prepares to charge like a bull]
SpongeBob and Plankton: [points at the Chum Bucket glove off-screen] Sick 'em, Hans!
[Hans charges like a bull towards the Chum Bucket glove and pokes it, blasting SpongeBob and Plankton off onto a concessionaire stand. Afterwards, he picks out a mascot-wearing Glove World employee and flicks him away.]
Hans: I challenge you to a duel!
[Hans wrestles with the Chum Bucket glove. SpongeBob and Plankton are seen watching Hans wrestle the Chum Bucket glove.]
Plankton: Give him the old butt-kicking discount, Hans!
SpongeBob: But only love will defeat the glove!
[Hans continues to wrestle with the Chum Bucket glove. Hans pinches the Chum Bucket glove, while one of its fingers punch Hans away.]
SpongeBob: Oh, look, they're playing rock-paper-scissors! [Hans and the Chum Bucket glove play rock-paper-scissors while SpongeBob counts, off-screen] One, two, three! [Hans uses scissors]
Plankton: Yeah! Nothing beats scissors... [chuckles]
[The Chum Bucket glove uses rock and is hovering over Hans.]
SpongeBob: Oh, except rock...
[The Chum Bucket glove crushes Hans as SpongeBob and Plankton groan in pain. The Chum Bucket glove then proceeds to have a thumb war with Hans.]
SpongeBob: Oh my goodness, it's a thumb war!
[Hans continues to have a thumb war with the glove, which overpowers him and throws him onto a nearby ice cream stand, crushing it with their weight. They roll on the ground, towards SpongeBob and Plankton, who attempt to run away but end up being onboard Hans. The glove hurls them towards a bigger merry-go-round, and they all spin around as the glove continues its thumb war with Hans. They are all hurled off the merry-go-round, and the glove holds Hans down with its thumb. Hans is stuck under the glove's grasp.]
Hans: I can't defeat the glove, SpongeBob, it's too strong! You need to create a diversion.
SpongeBob: Diversion, eh?
[SpongeBob thinks of a diversion, and Plankton does the same, pacing back and forth.]
Plankton: Oh... Aha! [pauses] No...
[The scene alternates between SpongeBob and Plankton, who are both thinking. They suddenly get off of Hans.]
Plankton: We need a bullhorn, stat!
SpongeBob: [morphs nose into a bullhorn] I am a bullhorn, stat!
Plankton: [hops on SpongeBob and speaks into one of the holes; his voice amplified by bullhorn] Hey, Figure-face! Your grandma is a combat boot! [laughs]
[The Chum Bucket glove stops its thumb war with Hans and heads towards SpongeBob and Plankton, who both shiver in fear. The glove hovers over both of them and is about to attack, but Hans wears the glove.]
Hans: I got him! [poses] How do I look?
[The glove struggles to get off of Hans but is intercepted.]
SpongeBob: [admiringly] Aww, they fit each other just like a glove. [laughs]
Plankton: [imitates SpongeBob's laugh] Hardy-har-har.
Hans: He's harmless now, SpongeBob. See you tomorrow morning, I'll bring the pants! [leaves]
Plankton: [laughs, then realizes Hans left with his Chum Bucket glove] Wha–? Hey, come back! That glove is irreplaceable! Or is it?
[Scene cuts back into the Chum Bucket, whose glove is now replaced by a boot.]
Plankton: That looks way better than a glove! And it's a combat boot... to boot. [goes inside the Chum Bucket while singing to himself; then combat boot falls down] Ouch!
Jim the Wrestler: Yeah! [flexes his chest muscles]


[The episode begins at another day at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is happily flipping patties and humming to himself. Suddenly, Mr. Krabs and a man in a suit comes in the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Spatula down, sailor!
SpongeBob: [drops his spatula] What's going on, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: According to the nice man from the Labor Authority, it's time for your break, boy-o.
SpongeBob: [confused] We get breaks?
Labor authority officer: [very angry] Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles nervously] Well, of course you do, boy-o. Why, if I don't give you a five-minute break once every 20 years, this lovely man could fine me big bucks. [guides SpongeBob out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Nice meeting you.
Mr. Krabs: [sits SpongeBob on a table] And you don't want me to get fined, do you?
SpongeBob: [gasps] No! Never.
Mr. Krabs: Good! Then you just sit here and don't do or say nothing for five minutes [sees the labor authority officer in front of him] Oh—and enjoy your break. [laughs and walks off as the labor authority officer follows]
[SpongeBob sits quietly for a little while. He whistles to himself to pass the time. SpongeBob looks at the table and gasps when he sees a spot on it. He opens his face, grabs a cleaning spray and a rag and attempts to clean it.]
Mr. Krabs: [appears below the table] SpongeBob! What are you doing?!
SpongeBob: Uh, I just spotted a spot.
Mr. Krabs: You can't work on your break, boy-o! Period! Remember the fines?
Labor authority officer: [overhears it and gets real angry] I knew it! I've had my eye on you for years, Krabs! Oh, this violation is really gonna cost you! [looks through his list of fines given for the Krusty Krab] Hmm...
Mr. Krabs: [yelps] Oh, I can see we're gonna have to take drastic measures here.
[Mr. Krabs rushes to the wall and smashes through it between the kitchen and the restrooms. He takes a mallet and breaks down the wall, revealing the employee break room.]
SpongeBob: [reads the sign on the door] "Employee break room?" I never knew this was here!
[Mr. Krabs opens the door and turns on the light. It shows that the employee break room has not been used in years. It is covered in dust and cobwebs. Poison sea urchins crawl out from the room. SpongeBob looks around and see just how filthy the room is. But despite all that, he doesn't seem to mind it at all.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, it's beautiful! Like stepping through a portal into the magical realm beyond!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, whatever. Five minutes! [closes the door]
SpongeBob: I just hope there's enough time to enjoy everything. [opens an old refrigerator and sees old hot dogs in there] Ooh!
[SpongeBob takes the hot dogs and sticks them together with toothpicks to form a sausage carousel. He puts it in a microwave to heat up and watches it spin around.]
SpongeBob: Ooh. [laughs] Enjoy your carousel, my little hot dog friends. [laughs as he skips away]
[The hot dogs get so hot that they melt and burn in the microwave. Then they explode inside.]
SpongeBob: [pretending to surf as he rides on a chair in front of a wave poster] Surf's up! [falls over] Wipe out.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob taking out containers of old, moldy food. He opens one and the bad odor is let out. SpongeBob takes some moldy food, sniffs it and eats it.]
SpongeBob: I think this used to be...creamed corn!
[One moldy food comes to life.]
Blobby: Sorry, bub. Ha! I was meatloaf before I expired. [laughs and gives SpongeBob a high-five]
SpongeBob: Oh, Globby, you're so silly. [laughs until he starts to feel sick as his body slowly turns green and crumbles to the floor]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob making a band out of cleaning products.]
SpongeBob: Voilà! My break room band. Scrubby and the Cleaning Crew. Hmm... [looks at the control panel on one of his creations] Let's see if I wired everything right. [the panel sparkles; looks at the microwave and it sparkled too] Perfect. [uses the microwave as an electric guitar] Yeah!
[SpongeBob pumps up the music and uses steel wool as a disco ball. Meanwhile, the customers hear SpongeBob's music playing through the break room door.]
Gale Rechid: Huh? [hears music through the door] Ooh, music. I didn't know the Krusty Krab had a lounge. [throws her meal aside] Ooh! [opens the door and sees SpongeBob playing music]
[The other customers peak in and notices SpongeBob's music playing.]
Sandals: Shake a leg!
SpongeBob: Oh, come on in, everyone. Try the funk, it's fresh.
[All of the customers enter the break room and joins SpongeBob's dance party. Nat spins around on the floor and drills himself down. The moldy food gets into the groove as well.]
Blobby: [dances with a sea urchin] I sure dig that! There we go, yes!
[Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs exits his office and notices the restaurant completely empty.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Where'd all me paying customers go? [his eyestalks start feeling the musical beat] What—[stops his eyestalks from moving] Ow! What the— [opens the break room door and sees everyone dancing to SpongeBob's music] A party?! I don't remember charging anyone for a party on me premises!
[The labor authority officer was enjoying himself in the party as well.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah!
Mr. Krabs: [turns on the light] All right, that's it! Five minutes are up, SpongeBob! Break's over, everyone out! Everyone out! Out, out, out, out, out!
[All of the customers including the labor authority officer exit the break room in sadness.]
Labor authority officer: You're in compliance this time, Krabs. [gives Mr. Krabs the clipboard and turns to the customers] After-break at my house!
[The customers cheer and leave the Krusty Krab to have a party at the labor authority officer's house.]
SpongeBob: [exits the break room] Oh, Mr. Krabs, that was so much fun! I can't wait for my next break in 20 years!
[Mr. Krabs closes the door and hammers it shut with wood. Then he seals it up with bricks, more wallpaper and steel. Then puts a large boulder in front of it so no one can see the entrance to the break room.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs and rubs the dust off his claws] Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it, boy-o, 'cause it's time you got back to making me money.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs laughs as he heads back to his office. SpongeBob heads back into the kitchen to resume his job. He comes back out and notices the register boat is empty. Squidward is no where to be seen.]
SpongeBob: Hmm, wonder where Squidward got to. Oh, well. [heads back to the kitchen]
[The screen zooms back into break room and Squidward is relaxing inside. Squidward appears to be unaware that Mr. Krabs inexplicably trapped him inside. But as he sighs happily, he doesn't seem to care if he's stuck in the break room forever.]
Blobby: Hey, bub, have you seen my lid anywhere?
Squidward: [kicks Blobby away] Sorry, I'm on my break.


[The episode begins at Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat. Children are having a good time eating ice cream and playing with the Goofy Goober mascot. But there are some of them who are not having a good time. An angry long line of children are waiting impatiently as Patrick is hogging up all of the ice cream samples at the counter. He takes a sample and eats it.]
Squidina: [slowly losing her patience] Hey, you've sampled every flavor we have. Will you please just pick one?!
Patrick: Mm-mmm! Not so fast. I would now like to sample combinations of flavors, and I would like to use my spoon! [holds out a shovel]
Squidina: [pushes shovel away and calls security] Security. We have a sample mooch at the counter.
[The man in the Goofy Goober suit rushes over to the counter. He rips it off, revealing himself to be a security guard. He scoops Patrick up with an ice cream scooper and throws him out. Patrick whimpers sadly before two employees come out, sit on him, and eat ice cream together.]
Octavius Rex's coworker: Wow. I can't believe Goofy Goobers employees get to eat all the ice cream they want on this job.
Patrick: Hmm?
Octavius Rex: Yeah, but the rule is only on the first break. And for lunch, [eats some ice cream] and on the second break, and for dinner. [eats some more ice cream]
Octavius Rex's coworker: Wow! Ice cream all day! [gobbles down some more ice cream]
Octavius Rex: [voiceover as the words "all day" appear in Patrick's eyes] Ice cream all day. All day. All day. All day.
Patrick: Ice cream all day? [the two employees look at Patrick and run off, screaming] I'm getting a job at Goofy Goober!
[The next few scenes is a tutorial video for beginners who want to work at Goofy Goober's.]
Video announcer: Goofy Goober's and you.
Training announcer: Hello, and welcome! As a new Goofy Goober employee, we'd like you to know that we appreciate you. [the screen shows Bikini Bottom in the 1800s] The story of our ice cream begins with our founder, Reginald Goober. [a picture of Reginald Goober is shown] Who for some unexplained reason was nicknamed Goofy. [the screen shows Reginald Goober and his ice cream wagon] In 1842, he headed West in a covered ice cream wagon. In the days before cones and refrigeration, [the screen shows ice cream being served on sticks and rocks] he served warm ice cream on rocks and sticks. [the screen shows Goofy Goober's as of now] From those humble beginnings, Goofy Goober has grown into a multibillion dollar business [the screen shows the Goofy Goober's outfit] that you, our newest employee, now have the privilege to work for. [the screen shows an employee washing his hands and spraying perfume in his mouth] We only ask that you, one, practice good hygiene, [the screen shows an employee wiping the table] two, maintain good work habits, [the screen shows a banana split UFO flying around] and three, believe in extraterrestrials.
Reginald Goober: [enters the UFO] Peace, hugs, and ice cream! [flies away in the UFO]
Video announcer: [laughs] The end.
[The screen pans out, revealing that Patrick slept through the whole tutorial video. The Goofy Goober's manager turns off the television.]
Goofy Goober manager: Hello, Goofy newbie.
Patrick: [yelps as he suddenly wakes up] Can I have my ice cream now?
Goofy Goober manager: Not until your first break. [chuckles] I'm your manager and I want you to know that I appreciate you. Now let's get you started. [leads Patrick to the sink] You will be washing dishes today. [gives Patrick dishwashing detergent] What do you think of that?
Patrick: Oh, I had a thought once. [his head fuzzes]
Goofy Goober manager: [chuckles] Ooh, you sure put the Goofy in Goober! I'll check on you in a few minutes. [leaves]
[Patrick picks up a dirty bowl and sniffs it. He then gets an idea. The screen shows the time card, "a few minutes later..." The Goofy Goober comes back in and sees all of the dishes done. Patrick is playing with the dishwashing detergent.]
Goofy Goober manager: Exceptional! Show me how you cleaned all these dishes so fast.
Patrick: Okay! [takes a bowl, puts it in his mouth and swooshes around; then he takes it out again]
[The manager is shocked at what Patrick did and his eyes become bloodshot.]
Goofy Goober manager: [takes the bowl] Never tell anyone you did that.
Patrick: [spits out a spoon] Is it time for my first break?
Goofy Goober manager: Not yet.
Patrick: Aww! [squeezes the dishwashing detergent bottle]
[The scene changes to the freezer.]
Goofy Goober manager: This should be easy. [clears throat as Patrick shivers] Just unload the boxes of ice cream from the truck, and stack them in the freezer. Okay, repeat it back to me.
Patrick: [shakily] When the bell rings, I peel a banana and run like the devil.
Goofy Goober manager: [confused] Uh. Eh, close enough. [leaves]
[The screen shows the time card, "one hour later..." Patrick is standing outside the freezer, but the thermostat is turn up way too high, melting all the ice cream inside.]
Goofy Goober manager: [comes back] Ooh, good, good! The truck is empty. [touches the door knob but it burns his hand; he yelps in pain] That's hot! [takes out a towel, opens the door and melted ice cream flows out, flooding the entire ice cream parlor.]
[Patrick is seen fishing on a raft, pulling off a reference to Tom Sawyer.]
Patrick: Nothing's biting today.
Goofy Goober manager: Newbie, why would you turn the heat on in the freezer?
Patrick: Oh, it was freezing in there, and the fire I built wasn't doing it.
Goofy Goober manager: What?! [sinks into the melted ice cream]
[The scene changes to Patrick dressed in a Goofy Goober suit.]
Goofy Goober manager: Now, this should be easy for you. You just walk around as Goofy the Goober and wave to the kids. But a warning—Sometimes the kids get a little over-affectionate.
[A little girl is hugging Patrick's leg. Patrick quivers in fear.]
Little girl #1: I love you, Goofy Goober!
Goofy Goober manager: [laughs] So cute. Good luck! [leaves]
Little boy: [jumps on Patrick's suit] I want you to be my daddy!
Little girl #2: [jumps on Patrick's suit with a nutcracker] I want to crack this nut! [squeezes Patrick's suit with the nutcracker]
[Patrick shakes the little girl with the nutcracker off. The little girl is sent flying into a carton of ice cream.]
Patrick: Sorry.
[The little girl comes out with a big blob of ice cream and happily runs around. The other kids join her as they follow her and run around. Patrick notices that their ice cream is unguarded.]
Patrick: Oh. Unattended ice cream. [opens his suit and sucks up some ice cream with the vacuum] Mustn't let it go to waste.
[Patrick sucks up all of the ice cream from the bowls. The manager shows up and is not impressed with Patrick's behavior. He turns the vacuum off. He opens Patrick's suit and sees tons of ice cream in it. He takes out some ice cream from Patrick's mouth.]
Goofy Goober manager: I think you better go home and clean up.
Patrick: [whinny] But I haven't had my first ice cream break!
Goofy Goober manager: I'll give you another chance tomorrow. If it doesn't work out, I'm afraid you're fired...[clears throat] in a most appreciative way.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sitting on Patrick's rock, playing his nose like a flute. Just then, Patrick comes by and feels very depressed.]
Patrick: [Stupidly not recognizing SpongeBob and tries to walk away]Oh, sorry, mister. I thought this was my rock.
SpongeBob: [slides down and laughs] Patrick, this is your rock. I was waiting for you. How was your first day at work?
Patrick: Oh, I can't do anything right. I'll probably get fired tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Oh, you poor little sea star. Tell you what, buddy—Tomorrow, I'll come with you to work and help out.
Patrick: [Stupidly]Oh, thanks, kind stranger!
[The scene changes back to Goofy Goober's the following day.]
Patrick: Okay, tell me for the gajillionth time, how is this gonna work?
SpongeBob: I'll show you. [climbs into Patrick's uniform] If you put arm arms behind you, I can be your hands.
Patrick: Ooh, so when I scoop ice cream—
SpongeBob: I'll do the scoopin'.
Patrick: And when I give change—
SpongeBob: [throws out money] I'll do the countin'.
Patrick: And when my butt itches—
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'm not doing that.
[The scene changes back inside Goofy Goober's.]
Goofy Goober manager: Okay, ready for your second, and last chance? [gets a bit suspicious as he nearly notices SpongeBob in Patrick's uniform; but chuckles] Let me show you how to make—
Patrick: Ice cream sandwiches? [SpongeBob's arms wave out of his uniform] I think I got this.
[SpongeBob makes a tower of ice cream sandwiches and puts a flag on top. A little eskimo comes out of the ice cream sandwich tower.]
Patrick: Time for my first break?
Goofy Goober manager: Oh, no, no, no. Not yet, not yet. [chuckles] But I think you're ready for the big time. [cuts to Patrick at the counter] All right, kid. Relax, don't choke, and try to have fun. [leaves]
Patrick: Easy, queasy, lemon squeezy.
[SpongeBob makes a perfect banana split.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! [puts a cherry on top]
Patrick: Work is hard work. [falls asleep]

[SpongeBob makes random ice cream dishes for the children. He makes a sundae with a graham cracker windmill, impressing the children. Then he puts sprinkles on them. Then he juggles some of the ice cream toppings and ingredients. Then he takes a blob of vanilla ice cream and morphs it into a puppet.]
SpongeBob: [plays with the ice cream puppet] Hello, folks! I'm Edible Edie! Start with my head!

[The children laugh and cheer at SpongeBob's outstanding performances. SpongeBob drives out of the counter in an ice cream boatmobile.]
Goofy Goober manager: [laughs] Great job, newbie. Now you can take your first break.
Patrick: My break? I can eat ice cream now?
Goofy Goober manager: All you can handle.
[Patrick drives out of Goofy Goobers in the ice cream boatmobile. He abruptly stops it outside, causing SpongeBob and Patrick to fall out and land on the ground.]
Patrick: Thanks for your help, buddy. Now, let's dig in.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'd love to. [his watch beeps] But if I don't hurry, I'll be late for my job. Sure you can handle that ice cream all...[pauses] by yourself? [sees Patrick eating the entire ice cream boatmobile] Silly question. [Patrick eats an ice cream sandwich and burps] Good luck, my employed pal. [leaves for the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: [looks at his drawn watch] Oh! Only two more minutes for my break! And two more minutes for ice cream!
[Patrick reenters Goofy Goober's and eats all the ice cream at the counter. Then he eats the soft served ice cream from the ice cream machine.]
Kids: [chanting] Chug, chug, chug, chug!
[Patrick is all chubby and fat from eating all that soft serve ice cream. Then he hops around, knocking over some bowls and ice cream cups. He lands in the center of Goofy Goober, takes a deep breath and sucks up all the ice cream. But something happens. After eating all that ice cream, his body begins to shiver.]
Patrick: Brain freeze!
[Patrick's body becomes covered in ice and the ice freezes up Goofy Goober's, Bikini Bottom, Bikini Atoll, and the entire world.]
French narrator: (Robotic speak) Five billion years later...
[After five billion years into the future, everything is thawed out.]
Patrick: [sees himself thawed out] I think that went well!
Goofy Goober manager: [gets real angry and breaks out of the ice] You are fired! [breathes heavily as children happily run past him]
Patrick: That's okay! I'm lactose intolerant anyways. [chuckles] A little— [exits Goofy Goober's and climbs into a banana split UFO just like Reginald Goober did] Peace, hugs, and ice cream! [flies off in the UFO]


[The episode begins at a spooky haunted house. A scared woman frantically runs from an old lady ghost. She goes to hide in a room and locks the door. However, the ghost floats through the door and corners her inside.]
Unnamed woman: Grandma! No! [screams as the ghost engulfs around her]
[The screen pans out to reveal it is just a scary horror movie Plankton is watching from Karen's monitor.]
Plankton: [laughs] Get her, Grandma! [laughs as he gets covered in the blanket] I'm the ghost of Plankton! Wooo! [trips over the sofa's armrest, removes his blanket and a lightbulb lights up above him] Hey, that gives me an idea. [hops onto Karen and changes the screen to make the blueprint of his plan] Hmm, if I were a ghost, I could walk right through the walls of the Krusty Krab and take the Krabby Patty secret formula! [giggles]
Karen: [turns the lights on and shakes the blueprint screen off] Ah! All right, that's it! You ruined another movie night with your secret formula garbage. [drops Plankton] I'm pulling the plug. [pulls the plug and shuts herself off]
Plankton: [groans as he stand up; waves his hand in anger] Ah. Let's see. Now all I need to do is invent a... [pulls a red curtain for a few seconds and pulls it back to reveal a skull-shaped machine] Ghost extracting machine! [laughs as he turns on the machine and hops in]
[Two robot arms come down with a squeezer tube people use for icing bags. They put it on Plankton's head then roll him up like a tube of toothpaste. Out of the squeezer is a green substance. It floats up and morphs into Plankton. Plankton has now become a ghost.]
Plankton: [looks at his dead body and whistles] I look like I just saw a ghost. [flies through the Chum Bucket doors and laughs] Success! [floats over to the Krusty Krab, flies through the front doors, and happily goes into the safe in Mr. Krabs' office] You gotta give up the ghost if you wanna make toast. [tries to pick up the secret formula, but fails] What?! [tries it numerous times, but also fail] No, no, no! Stupid ghost hands! [sobs frantically at his unsuccessful attempt until he hears laughing outside] What? [comes out of the safe and sees the Flying Dutchman laughing hysterically] What's so funny? Stupid ghost!
Flying Dutchman: You are, that's what. You can't just float in on your first day and pick things up. [laughs as he shrinks smaller; then he floats into the safe and picks up the bottle] Here you go. [the bottle floats through Plankton] Oh, grab it. [taunts Plankton with the bottle] Grab it! Get it! [laughs]
Plankton: I can't grab it! [wheezes]
Flying Dutchman: I like you, squirt. I got a soft spot in me heart of thieves [opens his chest, pokes a hole in his old heart and it deflates] I can teach you how to pick things up.
Plankton: [squeals happily] I love you.
Flying Dutchman: But first, you need to learn the "basics" of being a ghost.
[Plankton and the Flying Dutchman share a good laugh. The Flying Dutchman magically makes a gong appear and rings it onto Plankton.]
Flying Dutchman: First lesson... Shape-shifting. [cuts to behind the Krusty Krab] Shape-shifting is one of the easiest things a ghost can do. You just have to think of a horrible thing and poof! [changes into a monster, a walrus, a rattlesnake, a bat, and a Pearl look-alike; then he talks in Pearl's voice] You become it!
[Plankton screams in terror at the Flying Dutchman's shape-shifting abilities.]
Flying Dutchman: [changes back] Now, you try.
[Plankton gives his shape-shifting ability a try. However, he turns into an odd-looking shape.]
Plankton: I did it!
Flying Dutchman: [facepalms in annoyance] That's not horrible! What were you thinking?! [takes out a sprayer and sprays Plankton] Bad ghost! Bad!
[Plankton coughs and changes into an exact copy of the Flying Dutchman, but with one eye.]
Flying Dutchman: Hmm. Now, that's horrible!
Plankton: Now, can you teach me how to pick things up?
Flying Dutchman: Not yet. [snaps his fingers as a mallet appears and whacks Plankton on the head] Next lesson, scaring. [cuts to a dark alley] Pay close attention, squirt. This is how you scare someone.
[A robber runs down the alley with a bag of money. He hears some scary noises from behind and becomes scared. Just as he turns around, the Flying Dutchman lets out a devastating roar and makes a horrifying face. The robber screams in fright as he clothes, skin, muscles, and skeleton fall apart, leaving only his brain, eyes, nervous system, and stomach. Then he turns around and runs away.]
Plankton: Okay, my turn! [gives the Flying Dutchman a friendly punch in the stomach] Shh. Someone's coming. [floats toward a mirror] Watch me scare this dummy real good.
[Plankton turns around and makes a scary face while roaring real loud. But it turns out that he's scaring his own reflection. He screams in terror as his ghost skin splits apart, leaving his ghost skeleton and ghost eye. He floats behind the Flying Dutchman.]
Flying Dutchman: Well, you scared yourself. I guess that counts. [takes out a golf club] Next lesson. [hits Plankton's ghost skeleton and ghost eye back into his ghost body] Haunting houses. [cuts to Squidward's house as thunder roars in background and Squidward is sleeping in his bed] All right, pupil, it's time to apply all you've learned and frighten this guy's legs off.
Plankton: With pleasure.
[Plankton floats into Squidward's bed and possesses it like a puppet. The bed turns green and the box spring turns into Plankton's head. Plankton's eye appears about Squidward. Plankton shakes the bed and chuckles evilly as Squidward begins to wake up.]
Squidward: [screams] Who's there? Ohh, is that you, SpongeBob? [gets up and gets drenched on by green ectoplasm]
[Squidward removes his blindfold and becomes freaked out by the ectoplasm. Suddenly, the box spring forms into a giant mouth and makes an evil laugh. Squidward becomes so scared that his skin turned white. He tries to escape, but Plankton pulled him under the covers. Squidward releases himself from the covers and hides in the drawers.]
Flying Dutchman: [writing down his clipboard] Oooh. Monster mouth with a bucket of ghost goo—very good marks. [chuckles] Nice haunt, swabby!
Squidward: [comes out of the drawer with his clarinet and pants heavily] Oh, what a terrible nightmare. Oh, thanks for being here, Clarry. You'll keep the monsters away. [inhales and blows horrible music out through his clarinet]
[Squidward's clarinet playing drives Plankton and the Flying Dutchman crazy. Plankton floats over to Squidward and grabs the clarinet.]
Plankton: Give me that!
Squidward: Clarry!
[Squidward and Plankton get into a tug-o-war with the clarinet. Plankton turns into a ghostly SpongeBob and scares Squidward. Squidward runs out of the drawers and gets hit in the head when he crashed into the ceiling. Squidward falls down to the floor and is knocked out unconscious. Plankton throws the clarinet away and changes back.]
Plankton: Hey, I picked something up! I can pick things up! [picks up a vase and drops it]
Flying Dutchman: Look at you. You skipped ahead to the last lesson! [pulls out a mallet]
Plankton: It's okay. You don't have to—[gets hit by the mallet]
Flying Dutchman: Last lesson! How to pick things up. [cuts to Plankton and the Flying Dutchman exiting Squidward's house] As you discovered, to pick things up, you gotta get [gets fired up] really angry!
Plankton: Why didn't you say that before in the first place, moron?!
Flying Dutchman: I have nothing left to teach you. [tips his hat and bows]
Plankton: Oh, yeah? [forms into a ghostly mallet and hits the Flying Dutchman in the head]
Flying Dutchman: [sniffs] My boy.
[Plankton laughs and re-enters the Krusty Krab to try to steal the formula again. He makes an evil laugh and warms himself up.]
Plankton: Oh, I'm really angry! Here we go! [floats into Mr. Krabs' office] Yup! [enlarges his hand and successfully grabs the bottle; he lets out a happy squeal and laughs; then he tries to take it out, but the bottle is too solid] Blasted bottle! It's always something! [the Flying Dutchman laughs] What?
Flying Dutchman: Guess you didn't think that one through all the way, did ya?
Plankton: Dead jerk. [floats away in anger as the Flying Dutchman laughs; he exits the Krusty Krab] Well, I'm calling it. This ghost racket is for the birds. I'm going back to my body where I belong. Hmph! [goes back to the Chum Bucket and sees the light lit inside] Huh? I don't remember leaving the lights on. [enters the Chum Bucket] Wha—huh?! [much to his shocking dismay, he sees a funeral of himself being held; he sees his dead body in a small coffin] Yeesh. You can't leave your own carcass alone for ten minutes in this town!
Karen: And now, if anyone has anything nice to say about Sheldon, this would be the time.
[Tom snickers silently, but a mourner behind tells him to be quiet.]
SpongeBob: [walks up to the alter in tears] Um, Plankton was small and...[sniffs] And green and loud! [cries hysterically]
Karen: [comforts SpongeBob as she and Patrick take him back to his seat] All right, come on. It's okay.
Plankton: Yeesh. This is the worst funeral of mine I've ever been to. [grins evilly] But watch these idiots scream when I get back into my body and jump out of that coffin.
Flying Dutchman: [laughs as he appears through the floor in his ship] Ya can't go back in your body now. You're dead, ya dodo!
Plankton: I'm not dead. I'm just a temporary ghost. My body is in suspended animation, that's all.
Flying Dutchman: [giggles as he floats over to Plankton's dead body] You mean, this is an empty vessel? I haven't possessed a body in years!
Plankton: You can't do that! That's my body!
Flying Dutchman: Not anymore! [floats into Plankton's dead body and opens his eye; he sits himself up] Rarg! I'm alive! It's great to be back!
[All the mourners who attended Plankton's funeral gasp in a horrified surprise.]
Plankton: No!
Flying Dutchman: [jumps off the table and dances around on the floor] Ta-da!
SpongeBob: [sniffles as he cries a coffin full of tears; he stops crying] Plankton's alive? Hooray!
Karen: [angrily closes the coffin on SpongeBob] I knew it!
Incidental 67: He's alive?!
[All of the mourners get really angry. They assume that Plankton had been playing a cruel joke on them by pretending to be dead.]
Old Man Jenkins: Let's squash him!
[All the mourners gather around the Flying Dutchman in Plankton's body and prepare to attack him as payback for supposedly tricking them.]
Flying Dutchman: [continues dancing around] ♪Dee, dee, dee, dee, da, da, dee, dee, dee, da!♪ [stops dancing as he sees an angry mob around him] Wuh-oh. [screams in an attempt to scare them; but fails] Eh? Reowr? [the angry mob starts crushing him with their feet]
Plankton: Oh! I can't watch them do that to me!
Flying Dutchman: [escapes the angry mob and removes Plankton's dead body] Here! Take it! [gives Plankton his dead body] Those people are angry. Whew! I never thought I'd say this, but I'd rather be a dead me than an alive you. Bye! [disappears]
Plankton: [reenters his dead body and checks to see if everything is fitted; he sighs in relief] My body feels great!
What Zit Tooya: There he is!
[The angry mob gather around Plankton with angry looks on their faces.]
Plankton: [whimpers and laughs] Hey, everybody. [laughs nervously] Uh, who wants to hear a ghost story, huh? [laughs] Anyone? [gets stomped on by the angry mob] You know something? [gets stomped on] Ooh! It's great to be alive. [gets stomped on] Ouch! [gets stomped on] Ha, ha!
Flying Dutchman: The end! [makes a scary face while turning his head and laughs evilly as the episode ends]


[At boating school, SpongeBob is doing a boating test.]
Mrs. Puff: [she reads off her clipboard] Now, SpongeBob, what is the proper procedure for making a right turn?
SpongeBob: [thinks] Hold on, I'll check the textbook. [gets the textbook] Ah, "Your Mirror and You." Hmm, proper seat belt hygiene? No. [he continues to look at the textbook as Mrs. Puff puts on a helmet]
Mrs. Puff: Assuming crash position.
[Mrs. Puff screams as the boat is about to hit a wall. SpongeBob turns the boat quick enough so it doesn't crash. The boat is still out of control, and the two continue screaming. He puts his tongue on the breaks and stops the boat before it hits the lighthouse.]
Mrs. Puff: [relieved] We didn't crash!
SpongeBob: [happy] Hooray!
[The boat goes a little forward and hits the platform of the lighthouse. The two are scared as everything in it falls out. SpongeBob comes out of the rubble but Mrs. Puff doesn't.]
SpongeBob: [worried and calls out] Mrs. Puff! Oh, there you are. [pulls Mrs. Puff out of the rubble but she ends up on him. He gets out from under her bottom] I'll make it up to you, Mrs. Puff. I'll shine your shoes! [takes out his tongue and starts shining them with it] Dry your hair! [combs her hair and then becomes a hairdryer to dry her hairs, only for them to get crumpled. She gets angry] Oil your boat? [has a very worried expression as he's putting the oil. Some of it gets onto Mrs. Puff, to her dismay.]
Mrs. Puff: [as she's blocking out the oil] SpongeBob, stop it! ENOUGH! [pants heavily and gets the oil off herself] Well, you could clean up all this junk. I've been tossing stuff in this old lighthouse for 20 years!
SpongeBob: [gets excited and hugs Mrs. Puff] I love cleaning!
Mrs. Puff: [pushes SpongeBob a little bit away from her] Uh-huh, glad to hear it. I'll be in my classroom. [goes into the boating school. She comes outside again to tell SpongeBob something] Oh, and if you need me... [her smile turns into a frown] ...don't. [shuts the door]
[Mrs. Puff is about to meditate and turns on the music. Quickly afterwards, the meditation music becomes rock music and Mrs. Puff starts rocking. Scene changes to SpongeBob in a bathing suit, diving into the pile of stuff. He makes his way through until he finally reaches the lighthouse. He makes a couple of dolphin noises after coming out and then takes out the stuff that got in his body. He takes off his bathing hat and blows it so he can make several boxes out of it. He happily goes back to cleaning and eats the remainder of the stuff. After filling himself with stuff, he shoots everything into several boxes and then puts those boxes inside a small box.]
SpongeBob: [sighs in relief] That takes care of that. [leans to the side of the stairs, only to slip due to them being covered with dust. He rubs his finger on the dust, and it coughs on him] Yuck. This place needs a good scrub.
[Scene changes to SpongeBob with some cleaning supplies. He pours the water in the bucket on himself and absorbs it. He then puts his head on the floor and starts cleaning it. After cleaning the floor, he cleans the stairs in a short amount of time. He is now at the top of the stairs.]
SpongeBob: Ah, almost done. I just need to shine out that old lighthouse's lantern. [He hears some weird sounds, and gets terrified by them] The lighthouse is haunted! Just like my toaster.
[A toaster is seen swinging around SpongeBob's kitchen while making scary noises. The toast comes out of the toaster, in the shape of a ghost.]
SpongeBob: [opens the door, only for there to be nothing inside. After making a sigh of relief, a box falls down and starts moving, scaring him] That box is haunted! [He falls down the stairs and gets hurt several times as he's going down] These stairs are haunted! [SpongeBob lands on the small box, causing all the big boxes as well as all the stuff packed in them to spill all over the lighthouse again] This trash is haunted. [the box creeps towards him, and he panics while backing away]
Louie: [comes out of the box] Meow.
SpongeBob: [still scared] Ahh! Ghost snail! [he cowers and cries a little]
Louie: [goes next to SpongeBob and soothes him] Meow.
SpongeBob: [becomes happy] Oh, you're no ghost. Just a cute little stray snail. How about I call you Louie? Lighthouse Louie! [giggles]
Louie: [accepting his name to be Louie] Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: [as he's putting down Louie] Now, Louie, you'll be good while uncle SpongeBob cleans. [attempts to pick up a box]
Louie: [goes to SpongeBob] Meow, meow. [SpongeBob trips on him. After he lands on the floor, he goes over him, while covering him with slime] Meow.
SpongeBob: [gets up and takes Louie outside the lighthouse] Louie, I'm afraid you'll have to play out here, little fella. For your own safety. [goes back inside and shuts the door, while sighing in relief. Several objects get thrown from inside the box, the thrower being Louie] What! Louie? [scene changes to him tying Louie onto the boat so he won't bother him] Well, that oughta keep you out of my HAIR!
Louie: [seen in the lighthouse, having already escaped] Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Louie, you have to stay outside. [attempts to throw Louie outside, but ends up getting thrown outside himself, with the part of the car Louie was tied to being thrown onto him as well] No silly little snail is a match for my superior sponge brain! [shows his brain, doing a small dance until the wind ends up knocking it down from its position] [scene changes to him bringing out a Krabby Patty in a Can, while giggling. He opens the can with his teeth and puts it on a plate] And the bait: one can-o-patty. [SpongeBob ties a rope onto a stick holding a box above the can-o-patty, and hides behind the stuff.]
Louie: [notices the Krabby Patty] Meow! [goes under the box and licks it several times]
SpongeBob: [pulls the string] Gotcha! [the box goes down and traps Louie. He opens the box, but the snail is gone] I don't gotcha. [realizes Louie put a bigger box on top of the small box. The snail pulls the string for the larger box, causing him to get trapped] You got me. [pulls up his nose to turn on his light, and tries to get out of the box, only to break his arms] Barnacles, that's heavy. Huh? [sees the Krabby Patty in a Can is still inside and uses his feet to grab it. He eats the small portion of it that was left, allowing him to become extremely strong, enough to get outside the box with ease. He realizes Louie isn't there] Huh, where'd Louie go? [his arms let out air and become weak again. He is now at the top of the lighthouse, calling out for Louie] Louie! Louie! Louie!
Louie: [on top of lantern] Meow.
SpongeBob: [relieved to finally see Louie] Louie! So this is where you've been hiding? [Louie shrieks at him, making him gulp and become scared] Nice snail, good Louie! [backs up] No, no... [screams]
[Louie jumps on him, and they go all over the top of the lighthouse. They hit the wall, and when they come off, SpongeBob accidentally flicks the button to turn on the lighthouse's lantern. It shines on a place called Protein Fiend, where it reflects SpongeBob and Louie fighting on one of its walls.]
Larry: [amazed by the reflection] Woah, those dudes are huge! I wonder what they lift. [hits Bubble Bass slightly with his elbow]
Bubble Bass: [notices the reflection and drops his drink in fear] Those aren't dudes. They're giant monsters! Everybody panic! [the three start panicking and run around in circles]
[Louie is biting SpongeBob, and their ruckus causes the lighthouse to start rocking. At the same time, Mrs. Puff is still listening and rocking to the rock music, unaware of what's going on outside. The lighthouse tips over and rolls out of the boating school. Larry, Bubble Bass, and the small fish are still panicking until they see that the reflection is gone.]
Larry: [happy] Those buff monsters have vanished! [hugs the other two] We're saved! [he and the other two hear some noise, and realize the lighthouse is coming their way]
Bubble Bass: We're doomed! [he gets out his drink and starts walking across the sidewalk away from the lighthouse, while the other two runoff in a different direction. The lighthouse runs over him, causing him to get submerged into the sidewalk with his posterior sticking out] My cheeks!
[Bikini Bottom News plays, showing Perch Perkins having an interview with Fred about the lighthouse.]
Perch Perkins: Can you please tell our viewers the cause of this destruction?
Fred: [frightened] It was a lighthouse. It rolled through town, destroying everything in its path! [pants] A LIGHTHOUSE! [goes on his knees and starts crying]
Perchy Perkins: [shocked] My goodness. Were you or YOUR LEGS injured by this insane lighthouse?
Fred: [sad and kicks a rock] No.
[The lighthouse is now rolling towards the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [shrieks as he watches the lighthouse on TV rolling towards his restaurant] That blasted lighthouse is gonna demolish me Krusty Krab! [speaks to his customers] Attention loyal customers!
Paco: Run for our lives?
Mr. Krabs: No, throw your bodies in front of that lighthouse, and protect me restaurant! [some rumbling occurs]
[All the customers run out of the Krusty Krab, while Louie is still attempting to bite SpongeBob as they're on the lighthouse.]
SpongeBob: [realizes they're heading for the Krusty Krab] No, not the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the restaurant, brave] Stay away from me restaurant, you dirty... er... lighthouse! [the lighthouse continues rolling his way. He hides in his shell, now scared]
SpongeBob: [having trouble speaking] Must... stop... lighthouse. [jumps and turns around, causing his shoes to burn when he lands and the lighthouse to stop before it crashes into the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his shell] Ha-ha, and don't come back! [laughs some more as the lighthouse is moving away]
[Louie smashes onto SpongeBob, causing the lighthouse to turn back around and crash into the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs is going inside it.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the rubble, severely damaged] Oh, you came back. [his arms and eyes fall out of his body]
[The lighthouse rolls towards the boating school and hits a rock causing it to fly into the air. It lands on a boat, which drives onto the original placement of the lighthouse before the boat gets destroyed by it. At the same time, Mrs. Puff continues to listen to her rock music, still unaware of what's going on in her surroundings. All the boxes of stuff land on the floor in towers, all organized. Meanwhile, a scared SpongeBob is on the lighthouse's lantern, and gets off of it to search for Louie.]
SpongeBob: [worried] Louie? Where's Louie? [he hears some meowing, and when he opens the lantern's door, he realizes Louie gave birth to several baby snails] Aw, Louie, you weren't trying to stop me from cleaning! [pats one of the baby snails] You were just protecting your cute little babies. [the baby snails meow in unison] I guess I should call you Louise instead! [laughs]
[SpongeBob brings Mrs. Puff inside the lighthouse.]
Mrs. Puff: [shocked and amazed] You actually did a good job, SpongeBob! You deserve a gold star! [puts a star on his forehead]
SpongeBob: [excited] Ohh, a gold star! I have a present for you, too, Mrs. Puff. [gives her a box with Louie and her baby snails] These little cuties were hiding in your lighthouse.
Mrs. Puff: [in awe, chuckles] Aren't you adorable?
SpongeBob: [blushes] Oh, Mrs. Puff, you're pretty cute, too!
[Mrs. Puff frowns at this statement. The two go outside the lighthouse towards the entrance at the school, where SpongeBob leaves the school.]
SpongeBob: [happy] See you next week, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: [relieved] Amazing. For once, SpongeBob didn't create a huge disaster! [hears the angry mob]
Mr. Krabs: [angry along with the others in the mob] Puff! Your blasted lighthouse destroyed the whole town! [becomes sad] And me restaurant!
Mrs. Puff: [shocked] My lighthouse?!
The entire mob: What are you going to do about it?!
Mrs. Puff: [puts on her headphones, turns on her radio, and starts rocking again] Talk to the fin! [The snails come out of the box, and rock with her as well.]


[The episode begins at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff are getting ready for a camping trip in the kelp forest.]
Mrs. Puff: [laughs while reading a camping brochure] We are going to have so much fun! A weekend in a cabin in the woods with the Gal Pals!
Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff: Gal Pals! Yeah!
[Mrs. Puff takes out a Krabby Patty and goes to eat it.]
Karen: [takes the Krabby Patty from Mrs. Puff] Oh, a Krabby Patty! [squeezes its juice in the boatmobile's engine] Perfect.
Mrs. Puff: [grossed out] Ugh.
Karen: The engine needed greasing. [closes the boatmobile's hood]
Sandy: [lassos the trailer towards her] Congratulations, Mrs. Puff! [hooks the trailer on the boatmobile] Your boat and trailer just got hitched! [puts a bride tiara and groom hot on both the boatmobile and trailer, throws some confetti and shares a good laugh with Karen and Mrs. Puff]
Mrs. Puff: [checks her watch] Hmm, I wonder what's keeping our newest Gal Pal?
[Meanwhile, the newest member of the Gal Pals, Pearl Krabs, is skipping down the road with her backpack.]
Pearl: This is gonna be so funny. The Gal Pals will obviously try to prank the newbie, but this newbie is gonna prank them right back. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [pops out of Pearl's backpack] Boo! Who likes eggs? [laughs]
Pearl: Not now, SpongeBob. [stuffs SpongeBob back in her backpack] Wait until you're around the campfire. And you're supposed to act scary, not lame.
SpongeBob: Oh, scary. Got it! Wait until the fire then make with the scary. [makes goofy faces and weird noises]
Pearl: [pushes SpongeBob in her backpack] Keep working on it. [meets up with Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff]
Sandy: Here comes our newest member!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Gal Pals! Yeah!
[The four girls share a good laugh.]
Sandy: Here, let me get your bag. [takes Pearl's backpack and throws it in the trailer]
[The girls stuff the trailer with many camping supplies: tents, sleeping bags, sporting equipment, lanterns, pillows, extra blankets, umbrellas, food, a grill, swimwear, and suitcases with extra clothing. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out through all those camping supplies just as the trailer door closed.]
SpongeBob: Nice and cozy.
[The girls climb in the boatmobile and begin driving away to the kelp forest.]
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: ♪We're Gal Pals and, yes, we shall conquer the world one day! We're no sea bunnies, we're smart and funny and we demand equal pay! We'll shout "Gal Pals" right into your ear canal and bang it on a drum! We're sweet and nice, but take our advice cross us and you'll be chum!♪
[The girls' singing comes to an abrupt halt when they see a moose snail in the middle of the road. They let the moose snail cross and drive away while sharing another good laugh.]
Mrs. Puff: Ooh, this is gonna be so much fun! We're gonna have a real adventure with our newbie, aren't we, ladies?
[Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff snicker quietly together. Pearl makes a nervous laugh and share another good laugh with the others. Pearl quietly snickers to herself for the prank she planned on her own. Suddenly, the trailer hits a bump and gets unhooked by the boatmobile. The trailer skidded off the road and rolls down into a ditch filled with mud. SpongeBob, feeling sick, climbs out of the trailer, slips on the mud, and gets a bit messy. He wrings the mud off him.]
SpongeBob: Where am I? [climbs out of the mud pit and finds himself in the kelp forest] Huh? All right, I'll just sit tight and wait to hear from Pearl. I've got the trailer, so there's plenty of food and blankets. [the trailer full of camping supplies sink in the mud; he growls and kicks a pebble] Barnacles! Now what am I gonna do? [sticks his hands in his pockets and finds a peanut] Hey, a peanut! A lucky peanut! Mm, I'm not gonna go hungry out here. I'm gonna survive! [his voice echoes] Wait a minute, I can't eat this peanut. You're my lucky peanut. [giggles] I've got a lucky peanut! [his voice echoes again]
[Meanwhile, the girls made it to the cabin they rented for their camping trip.]
Mrs. Puff: Here we are.
Sandy: [notices the trailer is gone] Uh-oh, looks like we lost something.
Pearl: [gasps] Oh, no, my backpack! This is the worst thing that could ever happen! [cries a river of tears]
Karen: [comforts Pearl] Aww, there, there, sweetie. It's just a backpack. We can buy you a new one. It's not like losing a friend.
Pearl: [stops crying and whimpers] She must be psychic. [resumes crying]
Sandy: Aww, heck, we'll just have to rough it! [opens the door and sees the cabin a complete mess; there are bones, algae, toadstools, cobwebs, a wolfworm who steals a bone and runs off, and the floor and ceiling are decaying] All right, gals, let's not just hang here like mama's washing! Time to gussy up the place!
[The scene changes to the cabin looking good as new. It now has a radio with stereo equipment, new wallpaper, a lamp, some beanbag chairs, a sofa, a dining table with chairs, a chandelier, some new windows, and a refrigerator filled with many kinds of food.]
Karen: Good thing we have a Texas tornado among the Gal Pals. Who knew you could use a jellyfish as a recharger. [grabs a jellyfish and recharges herself with its stingers] Oh, yeah. [sighs and faints]
Sandy: Yep, nature always provides.
Mrs. Puff: [sets a cornucopia with food in it on the table] Hey, where's the newbie?
[Pearl is outside the cabin trying to contact with SpongeBob on her cellphone.]
Pearl: Oh...Oh, please, SpongeBob, be all right. [dials the number on her cellphone]
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is exploring the kelp forest by swinging on vines like a jungle man.]
SpongeBob: [making goofy jungle noises while swinging] I'm Sponge-zan of the brine apes! [swings on several vines, crashes into a tree, and falls in a bush; then he hears ringing sounds and takes out the peanut] Oh, my lucky peanut's ringing. [pulls a human ear out of his head] Hello? [hears ringing in his other pocket, takes out a shellphone and answers it] Shell-lo? [laughs]
Pearl: SpongeBob! Oh, thank Neptune, you're still alive.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Pearl, I'm still gonna do the prank. I just have to find your cabin. Are there any landmarks I can head to?
Pearl: Uh, well, there are a lot of trees.
SpongeBob: Trees, perfect! I'll just follow the trees. [hangs up the shellphone] Are you sure you didn't ring, too, lucky peanut? Hello, hello? Ugh, bad reception. No peanut bars. [the peanut shows connection bars on it; he puts it in his pocket and goes to follow the trees] Follow the trees! Follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees...
[As time passes, day turns to nighttime. The girls are sitting together around the campfire drinking kelp cocoa.]
Mrs. Puff: [slurps some kelp cocoa] Oh, this kelp cocoa is delicious.
Karen: [scans her kelp cocoa] Yeah, my sensors indicate an agreeable flavor. [dumps her kelp cocoa on the ground]
Sandy: [grabs a flashlight] Okay, Gal Pals, [turns it on and leans it to her helmet] it's time to initiate our newest member. [turns it off and puts a Gal Pal necklace on Pearl]
Mrs. Puff: You are now a Gal Pal.
Pearl: That's it? Just this necklace? No swats or parading around in my PJ's? No tryin' to scare me with urban legends?
Sandy: Why would we do that?
Karen: Yeah, we like you.
Mrs. Puff: We haven't had a forth member since that incident with Flibberty Gibbet. I—[gets her mouth shut by Sandy]
Sandy: Puff! Shh.
Pearl: Who's "Slippery Giveth"?
Sandy: Oh, Flibberty Gibbet. She was the fourth member of our group. We had a fight with her years ago right here at this very cabin one dark and stormy night. [thunder crashes in her eyes]
Mrs. Puff: We don't even remember what the fight was about.
[While Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff explain, their shadows tell every detail of the argument they had with Flibberty Gibbet.]
Sandy: It sure was a humdinger of an argument!
Karen: She went bananas and vowed to destroy any and all the Gal Pals. [the green line on her screen turns red]
Mrs. Puff: Then she just ran off into these woods!
Sandy: Some say she's still out there, all hot-headed and waiting to get her revenge. [hides in her suit]
Karen: That's her pendant you're wearing.
Pearl: [looks at the pendant and sees Flibberty Gibbet's name on it] "Flibberty Gibbet"?! [screams in fear, takes off the necklace and throws it away] Why did you give me that? Why did you take me here?! [Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff laugh; Pearl blushes and laughs as well] Thanks, gals, you got me. But I knew you were gonna prank me.
Karen: Sure you did.
Mrs. Puff: You should have seen your face.
Sandy: We got you good!
[While the girls are talking, a creepy hand comes out and takes the pendant.]
Pearl: [laughs] Mm, Gal Pals.
[All of a sudden, the girls hear scary sounds from within the trees. Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff huddle together in fear.]
Sandy: [gasps] What was that?
Pearl: 'Kay, you can stop trying to scare me. I know Flipperty Giblets is a prank.
Karen: Flibberty Gibbet is partly true.
Mrs. Puff: She was a Gal Pal. We did have a fight with her.
Sandy: And she did run off into these woods.
Pearl: Wait, that was all the parts!
[The scary sounds are getting louder. Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff quiver in fright.]
Mrs. Puff: Quick, let's hide in the cabin!
Pearl: Wait, it—it's okay. It's only SpongeBob. I asked him to make noise and prank you. All right, SpongeBob, you can come out! I'm canceling the prank!
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is still following the trees. But it turns out that he's only walking back and forth from one tree to the other.]
SpongeBob: [laughs quietly and touches a tree] There's another tree. [skids to the tree next to it] And another tree. Wow, following the trees really works. [touches the trees between him] Tree, tree, tree, tree.
[Back at the cabin, the girls are still sitting by the campfire.]
Mrs. Puff: So, SpongeBob thinks he can prank us, huh? We'll prank him right back. [begins to go insane] We can rig up the cabin with trap doors, flying ghosts, and a thousand cadavers in a zombie ballroom! [covers her mouth after realizing she's losing her composure] Ooh, what am I saying?
Sandy: Let's scale it down a smidge.
Karen: Yeah, let's hide behind this tree and scream when he shows up.
[The girls hide behind a nearby tree and giggle.]
Sandy: You coming, Pearl?
Pearl: Well, I'm certainly not staying by myself in the dark. [joins the girls in hiding behind the tree to prank SpongeBob]
Sandy: Shh, he's coming. Wait for it. Now!
[The girls jump out and make a loud, scary scream. However, it turns out that it was just a scary old lady, not SpongeBob. The old lady roars angrily.]
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Flibberty Gibbet! [scream as they run into the cabin and try to hold the door shut]
Mrs. Puff: It's her! Oh, s—she looks like she's been in the woods too long!
Sandy: I have a plan. We'll run out the back door and into Puff's boat. Count of three. One, two, three!
[The girls run from the door and scream. The old lady breaks through the front door and roars. The girls run out the back door and jump into the boatmobile.]
Karen: Let's go!
[Just then, SpongeBob jumps out and makes scary noises.]
SpongeBob: Rawr! Hmm? [shrugs and skips to the cabin's front door]
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: No, no! SpongeBob! Don't go in!
SpongeBob: [sees the girls] Oh, hello.
[The old lady grabs SpongeBob and drags him in the cabin. SpongeBob's screaming is heard from the inside. The girls scream in horror.]
Sandy: Gal Pals, we have to save SpongeBob!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: [whimpering] Gal Pals.
[The girls break through the front door to rescue SpongeBob. But, to their relief and surprise, the old lady turns out to be a sales lady giving SpongeBob pinecones on a stick.]
SpongeBob: Wow! [the old lady gives SpongeBob a pinecone on a stick] Ooh, another pinecone on a stick! I love it. [takes it and gets another one from the old lady] Wow! [takes another pinecone on a stick] I'm gonna get one of these for each of the Gal Pals.
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: [confused] Huh?
Sandy: [laughs in relief] It's only a cabin-to-cabin country sales lady. Not Flibberty Gibbet at all.
Flibberty Gibbet: [off-screen] Did someone say my name? [the girls turn and see her for real this time] Hi, gals!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Flibberty Gibbet! [scream as they run out of the cabin and into the woods]
Flibberty Gibbet: I—I just wanted to say all's forgiven!
SpongeBob: [follows the girls] Hey, wait! You'll need my lucky peanut!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Gal Pals! [crash onto the screen]
[The words "The End" is shown and the episode ends.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Tina Fran: Oh, these are delicious.
[Suddenly, a loud roar is heard and it shook the whole restaurant.]
Jennifer Millie: What was that?
Nathiel Waters: Think it came from Krabs' office. Maybe he's in trouble.
SpongeBob: [comes out of the kitchen] I'll save you, Mr. Krabs! [attempts to enter Mr. Krabs' office, but Mr. Krabs slams the door in SpongeBob's face; Mr. Krabs moans and groans as his stomach growls] Ooh, Mr. Krabs, thank Neptune you're okay. [Mr. Krabs' stomach growls really loud] Eww, what was that noise?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [turns his body around] Uh, I didn't hear nothing. Everything's completely normal. Okay, closing time! Everyone out! [pulls down a rope and makes the floor push SpongeBob, Squidward and the customers out; then he frantically locks the door as everyone looks at Mr. Krabs suspiciously] Eh..o-okay... [laughs nervously] See you tomorrow.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and I don't want to leave work early. Right, Squidward?
[Squidward happily runs away from the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I could still— [Mr. Krabs and everyone else is gone, leaving with only a nickel] A nickel? [licks the nickel] And it's the same temperature as Mr. Krabs. [picks up the nickel] Ooh, he's gonna want this back. [runs off]
[Mr. Krabs runs all over the streets of Bikini Bottom in a frantic panic. He hides behind the building and sees a taxi pulling over for a customer. He rolls over to the taxi and hides underneath it before it drives away. SpongeBob appears and fails to stop Mr. Krabs. He waves for another taxi.]
SpongeBob: Follow that boat! [crawls under the taxi before it drives away]
[The driver stops the taxi boat at a place that's located outside of Bikini Bottom, the Slop Pail. SpongeBob comes out from under the taxi and is completely beaten up.]
Taxi driver: Sorry about all those speed bumps, kid. And the cactus patch and the demolition derby.
SpongeBob: [dizzily] "Roast moblem, Orfficer." [pays the taxi driver and faints]
[Mr. Krabs is sitting at a picnic table, waiting impatiently for something. He checks his watch and frantically looks around. SpongeBob appears through the wood of the picnic table.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [shrieks as SpongeBob's appearance startles him] SpongeBob, what are you doing here, boy-o?
SpongeBob: [pulls himself out of the table] I brought your nickel, silly. [pauses and looks around] What is this place? And what are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, [takes the nickel] I've never been here before in my life.
[Just then, a man, who is the chef of the Slop Pail, appears and gives Mr. Krabs a bowl full of chum.]
Sal: Eugene, got your usual here: one big steaming plate of chum! Enjoy.
[The chum belches slime in SpongeBob's face.]
SpongeBob: "Usual?" "Chum?" "Enjoy?" Oh, I don't understand, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I suppose there's no hiding it, boy-o. It all started back in me old Navy days. [a flashback of Mr. Krabs' Navy days is shown] I was a young seaman on a dangerous mission deep in enemy territory.
[The flashback shows all of Mr. Krabs' Navy friends having a fun time at the beach. Mr. Krabs is sleeping in a hammock.]
Navy chef: [rings his triangle] Meal time.
[Mr. Krabs Navy friends run over the chef and climb onto the ship to eat their meals. Mr. Krabs continues to sleep in his hammock.]
Mr. Krabs: [voiceover] Somehow, in the madness of battle, I became separated from me crew. [his past self yawns and wakes up from his nap; he goes into the ship and sees everyone sleeping after eating too much] It took hours of fighting and sneaking and scraping to get back to me ship, but by the time I got there, our supplies have been decimated. [his past self sits in a chair and the chef feeds him chum] All we had left was chum...and I hadn't eaten since noon. [his past self starts to eat chum] I was starting to feel peckish. [his past self starts to take a liking to chum] But, oh, that flavor. Sweet and gamy with a cream, chunky mouthfeel. [a chum monkey appears as his past self continuously eats chum] Oh, I've had a chum monkey on my back ever since. [his chum monkey screeches before coming back to the present day] Been eating the stuff in secret for years now. [eats some of Sal's chum] Just got a taste for it. One of them survival things, I suppose. [a piece of Sal's chum gurgles for a bit before Mr. Krabs slurps it in his mouth] Oh, uh, look, SpongeBob, I don't want this getting out, you understand? [laughs] Especially to Plankton. So what do you say, huh? Keep me shame a secret, huh? For old Mr. Krabsy?
SpongeBob: [laughs] You got it, Mr. Krabs. My lips are sealed. [zips his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Glad to hear it. Okay, see you tomorrow. [pushes SpongeBob away] Sal, I'm feeling hungry tonight. How's about another plate of chum?
Sal: Oh, sorry, Eugene, that was my last plate of chum, ever! I'm closing the Slop Pail permanently. [closes his restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] What?! [gulps]
Sal: Yep, I'm moving to Shell City to make it big in the pictures. Just imagine this mug on a movie screen 30 feet wide! [a closeup of his face is shown while laughing] See you in the movies! [drives away]
Mr. Krabs: But where will I get me chum from?
[Mr. Krabs is now stranded in the middle of nowhere alone. The scene changes back to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is pacing back and forth about where he'll get more chum.]
SpongeBob: Gosh, Mr. Krabs, I've never tried to make chum before. I don't even know what the ingredients are.
Mr. Krabs: Ugh, well, uh, it's, uh—it's made from... [whispers in SpongeBob's ear about what the actual ingredients of chum are and from what SpongeBob hears, it is really disgusting]
SpongeBob: [gags and groans in disgust] Eww. [as Mr. Krabs is done talking, SpongeBob turns pale and his yellow color melts off; he mops up his color and washes himself with it] Um, I don't think I can make that for you, Mr. Krabs, but I can make you some chum-free chum. You won't even be able to tell the difference.
Mr. Krabs: I sure hope you're right.
French narrator: Later…
[The scene changes to SpongeBob serving three kinds of chum for Mr. Krabs to enjoy.]
SpongeBob: Behold: three takes on chum à la SpongeBob. [Mr. Krabs gives a taste on the first plate of chum] The secret ingredient in this one? Krabby Patties. Well? Huh?
Mr. Krabs: It's delicious! [suddenly gets angry] Too delicious! [swats the first plate of chum away] Next!
SpongeBob: [gives Mr. Krabs another plate full of chum and Mr. Krabs gives another taste] To capture the natural bouquet of the chum, I made this batch entirely from old snail litter.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps, spits out some snail litter and his face shrivels] A little dry. [shakes his head back to normal] Next! [swats the second plate of chum away]
SpongeBob: [gives Mr. Krabs another plate full of chum] Ooh, I think you'll like this one. [Mr. Krabs gives it a taste] I know I do. [giggles] It's made from wishes and love.
[Mr. Krabs belches out hearts and sparkles. His face turns into SpongeBob's face and laughs like SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [rubs his face back to normal] It's too sweet. Oh, none of these are right, SpongeBob. I think this old chum chewer needs some time alone. [leaves the Krusty Krab and sulks away]
[Later that night, Mr. Krabs stops at a brick wall and wails in sadness. His stomach moans and groans in hunger, giving Mr. Krabs so much pain.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, the Chum Bucket's the only place in town still selling chum, but I can't go crawling to Plankton for help. No, I won't. I got too much pride for that. [cuts to Mr. Krabs invading Plankton's trash can, looking for some chum] Oh, come on, there's gotta be some chum in here somewhere!
Karen: [comes out with a flashlight] Uh, hello? [Mr. Krabs hides behind the trash can] Who—who's out there?
Plankton: [comes out with a bat] All right, miscreant, come over here where I can destroy you! [swings the bat around, but gets crushed by it]
[Mr. Krabs attempts to escape, but Karen catches him.]
Karen and Plankton: Krabs?
Plankton: What are you doing here? [crawls out from under his bat]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, nothing! I, uh, [takes the shoe out of his mouth] lost my shoe! See? Found it. [laughs] Okay, bye. [his stomach growls loudly]
Plankton: [suspiciously] Hold it. What's going on with you, Krabs? Your clothes are a mess and your stomach's making strange noises.
Mr. Krabs: [wears the shoe] What are you talking—I'm...[stammers until he gives in] Oh, fine! [throws away the shoe] I'm hooked on chum, okay?!
Plankton: Say what?! [his skeleton falls out in shock]
Mr. Krabs: Look at me now! Digging through garbage for scraps! [sobs uncontrollably]
Plankton: [sucks his skeleton back in his body] You actually like chum?
Karen: How is that possible? Nobody likes chum! It tastes terrible!
Plankton: [hops on Karen's screen] Shh! Mute your speaker, Karen. This pathetic display is giving me an idea. [walks over to a sobbing Mr. Krabs] All right, Krabs, old buddy, how would you like a lifetime supply of chum?
Mr. Krabs: [stops crying] Really?
Plankton: Sure, for the low, low price of the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Mr. Krabs: [shrieks] No, no, I can't! Not me formula.
Plankton: You sure, Krabs? [holds up a bowl full of chum] Just breathe in that noxious smell. [sniffs the chum and nearly gags; lassos Mr. Krabs down with the chum fumes and holds up a chum-shaped pendulum] You know you want it. [laughs evilly as he attempts to brainwash Mr. Krabs]
[The chum monkey in Mr. Krabs' head sees and hears everything. He climbs into Mr. Krabs' brain and reactivates it with a steering wheel. Mr. Krabs crawls over towards Plankton and attempts to eat some of his chum.]
Plankton: [throws the chum out of sight] Ah-ah-ah. Not until I have the formula.
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Oh, fine! I'll be right back. [goes to his restaurant, enters his office and opens his safe, only to find SpongeBob sleeping and cuddling with the secret formula inside]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing here, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, when I can't sleep, I come here to be close to the formula. It comforts me.
Mr. Krabs: Well, comfort time's over now! [grabs the formula] I'm trading the formula to Plankton for a lifetime supply of chum.
SpongeBob: [stops Mr. Krabs in his tracks] I can't let you do that, Mr. Krabs. [tries to pull the formula out of Mr. Krabs' claws] You'll thank me for this later. [grunts as he tugs and pulls] Okay. [gets dragged on the floor by an annoyed Mr. Krabs] Gotta get a better grip. [enters the Chum Bucket while being dragged to the floor; he sighs] Okay, okay.
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, where are you? I got the formula! I'm here to collect me chum!
Plankton: [off-screen] I'm up here, Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [climbs up the ladder and sees a whole lifetime supply of chum in an enormous barrel] Whoo-hoo! Just look at all that chum! And it's all for me! [laughs maniacally]
Plankton: Oh, I'm so sorry, Krabs. You foiled too many of my plans over the years for me not to double-cross you now. [holds up a remote] This time, I have the upper hand! [pushes the button and activates a giant robot fist, which crushes Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob; the secret formula rolls over to Plankton and he picks it up] Get it? "Upper hand?" [laughs like crazy] I win and you get nothing!
[Mr. Krabs lifts the robot fist up and attacks Plankton. The two get into a massive brawl over the secret formula. But their fighting causes the secret formula to fall into the chum.]
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton: [gasps] No!
[The secret formula sinks into the chum. Mr. Krabs gasps in shock as he eyestalks become secret formula bottles before disappearing into dust.]
Plankton: [puts on some swimwear] You and SpongeBrain can see yourselves out, Krabs. Ta-ta! [laughs] Alley-oop! [jumps onto the chum to get the secret formula]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, this is terrible! Oh, my formula's gone! I'm ruined! And hungry! [cries]
SpongeBob: Wait, Mr. Krabs! Plankton is tiny. It'll take him forever to swim through that chum. [the chum bubbles] You can get to the formula before him, but you're gonna have to eat like the wind.
Mr. Krabs: You're right, boy-o! I can do this! [jumps into the barrel of chum]
SpongeBob: Whoo! [Mr. Krabs begins gobbling down on the lifetime supply of chum] Go, Mr. Krabs, go! Whoo! [Mr. Krabs eats some bread] No, don't fill up on bread! The chum! Eat the chum!
Mr. Krabs: [takes out a straw] Right! [slurps on the rest of the chum until he is completely obese and full]
[SpongeBob climbs down, opens the barrel's door, and enters the chum barrel. Mr. Krabs groans and belches out the secret formula.]
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, you did it! You saved the secret formula.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, and I think I killed me taste for chum too. See? [sticks out his tongue that has tombstones on his taste buds] I'll never touch another bite of this stuff as long as I live. [groans]
SpongeBob: Hey, where'd Plankton go?
Karen: [takes out an x-ray] Hold still. [pulls the x-ray down to reveal Plankton inside Mr. Krabs' stomach] This isn't the first time this has happened. [the x-ray shows Plankton struggling inside Mr. Krabs' stomach] Hmm, could take him a while to get out.
SpongeBob: What should we do while we wait?
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Karen, Mr. Krabs, and the chum monkey watching Sal's latest movie at the movie theater. He is the star of an action-adventure movie that features an evil mad scientist and a secret agent.]
Sal: You'll never get away with this, Dr. Kelpington!
SpongeBob: [whispers to the chum monkey] Mm, could you pass the popcorn?
[The chum monkey screeches at SpongeBob.]
Plankton: [still inside Mr. Krabs' stomach] Get me out of here!
Karen: Shh!


[The episode begins at the Bikini Bottom Zoo. Three peacock-like clams are sleeping until they are awoken by SpongeBob's Tarzan yell. A sea tiger opens his mouth as SpongeBob makes his yell inside. SpongeBob comes out of the sea tiger's mouth with a red ball.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Timmy! I've found your ball. And...[holds up a little girl] Your sister.
Ryan Timmy's sister: Hi!
[SpongeBob grabs the sea tiger's uvula and swings on it. SpongeBob gives Timmy/Ryan his sister and ball.]
Ryan Timmy and his sister: [giggles as they play ball] Yeah!
SpongeBob: [lets go of the sea tiger's uvula] A thousand pardons, Sir Sea Tiger. [the sea tiger licks SpongeBob and he giggles]
[SpongeBob swings over to the sea elephant enclosure and hops onto the sea elephant's head.]
SpongeBob: And the elephant says... [the sea elephant moos like a cow and SpongeBob giggles; he slides down the sea elephant's trunk] Weee!!! [jumps onto the back of a sea giraffe's long neck] The giraffe goes... [the sea giraffe barks like a dog and throws SpongeBob to the baboon enclosure] And the baboon says... [the baboon quacks like a duck; SpongeBob giggles and is thrown out; he lands on the zoo manager's head] And the zookeeper goes...
Zoo manager: [growls in anger as his mustache is set on fire] Can it with this, kid! [SpongeBob hops off] How many times do I have to tell you to stay out of the animal enclosures?! They are not pets! These are wild animals! And you can get [teary-eyed] seriously injured.
SpongeBob: [pets a giant sea monster] These little cuties are dangerous? [laughs as the sea monster roars] Don't be silly.
Zoo manger: [quivers as the sea monster looks at him; he growls angrily] That's it! [puts an ankle alarm on SpongeBob's left foot]
SpongeBob: For me? Thanks!
Zoo manager: Oh, it's not a gift, it's an ankle alarm! And the next time you try to sneak into the animal enclosures, it's gonna do this! [puts SpongeBob's foot with the ankle alarm through the sea monster's enclosure and the alarm blares]
Alarm: SpongeBob alert! SpongeBob alert! SpongeBob alert!
Zoo manager: Get it?!
SpongeBob: Got it.
Zoo manager: Good! [throws SpongeBob out of the zoo]
[SpongeBob sighs in sadness. He secretly heads back into the zoo and tiptoes into the sea giraffe's animal enclosure without triggering his ankle alarm. He hops onto the sea giraffe's back and meows like a cat. SpongeBob and the sea giraffe giggle. The zoo manager finds SpongeBob's foot sticking out of the enclosure.]
Zoo manager: [pulls SpongeBob's foot] Oh, no, you don't!
[The zoo manager struggles to pull SpongeBob out, but the zoo animals try to pull him back. The zoo manager continues to pull until he lifts out all of the zoo animals and gets crushed by them. SpongeBob climbs out of the animal enclosure.]
Zoo manager: [fuming with rage] That's it! You are banned from the zoo! Get out! Out, I say!!!
SpongeBob: [shrinks to a small size from the zoo manager's outburst] Yes, sir. I'll go. [goes to leave]
Patrick: [appears in the sea monkey enclosure] Hold it! If he goes, I go! [jumps out of the enclosure] And you can keep your dumb old peanuts! [throws peanut shells to the ground] Huh! Come on, SpongeBob. [leaves with SpongeBob]
Zoo manager: And stay out!
[The scene changes to Patrick comforting a crying SpongeBob from the zoo manager's angry outburst.]
Patrick: Oh, that's it now. Let it all out.
SpongeBob: [sobs] I-I just want to pet the critters. Does that make me an animal? [continues to cry]
Patrick: That mean old zookeeper! [scratches his back] He even looks like a monkey and he smells like one too! [scoffs] You should just make your own zoo.
SpongeBob: My own zoo? That's a laugh. [as he cries, a snot bubble forms and floats] Ooh... [catches the snot bubble] Are you thinking what I'm thinking? [the snot bubble pops]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bubble zoo!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob creating bubble animals with his bubble soap. He makes a bubble pig, a bubble duck, and a bubble rooster.]
SpongeBob: Voilà! Our first zoo animals.
Patrick: [laughs] Oh, oh, I get to name 'em! Um, your name is Aspen. [pops the bubble pig] Your name is Audrey! [pops the bubble duck] And you're Debbie! [pops the bubble rooster; he then notices that he popped them all and breaks down] Aww, I forgot they're bubbles! [cries]
SpongeBob: [brings in a big container of extra strength bubble soap and talks low] Don't be a dope. Try extra strength soap. [grabs the bubble wand, takes a very deep breath and blows a bubble penguin]
Patrick: [squeezes the bubble penguin, but it doesn't pop] It works! It works!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laugh as they jump up and down] It works! It works!
SpongeBob: [takes another deep breath and blows more bubble animals] Ooh, look at 'em, Patrick. So happy and healthy. [a bubble rhino leaves bubble droppings] Oh, and look, Patrick! Bubble droppings!
Patrick: [hops on SpongeBob's head] Bubble droppings? [happily leaps off and dances on the bubble droppings] I'm popping poops! [laughs before a bubble goat rips off Patrick's pants and eats it] Hey! [the bubble goat belches] But I was gonna eat those!
SpongeBob: [blows a bubble pants for Patrick to wear] No more "buts." We need more animals! [inhales and blows some more bubble animals]
[The scene changes to all of the Bikini Bottom citizens attending SpongeBob and Patrick's bubble zoo.]
SpongeBob: Welcome to the Bubble Zoo! Where the price of admission is a smile. [stops a frowning customer] Just a second you. [turns the customer's frown upside-down] That's better. [allows the customer to enter]
Patrick: [as the bubble zoo's security guard] Hello, folks. Please leave all your sharp objects at the gate. [stops Old Man Walker] Okay, Grandpa. Spread 'em. [puts on bubble gloves]
[Patrick dumps out a pizza cutter, a pencil, a cactus, darts, and a real-life porcupine.]
Old Man Walker: Rascal.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob showing the customers the bubble elephant enclosure.]
SpongeBob: Gather around, folks, and meet the animals! These wild bubble-phants never forget to have fun. [forms into the word, "fun" and laughs; the bubble elephants blow water in SpongeBob's face and sends him flying into the bubble giraffe enclosure where the bubble giraffes are tangled up with their necks] These bubble-raffes are necking. And they have the necks for it. [laughs as the bubble giraffes untangle themselves; SpongeBob's watch beeps] Ooh, time to feed the sea monsters. [a bubble giraffe lowers his neck] Ooh! Alley-zoop! [laughs as the bubble giraffe carries him over to the sea monster enclosure; he blows a bubble rotisserie chicken] Come and get it!
[A bubble piranha jump up and eats the bubble chicken. Then Patrick jumps up and eats the bubble piranha. Then the bubble sea monster pops out, eats Patrick, and swallows him.]
Patrick: Hi! [swims inside the bubble sea monster]
[SpongeBob looks nervously at the audience. But instead of being scared, the audience loves it. Meanwhile, Squidward wakes up from his nap.]
Squidward: [yawns] ♪Oh, up from my nap, [hums as he goes to the closet] getting my garden pants, [comes out with garden clothes and a hoe] going out the door, [exits his house] walking on the tongue, [continues walking] that's a lot of teeth.♪ [hums as he ends up getting swallowed by the bubble sea monster; he screams] What's happening?!
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! I see you're playing with my sea monsters. Isn't my bubble zoo fun?
Squidward: Get me out of here, you moron!
SpongeBob: Okay. [the bubble giraffe sets him down] Oh, Maggie. [tickles the bubble sea monster] Tickle, tickle. Let's put Squidward down. [the bubble giggles and lays a bubble egg with Squidward cramped up in it] Wow! Aww!
Squidward: [grunts as he struggles to break free and pops out of the bubble egg] Blech!
Patrick: And Squidward is reborn!
[The audience cheers.]
Squidward: Now, wait just a darn second, I- [before he can rant, a bubble goat appears and eats his clothes; he sees himself with no clothes on and freaks out; he runs over to the bubble rhino enclosure and gets his nose caught in its horn] Uh-oh.
[Squidward unintentionally provokes the bubble rhino and it starts going on a rampage.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Look out, Squidward!
[The bubble rhino stampedes through the bubble zoo and destroys the bubble ticket stand. It then destroys the bubble zoo sign and almost all of the bubble zoo itself, setting all of the bubble zoo animals free. The customers run off in panic.]
Fred: Run for your lives!
SpongeBob: Squidward, don't forget to bring it back! [the bubble zoo animals growl at him] Nice bubble beasts. Uh, let's make you some more enclosures, huh? [the bubble zoo animals trample over SpongeBob and go to wreck havoc in Bikini Bottom]
Patrick: Would now be a good time to talk about my hours?
SpongeBob: [injured and dazed] Stop those animals, Patrick! Go!
Patrick: Huh? Oh! [runs over to the bubble zoo animals and hops onto the bubble elephant's back; he takes the trunk and forms it into a hammer] Stop animules! [starts hammering some of the bubble animals] Stop, stop, stop! [the bubble elephant pulls back its trunk] Huh? [the bubble elephant hammers Patrick off its back and sends him flying back to SpongeBob] But seriously, SpongeBob. Thursdays are out.
[The scene changes to the bubble zoo animals entering the Krusty Krab. The customers run out in panic as the bubble animals begin causing a mayhem in the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the cash register and quivers in fear] Take me customers! Just don't hurt me money! [hops onto his cash register and rockets himself out of the restaurant]
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket being invaded by bubble penguins. Plankton and Karen climb higher to avoid the bubble penguins.]
Plankton: For hate's sake! I spit my last breath at thee! [spits at the bubble penguin, but it only makes it bigger; he screams and climbs up onto Karen's monitor]
Karen: Don't be so dramatic. They're cute. [bubble penguins begin flooding the Chum Bucket] Wait! Wait! [screams alongside with Plankton as they are being surrounded by the bubble penguins]
[SpongeBob and Patrick are being cornered by the bubble zoo animals.]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob, why are the animals making scary faces?
SpongeBob: They've gone wild, Patrick! Wild!
[Patrick screams in terror. He opens SpongeBob's body, removes his brain and hides inside him. SpongeBob unleashes a really loud Tarzan yell. The yell was so super loud that the wild animals from the Bikini Bottom Zoo heard it.]
Zoo manager: [hums until he sees the animals out of their enclosures] Hey! This ain't no inferno! Get back in your enclosures right now!
[The zoo animals refuse to listen to the zoo manager and they trample on top of him to go save SpongeBob, which is considered as the zoo manager's punishment for banning SpongeBob from the zoo in the first place.]
Zoo manager: [dazed] Or whenever you know I'm flexible. [passes out]
[The zoo animals arrive at SpongeBob's house just in time before the bubble animals begin their assault.]
Patrick: SpongeBob, it's the zoo animals!
SpongeBob: They must've heard my uvula!
[Patrick climbs out of SpongeBob's mouth. The zoo animals and the bubble animals growl at each other as they are about to go at war. Just then, the sea monster from the zoo appears and lets out a mighty roar. The terrified bubble animals fearfully retreat back into the extra strength bubble soap, leaving the bubble giraffe's head floating until it pops.]
SpongeBob: You guys saved our lives!
Patrick: Thank you, animules!
[The zoo animals cuddle and lick SpongeBob and Patrick out of affection. The scene changes back to the Bikini Bottom Zoo. It seems that the zoo manager appeared to have apologized to SpongeBob for selfishly banning him from the zoo earlier and is now on good terms with him.]
Zoo manager: And thank you, SpongeBob, for bringing my animals back. And I just love the new animals too. [points to the bubble animals being with the zoo animals in their enclosures] You are welcome at the zoo anytime. I officially remove the ban. [removes the ankle alarm from SpongeBob's leg] There you go.
SpongeBob: I promise you won't regret it, Mr. Zookeeper, sir. [makes a Tarzan yell and grabs a vine] I'm free again! [swings on the vine] Weee!! [swings by Squidward, who is still hanging on the bubble rhino's horn with his nose] Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: Good morning. [sighs] It's a living.
