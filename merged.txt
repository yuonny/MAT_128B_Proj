[Following the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song, the brief opening titles show the names of creator Stephen Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, and others. The episode opens with a bubble transition, and we see a coral reef under the sea. The camera zooms to initiate parallax scrolling, which reveals the city of Bikini Bottom. It continues zooming to show a brown rock, a Moai head, and a pineapple, which each contain inhabitants.]
French Narrator: Ah, the sea... so fascinating. So wonderful. Here, we see Bikini Bottom, teeming with life. [Shows from left to right Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses. Zooms in on SpongeBob's house.] Home to one of my favorite creatures, SpongeBob SquarePants. Yes, of course he lives in a pineapple, you silly. [Scene cuts to the house's bedroom. A sea snail is seen sleeping near a pile of newspapers on the floor, a scallop is seen in a birdcage, and a young, optimistic sea sponge is seen sleeping in his bed, snoring as his foghorn alarm clock ticks. SpongeBob's alarm then sounds. He wakes, but is unaffected by the annoying sound, and with a smile on his face, turns it off. He climbs from his bed to a ladder, leading to his diving board.]
SpongeBob SquarePants: Today's the big day, Gary!
Gary the Snail: Meow.
SpongeBob: [jumps on the diving board] Look at me, I'm... [jumps up, and leaves his underwear behind] ...naked! [Lands inside pants, walks over to exercise room. His head pops out of the top of his pants.] Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [He goes inside his small gym room that has a sign that reads "l Love Pain." Taking deep breaths, he prepares to lift a barbell that is balanced by two lightweight stuffed animals. He sticks out his chest, but almost passes out because he can barely lift it. He drops it, and it makes a "squeak" noise] I'm ready!!! [runs outside] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! [A dimwitted sea star's rock tilts upwards with him stuck to its underside.]
Patrick Star: Go, SpongeBob! [Patrick falls] Whoa! [crash sound effect]
 SpongeBob (1997 Version): I'm ready! I'm ready! [SpongeBob jumps in the air as the scene freezes and a title reads SpongeBob SquarePants]
 Narrator (1997 Version)&#160;: SpongeBob SquarePants! [It shows SpongeBob running through various landscapes, as it shows a frozen scene of SpongeBob standing in front of the Krusty Krab the scene unfreezes and then the episode continues as normal]
SpongeBob: [runs down the street to the Krusty Krab] There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating: The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty... with a Help Wanted sign in the window. For years I've been dreaming of this moment. I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'im straight in the eye [breaks the fourth wall and looks the audience in the eye], lay it on the line and... I can't do this! [He starts to run home, but Patrick stops him.] Hey, Patrick-
Patrick: Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob: I was just...
Patrick: No, you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get! That! Job!
SpongeBob: I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Whose first words were "May I take your order?"?
SpongeBob: Mine were.
Patrick: Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
SpongeBob: I did.
Patrick: [grimaces and contorts twice while trying to come up with a good third line] Who's a, uh, who's uhh, oh! And who's the big yellow cube with holes?
SpongeBob: I am!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?!
SpongeBob: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. An octopus is seen cleaning graffiti on the restaurant's windows.]
Squidward Tentacles: [cleaning graffiti of himself with the word "loser," sees SpongeBob, and sighs] Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
SpongeBob: [in background, at first while Squidward was talking] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, self! [Squidward looks at the Help Wanted sign, screams, and runs inside.]
Squidward: [While SpongeBob says, "I'm ready," one more time in the background] Mr. Krabs! [cuts to the ordering window, where a greedy crab is seen happily sniffing a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him.] Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you- [interrupted by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard, captain. [deep voice] I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew [normal voice] and now I'm ready. [SpongeBob trips on a nail stuck in the floorboard. Mr. Krabs and Squidward look at each other. His fall causes him to bounce against the ceiling. SpongeBob shouts and blurts incomprehensibly while his bounces and ricochets around the building accelerate. He then rolls to a stop at the feet of Squidward and Mr. Krabs.] So, uh, when do I start?
Eugene H. Krabs: Well, lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward quickly walk away from SpongeBob]
Squidward: [deep breath] No. [Mr. Krabs winks. They head back to SpongeBob, who looks completely puzzled at what he's hearing]
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad, we'll give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew. Go out and fetch me... [SpongeBob takes out a notepad] a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula... [SpongeBob quickly jots down what he says] with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments, [more scribbling] and, uh... turbo drive. [more scribbling] And don't come back ‘til you get one. [Mr. Krabs puts a Krusty Krab crew hat on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob sees how he looks in a mirror, there are sparkles on his hat, and he has a huge, satisfied smile]
SpongeBob: [saluting Krabs] Aye aye, captain! [reading] One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, Sir!
Mr. Krabs: Carry on! [SpongeBob leaves] We'll never see that lubber again.
Squidward: You're terrible. A hydro-what? [Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh. While Squidward laughs, his nose moves distinctly while he inhales and exhales. Krabs laugh sounds like a pirate. As they laugh, SpongeBob is shown leaving the Krusty Krab. As SpongeBob fades out of sight, five buses drive toward the Krusty Krab from the opposite direction.]
Bus driver: Hey! Hey! Please! Passengers are to stay seated and not put their fins out the window! [The buses surround the Krusty Krab and the doors open; Mr. Krabs stops laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] That sounded like hatch doors! [sniffs repeatedly] Do you smell it? That smell... A kind of smelly smell... A smelly smell that smells... smelly... [his eyes widen] Anchovies.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: Anchovies!! [Anchovies get out of the buses and rush inside the Krusty Krab, crowding, repeating the word "meep" over and over again]
Squidward: Please, please, quiet! [Anchovies stop talking] Is this any way to behave, hmmm?
Anchovy: Meep.
Squidward: Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register? [The anchovies stare for a moment, then pick up the boat, as their cries of "meep!" become more intense. Cut to Barg'N-Mart as SpongeBob enters.]
SpongeBob: [singing to himself] ♪ Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs. ♪  [cuts back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are still in the boat register, and being tossed around like a ship in a storm.]
Mr. Krabs: All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
Squidward: One single file line was all I asked!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! [Mr. Krabs and Squidward are thrown up in the air]  Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again; the boat is in splinters] We're taking on water, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again, with Krabs clutching Squidward] I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! [cuts to Barg'N-Mart]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments. ♪ [cuts back to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Help!
Mr. Krabs: Man overboard! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! [They climb the mast, while the anchovies try to get them down. The anchovies then form a big wave.]
Anchovies: Meep! Meep!
Mr. Krabs: This is the end! Goodbye, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! [They cry, then SpongeBob comes in with red lights flashing and flying with the spatula, singing a heroic tune]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stuttering in shock at SpongeBob getting the hydrodynamic spatula]
SpongeBob: That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with [two spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one] port-and-starboard attachments! And let's not forget the turbo drive! [the two extending spatulas twirl around and smack Squidward and Mr. Krabs in the face] Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! [to the anchovies] Who's hungry?! [Tiny Tim's "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" plays while SpongeBob serves up Krabby Patty after Krabby Patty. Numerous Krabby Patties are launched through the opening window to the hungry anchovies. Eventually, all of the anchovies are served and they leave on the buses. SpongeBob blows the spatula. Cuts to later.]
Mr. Krabs: That was the finest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants. Welcome aboard. [Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob a name tag]
Squidward: B-but, but, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
Squidward: [weakly] Hooray, Mr.-
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray. Mr. Krabs-
Mr. Krabs: I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty. [He wheels a wheelbarrow piled with an enormous stack of cash to his office. Patrick enters]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Squidward: What would you like to order, Patrick?
Patrick: One Krabby Patty, please. [The instrumental to "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" starts playing. SpongeBob flies back to the kitchen, using his spatula, and a score of Krabby Patties is immediately fired through the servery, which collide with Patrick and send him flying out of the Krusty Krab. Cuts to Krusty Krab exterior; crashing noises.]
Patrick: [screams]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [singsong] Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee...!


[The episode opens up with SpongeBob's, Patrick's, and Squidward's houses.]
[Squidward opens his door, sees that a flower does not stand up straight and then fixes it.]
[The scene pans to show that everything on his lawn is clean, except for a seashell on the left side of it.]
[The camera shows Squidward angry. He walks over to the seashell, looks around and kicks it onto SpongeBob's lawn while whistling casually.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's house. The window opens, and SpongeBob's face is shown. He exits through his window and sits on its rim. He notices the seashell on his lawn, he gets an idea and starts sliding to the back of his house to his garage to get a reef blower. The giant backpack-like container, with a blower hose, which looks like a jet engine, a power switch, and a pull starter.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward resting on his hammock.]
[Squidward hears the reef blower's motor throbbing. He sees SpongeBob exiting out of his garage with the reef blower. Squidward grumbles and puts in his ear plugs so that he can continue to rest.]
[SpongeBob gets to the seashell and tries to blow it away from his lawn by using the reef blower. He does this twice. He then blows extra hard, and a huge amount of sand is thrown in the air.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward eating some vegetables when the huge amount of sand falls from the sky and buries him. SpongeBob runs towards Squidward and blows the sand away.]
[Squidward looks at a leaf on his plate with grains of sand on it.]
[SpongeBob cleans the leaf in front of Squidward's head, tearing apart half of the leaf and causing grains of sand to get into Squidward's eyes. SpongeBob cleans Squidward's eyes with another blow.]
[The scene changes to show a large pile of sand on SpongeBob's lawn.]
[SpongeBob points his finger to it and mouths a word and the caption says "You!". He walks to the pile of sand, sets the reef blower to reverse and uses it suck up the sand from his lawn.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's lawn clean, but then reef blower starts breaking apart, throwing out sand and parts of the machinery.]
[SpongeBob takes off the reef blower. He unzips the pack. He goes over to pick up the thrown out contents. The reef blower coughs while he is absent. He returns with large hands carrying the thrown out contents. He zips it back up and pulls the pull starter in an attempt to try to start it. The motor starts and then dies.]
[The camera shows him becoming angry or just determined. The scene changes and he pulls the handle very far.]
[SpongeBob lets go of the handle, which stays still. SpongeBob wipes his hands together. He grabs the handle again. The handle pulls him away, leaving a bubble silhouette of SpongeBob that quickly dissolves. SpongeBob passes an intersection where two fish in two different cars going opposite directions stop. He passes some houses and finally returns to the reef blower, where he gets strapped in.]
[The reef blower starts, sucking up all the water in the sea, causing Squidward, who is sitting on his front doorstep, to gasp due to the inability to breathe air. His eyes also change into X's.]
[The scene changes to show the reef blower massive, and then it explodes, causing water to cover the screen. When the water stops, the screen shows big piles of sand everywhere, but SpongeBob's lawn is relatively clean.]
[SpongeBob exits one of the piles, wipes his hands together, and happily enters his house.]
[Episode ends with Squidward at his doorstep, with a pile of sand covering him except for his head. The seashell falls on Squidward's nose. Squidward narrows his eyelids.]


SpongeBob: [Stands in Jellyfish Fields. A blue jellyfish floats by SpongeBob. SpongeBob creeps from behind a bush and stares at the jellyfish through a telescope. Cuts to his view with the telescope] Wow, four stingers. [Puts away the telescope and puts on his glasses. Cuts to the jellyfish, where SpongeBob floats over it with his net. Cuts to the jellyfish alone, where SpongeBob's foot stretches out from off-screen and then the rest of his body appears. He attempts to grab the jellyfish in his net, but he catches himself in the net, then the jellyfish flies away. In the background, a young girl's voice is heard struggling. SpongeBob looks down a cliff and sees the land creature trying to fight a giant clam attempting. SpongeBob gasps.] Where have I seen this before? [takes out his Field Guide book and skims through the pages] Here it is. [cut to picture of a squirrel] Land squirrel. [He closes the book] That little squirrel is in trouble. [cuts to the squirrel, who is pushing the clam into the ground]
Sandy Cheeks: Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners! [she walks away] You're about as ugly as homemade soup.
SpongeBob: Hooray, land squirrel! [cuts back to the land squirrel, who is oblivious to the clam resurfacing and jumping right at her. Cuts to SpongeBob, who is shocked, his glasses shoot up] Look out! [scene cuts to the clam with Sandy trying to escape the clam] Hold on, little squirrel! [He does a karate yell in front of the clam, then does the same while bouncing to different sides. He jumps high in the air, and lands on top of the clam; he poses on top of the giant clam.] You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai! [tries to pry open the clam; he stops] Hey, I'm actually doing it. [SpongeBob continues, Sandy finishes prying the clam open from inside it and SpongeBob goes flying into a sea plant.] Your shell is mine! 
[SpongeBob pulls up his pants and starts to charge at the clam. He jumps into the clam's mouth and starts to strangle its tongue. SpongeBob sees that Sandy has already escaped and the clam swallows him now.] 
Sandy: Hold on there, little square dude! [She then gets SpongeBob out and kicks the clam around some more and finally kicks it across the sea. The clam whimpers. Sandy leans down to see if SpongeBob is okay.] 
SpongeBob: Hey, you like karate too. [SpongeBob does some karate poses, then he stops and falls flat on his head] So, uhh, what's your name? 
Sandy: Sandy. [makes athletic moves] So what do y'all call yourself? 
SpongeBob: [runs up a big rock] I'm SpongeBob! [jumps down, SpongeBob soon lands on one of his corners] 
Sandy: Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this. [she walks next to a huge rock and slaps it with her hand, making a gong sound effect which precedes the rock breaking into pieces] 
SpongeBob: Oh. [Sandy grins and blinks] Oh yeah? Watch this [He prepares to do a karate move, but all he does is make an armpit fart noise. Sandy walks on-screen giggling] 
Sandy: I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah![Karate chops SpongeBob’s head.] 
SpongeBob: Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah! [Karate chops her helmet, but realizes it hurts.] Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head? 
Sandy: Why, that's my air helmet. 
SpongeBob: May I try it on? 
Sandy: Heck no. I need it to breathe. I gotta have my air. 
SpongeBob: Me too. I love air. Air is good. 
Sandy: No kidding? 
SpongeBob: Why, "air" is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air. 
Sandy: Shee-oot. How about comin' over tomorrow for tea and cookies then? [shows a map leading to Sandy's house] Don't be late. 
SpongeBob: Okay, see you tomorrow. [runs to Patrick's house. Patrick is sun tanning on his rock] Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air? 
Patrick: Huh? 
SpongeBob: I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air. 
Patrick: Do you mean she puts on "airs"? 
SpongeBob: I guess so. 
Patrick: That's just fancy talk. If you wanna be fancy, hold your pinky up like this. The higher you hold it, the fancier you are. 
SpongeBob: [holds his pinky up] How's that? 
Patrick: Higher. 
SpongeBob: Like that? 
Patrick: Now that's fancy. They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants. [cuts to Sandy's treedome] Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching. [Opens the door as SpongeBob walks in with his pinky raised high and flowers in his right hand.] 
SpongeBob: Thanks, pal. [rings the doorbell with a bouquet in his hand] 
Sandy: Hello? 
SpongeBob: Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob. 
Sandy: Hold on a sec, I'll let you in. 
SpongeBob: [whistles then all the water goes down the drain. SpongeBob bangs on the door] Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy! [Sandy opens the door and SpongeBob jiggles on the ground] Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in... [looks around] ...here. 
Sandy: ‘Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air. 
SpongeBob: [waves his hand around and smells the air] No water? 
Sandy: That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah! 
SpongeBob: Problem? [laughing] Hi-yah! That's how I like my air! [takes a deep breath as Sandy walks off. As soon as she leaves, he lets it all out, and gets black circles around his eyes] With no water. 
Sandy: [cartwheeling] Well, alright. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah! [SpongeBob is walking an inch forward and it makes weak squeaking sounds with every step] That's not in. In. [SpongeBob walks another inch and there is more squeaking. Sandy runs, gets SpongeBob, takes his hand, and runs off] You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour. [fades to the blazing sun and pan down where Sandy and SpongeBob are standing] So this is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest... [SpongeBob gasps] ...purest... [SpongeBob gasps again] ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath. [Cuts to the birdbath, where a red robin is splashing and chirping] And that's my oak tree. [SpongeBob seems enticed by the water in the birdbath. He tries to sneak away, but stays until Sandy lets her guard down] It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bees knees? [SpongeBob nods] Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I... [SpongeBob finally escapes and wallows in the birdbath, absorbing all the water. He then jumps back to his original spot, and the bird is quite angry. SpongeBob gets back before Sandy notices] ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Let’s have that tea now. [Does in-air karate moves and moves off-screen. SpongeBob gasps. He hears some knocking from outside. It's Patrick, pointing at his pinky] 
Patrick: Pinky. Pinky. 
SpongeBob: [blinks, weakly holds up his pinky, and gasps again. Fade to him sitting at a picnic bench. He now has little wrinkles around his eyes and his mouth is all puckered up. He holds up his bouquet] I brought you some flowers. 
Sandy: [walks over] For me? How sweet. [Sandy grabs the flowers, but SpongeBob refuses to let go. She finally pries them loose and part of SpongeBob's pinky falls off. He closes his hand] You okay? 
SpongeBob: [the black circles around his eyes are gone. His voice is now hoarse] Yes, I'm okay. 
Sandy: You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit. 
SpongeBob: I can’t imagine why. 
Sandy: Can I get you anything? 
SpongeBob: Water would be nice. 
Sandy: I'm gonna to put these in a vase. 
SpongeBob: Take your time. [Sandy goes in her tree and closes the door off-screen. SpongeBob hears it, he then gasps and stumbles toward the door and struggles to open it] I gotta get out of here! [screams and then thinks] 
Sandy: [in SpongeBob's head] I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree. 
[SpongeBob struggles even more] 
Patrick: [in SpongeBob's head] When in doubt, pinky out. 
SpongeBob: [lifts his pinky up. He then gets confidence and victorious music plays.] I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... [he then sits down, loses confidence again and the music stops] 
Sandy: Why, these flowers are just beautiful! [sniffs] They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice cold water. [puts the vase down. SpongeBob is totally enticed by the water. Sandy sits down across from him] So tell me about yourself. [Sandy puts her hands under head feeling fascinated about SpongeBob sharing himself] It must be fascinating bein' a sea critter. [SpongeBob watches a drop of water drop down the side of the glass] SpongeBob? [a timer goes off] Oh, there's the cookies. [walks back into the tree] Be right back. 
SpongeBob: [thinking] I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face. He's really shriveled now] I don't need it. [close-up of vase, then another one of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [close-up of vase] I don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [long pause, finally yelling ] I need it! [He shoots up into the air, bounces off the ceiling and holds the vase.] 
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!
SpongeBob: [holds up his pinky and starts guzzling down the whole vase of water] I'm a quitter! [screams and runs around] 
Patrick: [enters into the dome and slams the door shut] You can't leave now. You'll blow it.
SpongeBob: [hanging on the door] Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good.
Patrick: [grabs SpongeBob off the door] You're just being shy. [carries SpongeBob to the picnic table] Don't worry, buddy. You're doi'’ fine. [starts getting weak] I won't let you blow... this. [drops SpongeBob and crawls on the floor, panting. He coughs and sputters, then stands up] What kind of place is this?! [runs toward the door and tries to open it] There's no water in here!
SpongeBob: [joins in on the door-opening struggle] I tried to tell you!
Patrick: We've gotta get out of here!
SpongeBob: You're... doing it... wrong...
Patrick: Wait, no! We've got... to get... out. [The two pass out.]
[fades to the sun]
Sandy: [walks out of the tree with tea and cookies] Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this...
[She screams and drops her tray. On the grass is a live-action sponge and starfish. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick leaning against a ladder with two goldfish helmets on. Sandy, on top of the ladder, uses a hose to fill those helmets with water.] 
Sandy: There, that oughta do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked. [Sandy carries over a tray with three tea glasses. Everyone takes one] I propose a toast, to new friends. [She drinks it. SpongeBob and Patrick lift their drinks up and they clink the glasses on the helmets, causing them to spill] Hold on a second. [She places a tea bag in each helmet, allowing the two to drink the tea water] I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up. [Patrick nudges SpongeBob and they both put their pinkies up. They sip the tea.] 
All: Ahhh... 
[Screen cuts to black.]


[Pan across Goo Lagoon]
Narrator: Ah, Goo. Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me, but to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful, stinky mud puddle. [SpongeBob and Sandy sit enjoying the beach. SpongeBob sighs]
SpongeBob: What a great day. [he runs off] Hey, Sandy... look! [he is now covered in a mound of sand] I'm Sandy!!
Sandy: Hahahahaha!
SpongeBob: [Sandy laughs. SpongeBob forms sand around his head and nose to look like Squidward and imitates his voice] Hey Sandy, who am I? [Sandy still laughs. SpongeBob picks up a sand phone] Hello, SpongeBob? Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. [Sandy continues laughing]
Sandy: SpongeBob! [a doorbell rings, SpongeBob walks in carrying sand pizza boxes and wearing a Krusty Krab sand hat]
SpongeBob: Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? [SpongeBob and Sandy laugh together. Larry walks up]
Larry the Lobster: Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.
Sandy: Hey, Larry.
Larry: You guys wanna go lift some weights?
Sandy: Sure. [she and Larry walk off] Well, come on, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob's sand pizzas and hat fall flat as he walks on dejectedly]
SpongeBob: [disappointingly] Coming. [Cut to a group of weightlifters, each grunting as they work out. Larry turns to Sandy]
Larry: Give it a try, Sandy. [Sandy stands in front of a weight. She picks it up, grunting as she does so. The crowd cheers for her, and she throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? [SpongeBob tries to walk off]
Larry: How about a little more weight? [Larry bends down to pick up a weight heavier than Sandy's] Observe. [Larry grunts as he picks it up, his eyes bulging, and veins stick out from his neck. The crowd cheers, and Larry throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: All right! Stand back, everyone! [SpongeBob picks up a single twig from the ground. The crowd is silent. He sinks into the sand. Sandy walks to a weight]
Sandy: Y'all watch this! [Sandy picks up an anchor weight. The crowd cheers for her, but stop when they realize Larry has lifted the spectator stands] Way to go, Larry! [SpongeBob burrows into the sand, and tunnels over to a fish picnicking next to a marshmallow sack]
SpongeBob: Could I borrow a couple of these?
Darwin: [through his marshmallow-filled mouth] Mm-hmm. [crams another marshmallow into his mouth.]
SpongeBob: [takes two marshmallows and places them on the twig] And now, with the addition of two, COUNT 'EM, two marshmallows! [SpongeBob preps himself for his lift, inhales deeply, takes hold of the twig, and is unable to lift it. The crowd isn't moved. He tries again. And again. After a huge effort, SpongeBob hears a rip. He looks down and notices that he's ripped his pants. The crowd gasps, then laughs at SpongeBob. SpongeBob scuttles off, embarrassed. Scooter walks over, laughing]
Scooter: That was too funny. [he slaps SpongeBob on the back] You are hilarious!
Sandy: Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw? [SpongeBob grins widely. Cut to Larry]
Larry: Anybody up for some volleyball? [the ball volleys back and forth, until Larry spikes it into some fish and the crowd cheers for him. SpongeBob looks at him in contempt. A fish serves the ball and as Larry is about to hit it, SpongeBob interferes]
SpongeBob: I got it! [the ball falls and SpongeBob tries to serve it] Incoming! [the serve misses and the crowd boos. He bends down to pick the ball up and rips his pants] Oops... I guess I ripped my pants again! [the crowd laughs. Scooter walks in laughing again]
Scooter: Once again, dude, [he slaps SpongeBob on the back] YOU have split my sides! [he continues to laugh. Cut to a Frisbee. Larry catches it and throws it to Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?
Sandy: Okay, here it comes! [SpongeBob stands still and lets the Frisbee hit him on the head, knocking him over]
SpongeBob: I could use a hand here! [he laughs. Sandy walks over and helps him up]
Sandy: You okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess so... [he does a handstand, revealing his pants] ...except I ripped my pants! [the crowd laughs, and Scooter walks up to SpongeBob once again]
Scooter: You still got it, dude! [he slaps SpongeBob on the back again. Cut to SpongeBob and Sandy walking to an ice cream vendor]
Lou Vendor: May I help you?
SpongeBob: I'll take a banana split.
Lou: Uh, we don't have that.
SpongeBob: That's okay, I already "split" my pants! Get it??? [Sandy giggles]
Lou: [annoyed] Tee-hee. Anything else?
SpongeBob: How about, ripple? [he does so, Sandy giggles again] No, thanks, already got one. [Sandy drops laughing, Lou is unamused, and SpongeBob happily bounces off to a snack bar. SpongeBob runs up to Harold, knocking his drink over] Is that a burger you're eating?
Harold: Why, yes, it is.
SpongeBob: You know what would go good with that?
Harold: No, what?
SpongeBob: [whispers] Ripped... pants... [SpongeBob smiles widely and shows the annoyed Harold his ripped pants. SpongeBob then runs around the snack bar, laughing. He comes up in-between two fish] Ripped pants a la mode! [he rips his pants, the fish are annoyed. Cut to SpongeBob being in the kitchen of the snack bar, next to the fry cook] Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? [SpongeBob shoves his behind through the box, revealing his ripped pants. He laughs and the box is revealed to have no lower part. The fry cook groans disgustedly. Cut to a broadcasting booth over looking the lagoon]
Perch Perkins: Surf's up in the Goo Lagoon. [fish are surfing. Close-up of Perch Perkins] And here comes Larry, doing his trademark lay-back. [cut to Larry lying on his surfboard] There goes Sandy, hanging ten... fingers, that is. [cut to Sandy doing a handstand on her surfboard] There goes SpongeBob... [rip] ripping his pants again. [Perch Perkins is annoyed, then cut to SpongeBob ripping his pants on his surfboard. A wave knocks SpongeBob off his surfboard and washes him up on the beach]
Lifeguard: Hey, look! A cardboard box washed up on the beach! [he takes a closer look through his telescope] HOLY FISH PASTE! IT'S A GUY!!! [he sprints over to SpongeBob and flips him over] WHY?! WWWUUHHHYYY-HY-HY-HY?!! WWWUUHHHHAAAAAA-HY-HYY-HYYY-HYYYYGH?????!!!!! [a crowd gathers around SpongeBob and the lifeguard]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [to lifeguard] Come closer... [a divine light shines on him] I need... I need...
Lifeguard: What do you need?! [tears come to the lifeguard's and Sandy's eyes]
SpongeBob: [pats the lifeguard on the shoulder. Close up of SpongeBob's mouth] A tailor. [the light turns off, accompanied by a light switch] Because I ripped my pants!! [he laughs. The lifeguard makes an annoyed expression, drops SpongeBob, and the crowd surrounding him walks off with annoyance. SpongeBob is left alone and Sandy walks up to him angry]
Sandy: That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick! [she walks off. Scooter walks towards SpongeBob and looks at him sadly]
Scooter: [he shakes his head] Dude... [he walks off. Cut to a dressing tent, with SpongeBob inside]
SpongeBob: [thinking] Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think. Your public's waiting. [speaking] Let's see... [checking them off a list] "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown," [he uses his pencil to write the word "NO" and circle it] Noooooooo. Come on, think. I got it! Hey, everybody! [he runs out of the dressing tent] Not ripped pants! [he tears his pants off] Pants ripped off! Huh? Someone call the police, there's a pants thief on the loose! [the wind howls, SpongeBob standing alone on the beach. A tumbleweed rolls by. SpongeBob turns and hears party music at a distance, and sees Larry and Sandy playing volleyball] Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. [lies on the beach as he continues saying, no] We blew it, pants. [throws his pants aside]
Pants: What do you mean, "we?" [the pants walk off, leaving SpongeBob alone]
SpongeBob: Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! [Millie walks up to SpongeBob, shining red]
Jennifer: No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen. [she places a fin on herself, and it leaves a sounding mark, which vanishes]
SpongeBob: Ouch. [a fish walks up to the two]
Dexter: No, I am. I got sand in my buns. [he shows them two sandy hamburger buns. There is a rumbling coming from the sand and a whale pops his head out of the sand]
Frank: No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.
All: What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I lost my best friend.
All: How? [SpongeBob grabs a sand guitar and sings]
SpongeBob: When I ripped... [his underwear starts ripping] my pants. [he starts to sing] I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I [rips his underwear again] ripped my pants. [the other three "losers of the beach" assemble on a sand stage with sand instruments and sing]
All: ♪When big Larry came round just to put him down, SpongeBob turned into a clown, and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and [Jennifer turns around and suddenly, her bottom then rips, splitting open, revealing her white underwear] ripped his pants!♪
SpongeBob: [singing voice, a crowd begins to gather] ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪
All: ♪Or sand in your buns!♪ [instrumental break. The sandy bun fish scrapes the two buns together to make a rhythm then the curtain shows waves crashing about]
SpongeBob: ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ [the whole group comes together one by one in sync with the music and they rip their pants. By now, a huge crowd has gathered and is cheering the group onstage. A blimp flies by with SpongeBob's name on it. It's revealed that SpongeBob and his band were having a concert.]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sandy! [she gets onstage and hugs SpongeBob. He returns the embrace]
Sandy: Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself. [Larry walks up]
Larry: [impressed with SpongeBob's singing during the big concert] SpongeBob, that was so righteous. [hands SpongeBob a pencil]  Would you... sign my pants??
SpongeBob: Absolutely, buddy. [SpongeBob bends down to sign Larry's pants. His underwear then rips off completely, leaving SpongeBob "au naturel." Someone off-screen whistles. SpongeBob covers his crotch, grins, and blushes sheepishly]


Squidward: Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created. [blows kiss] Congratulations, chef! [gets dressed, takes a shower, gargles, and brushes his teeth. He re-enters the scene in a tuxedo and sits down at the table. He hears laughter from outside. He goes to the window and notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with bubbles. SpongeBob whispers into a bubble and it floats over to Patrick and pops.]
SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick.
[Patrick giggles as he was about to blow a bubble. He eats the bubble and whispers into another bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob where it pops.]
Patrick Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward, now annoyed, notices a liquid coming from his soufflé, pours it into a bowl and starts rapidly stirring the liquid with a fork until it becomes bubbly. Meanwhile, outside, Spongebob whispers into another bubble]
SpongeBob: [whispering into bubble] Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
[The scene cuts to Squidward's back window as he finishes stirring the liquid, and blows a bubble with it through the fork. Squidward's bubble is approached by SpongeBob's bubble, grows a leg, and kicks SpongeBob's bubble, thus popping it. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops.]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.
[Patrick frowns and blows a bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [whispering into the bubble] Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. [the bubble floats over to Patrick and pops, followed by another bubble floating back over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly. [another bubble comes over and pops] Yellow is ugly! [two other bubbles, but smaller, float over and pops, both containing raspberry noises for SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [talks into the bubble, puzzled] Patrick, what are you talking about?
[The bubble floats over to Patrick. Another bubble of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you. [SpongeBob gasps] You give bottom dwellers a bad name.
[Squidward creates several other bubbles and they float over to SpongeBob]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!
[Squidward laughs. Another bubble floats over to Patrick]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!
Patrick: [stands up and yells at SpongeBob] Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
SpongeBob: [stands up and yells at Patrick] Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
Patrick: Right, you're a turkey!
SpongeBob: What's that? [Squidward arrives outside with a lawn chair and his soufflé]
Patrick: It's what you are!
[Squidward begins to laugh hysterically at SpongeBob and Patrick's arguing.]
SpongeBob: Well, you're a bigger one!
Patrick: Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You are!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! [he goes inside through the back door and turns around] Aww, tartar sauce! [shuts door]
[Patrick angrily opens his rock, which closes and comes up sounding like an accordion. ]
Squidward: [Laughs at Patrick. Puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth.] [Continues laughing. Moves his tentacles around in laughter, then lies back in laughter accidentally swallowing the fork and choking on it. Chokes on the fork repeatedly and his skin turns to a deep shade of blue as the letters "K" and "O" appear in his right eye and left eye respectively and flashes appear. Squidward passes out and drools]
Patrick: Wow, Squidward, you're choking! [runs over to Squidward] Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well. [he takes a deep breath and performs CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick catches it] I win!
Squidward: Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Patrick: I did?
Squidward: Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend! [shakes Patrick's hands]
Patrick: Friend? [holds Squidward] Friend...
Squidward: [uneasily] Yeah, Patrick, we're friends... [steps back] just friends. [they both notice SpongeBob is gazing from his window with a blank stare]
Patrick: So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? [walks with Squidward over to the Easter Island head]
Squidward: Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Patrick: Clarinet? I love music!
[inside the pineapple, SpongeBob watches the two go inside Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? [Gary is sleeping inside his shell] Gary? [knocks on his shell]
[cut to Squidward's]
Squidward: Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Patrick: [sitting on a bench while clapping] Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! [Squidward takes a deep breath and plays a note, and Patrick immediately falls asleep, to the annoyance of Squidward. Scene cuts to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! [he holds up three fingers] Uhh... [he draws faces on each finger with a broken smile] The gang's all here... [he looks at the faces on his fingers, and his eyes well with tears] Ohhh!
[Squidward is dragging Patrick, who is still asleep, outside. Suddenly, after a few feet, his back gives out]
Squidward: Ow! Oh! My back! I threw out my back!
SpongeBob: [sees Squidward in pain] Oh, boy, now's my chance! [jumps out of the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
SpongeBob: [running] Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
Squidward: No, no, no, get away from me!
SpongeBob: Hang on! I'll save you! [rips off his suit revealing a speedo underneath]
Squidward: [tries to get to his door] No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
SpongeBob: [jumps off a diving board] Hold on!
Squidward: No, no! Get away! [screams as SpongeBob dives into his back cracking it back into place] Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend! [SpongeBob smiles big]
SpongeBob: Friend...
Squidward: N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. [Squidward and SpongeBob walk into the Easter Island head] So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
Squidward: You play?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! [he takes one from the wall] Give me an A, buddy! [Squidward plays a note and SpongeBob sings] Squidward is my best friend in the world. [grates strings with bow] Squidward is my best friend in the sea...
[The bow flies into what looks like Squidward's head and he screams. Fortunately, it turns out it's just a painting; the real Squidward pulls the bow out and growls as he snaps it in half with his knee]
SpongeBob: [now playing with his fingers like a guitar] Squidward...
Patrick: [pops in through the window] Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob. [SpongeBob slams the window in Patrick's face] Oh!
SpongeBob: [strums harder before slamming the bass to the floor] And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer! [smashes the bass] Umm, I can fix this. [Squidward is steaming red in fury]
Squidward: Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! [he kicks SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
Squidward: Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. [opens up the curtain and screams after he sees Patrick in his tub]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. [shows him a brush and soap]
Squidward: Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on! [SpongeBob peeks in through the upstairs window]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? [notices Patrick in the bath-tub] Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... [shown bath toys] ...rubber bath toys!
Patrick: [simultaneously] Oh, yeah?! Well, he was my friend first!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously] You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of...
Squidward: [screams] This can't be happening to me! [He runs away. SpongeBob and Patrick stop their arguing as they notice Squidward's gone]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
SpongeBob: Buddy!
Patrick: Squidward, where are you?!
SpongeBob: Where'd ya go, friend?
Patrick: Where are ya, ol' buddy?
Squidward: [hiding in a trash can] Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and outta my hair!
SpongeBob: [reading a magazine as the doorbell rings a letter is pushed under the door. Then he smells it] Squidward. [opens it] A dinner party? I'd love to! [SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door and Squidward opens it] Did you miss me?
Squidward: Come on in! You look stunning. [shuts door]
SpongeBob: I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy... [gasps when he sees Patrick] Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac!
Patrick: Me neither! This was a setup!
Squidward: I thought you two were my best friends.
SpongeBob and Patrick: I am your best friend!
Squidward: [takes out a bottle of soda] Well, how about some soda, guys? [SpongeBob shows him his glass]
SpongeBob: Yes, please! [Squidward gives him some soda] Thanks, friend. [flicks Squidward's nose] [drinks]
Patrick: How about some for your best friend? [SpongeBob puts his glass in front of Patrick's, so he gets the soda instead of Patrick]
SpongeBob: Thanks, best friend! [drinks]
Patrick: Can I have some now, buddy?
SpongeBob: Wait, I need some more! [pours SpongeBob another glass]
Patrick: I still didn't get any! [SpongeBob gives Patrick his soda]
SpongeBob: There ya go. More please! [Squidward fills his glass as SpongeBob drinks it really fast]
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward! [shows Squidward his glass again, but it's still full] Squidward!
Squidward: Patrick! Your glass is full!
Patrick: Oh, yeah...
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both show Squidward their glasses] Squidward!
Squidward: Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more. [walks away] Why don't you just stay here and chat? [closes door. Then we see SpongeBob and Patrick. They are extremely fat and not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door with a grocery bag. Then an explosion and crashing sounds are heard] I should just walk away right now. [opens door to find his house destroyed] What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? [pieces around the door break]
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? [both hug]
Patrick: Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
Squidward: Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
Squidward: No! Out! [both walk out]
SpongeBob: Psst, I think he's jealous.
Patrick: How pathetic. [Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around as a bubble comes and pops on the door which causes the door to fall on his back]
Squidward: Ohhhhh, my back.


[SpongeBob's foghorn alarm goes off]
SpongeBob: This is it, Gary!
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed bounces up and flings SpongeBob onto the calendar, where he lands on March 3rd with the words "boating exam today!" on it then drops to the floor]
SpongeBob: The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable! [A door opens from underneath him. He comes out of his house riding a unicycle] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Squidward! [SpongeBob rides his unicycle around Squidward's house]
Squidward: Ready to move?
SpongeBob: No, I'm ready to pass my boating test. [Rides his unicycle towards the school] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [stops his unicycle near a dumpster and jumps off of it] I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore. [throws the unicycle into the dumpster] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!
Gus: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license!
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Hey, I'm getting mine next.
Gus: Hey, I doubt it. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [jumps around the boardwalk]
Mrs. Puff: [sighs] I'm not ready. [opens the door]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!
Mrs. Puff: [with clipboard and pen in hand] We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must...
SpongeBob: First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
Mrs. Puff: I know. Okay, #1: What is the front of the boat?
SpongeBob: The bow. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: What is the back?
SpongeBob: Stern. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: #3: Right is...
SpongeBob: Starboard. [answers the remaining questions] Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924! [Mrs. Puff writes down his answers]
Mrs. Puff: You've passed the oral test. What a surprise! [gets in the boat and secures herself tightly] Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat.
SpongeBob: Oh, in this boat right here? [looks at his watch] Is it time already?
Mrs. Puff: Get in the boat, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, absolutely. [gets in and closes eyes with a smile]
Mrs. Puff: All you have to do is get on the track.
[SpongeBob's eyes spring open in awe; he looks ahead to the track that gets longer and longer in delusion]
Mrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Mrs. Puff: No, no. First thing is to... start the boat. [Mrs. Puff turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat.
SpongeBob: The boat?
Mrs. Puff: Okay, now what do you do next?
SpongeBob: Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: Yes... no, no! Don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Floor it?!
Mrs. Puff: No, no, don't, don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Okay, floor it!!!
Mrs. Puff: No! No! [SpongeBob pushes the accelerator down and starts driving backwards really fast by some spectators and drives into a lighthouse] NO! NO!!!
SpongeBob: Floor it! [After crashing, Mrs. Puff inflates and becomes big and round with a deep voice]
Mrs. Puff: OOHHH, SpongeBob, WHYYYYY?
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: [in his bed at night] I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, thirty-eight. [puts his pillow on his head]
Gary: [puts on SpongeBob's boots] Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, I'm not walking.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie in SpongeBob's bed] SpongeBob, this is star ranger, over.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] What is it, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] I got a surprise for you.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Get out of bed. [SpongeBob gets out of bed]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, now what, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Go to your closet for a surprise. [SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, I'm at the closet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] I don't know, Patrick. [SpongeBob opens the closet door and Patrick has one of SpongeBob's SquarePants on]
Patrick: Patrick SquarePants!
SpongeBob: [deadpan] Pat, don't do that. [sits in a chair] I've got too much to worry about.
Patrick: What's the problem?
SpongeBob: I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: ...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers... [Patrick's square pants rip off] ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
Patrick: Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. [takes SpongeBob's walkie-talkie]
SpongeBob: How are we going to do that? [Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob's head with the antenna coming out of the top]
Patrick: Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. [SpongeBob notices the antenna sticking out] Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? [Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. Next, we see a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob's upstairs window]
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge. Testing, testing. [looking through the telescope at SpongeBob] Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing. Testing! [loudly] TESTING!!! [screams] TEST, TEST, DO YOU READ?!
SpongeBob: Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Got your apple ready? [SpongeBob shows an apple] Lucky undergarments? Hold on... hold on... [Patrick focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word lucky on the top of it] BINGO!!! Underwear, apple, and me! You're ready to get that license! Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff. Act natural. [SpongeBob jumps out of the boat and on the ground and starts chewing grass]
SpongeBob: Mooooooooo.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, get in the boat! [SpongeBob jumps in the boat. A siren is heard as Mrs. Puff comes out an ambulance and into the boat] Give her the apple. [SpongeBob gives her the apple]
SpongeBob: Here you go, ma'am. [Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows]
Mrs. Puff: Let's get this over with. [takes a deep breath] What's the first thing you do? [puts hands and arms over head for protection]
SpongeBob: Uhh...
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Start the boat. [SpongeBob pushes a button that starts the boat causing Mrs. Puff to go crazy]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Whoa-ho! Huh? What?
SpongeBob: It's okay, it's only the boat.
Mrs. Puff: The boat? You started the boat?
SpongeBob: I... I think so.
Mrs. Puff: Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, put it in drive.
SpongeBob: Put it in drive?
Mrs. Puff: Yes, yes, yes! [SpongeBob pushes lever down to drive] Put it in drive! Then what?
SpongeBob: [lifts leg up] Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: NO! AHH, NO!!!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] FREEZE, MISTER. [SpongeBob stops] BIG. TOE. [SpongeBob's big toe pops out of his shoe and gently pushes the accelerator down]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, gracious. Oh, gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, you're coming to your first turn. [giant wall with the word wall on it is shown and a left curve]
Mrs. Puff: Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Left! [SpongeBob turns left]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Right! [SpongeBob turns right]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Oh my, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine.
Montage: [SpongeBob stops at a stop sign and looks both ways before starting to drive again. Then drives around with his left arm out making a signal. Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of SquarePants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob's diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating out of SpongeBob's fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down.]
Mrs. Puff: Splendid! Wonderful! [sign that reads finish line is just ahead] There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head? [everyone laughs] Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? [everyone laughs] And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? [everyone laughs] Oh, yes, but that would be cheating. [SpongeBob opens his eyes wide realizing he is cheating]
Patrick: HAHA! CHEATING!!! [hysterically] HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!
SpongeBob: I'M CHEATING! Mrs Puff?!
Mrs. Puff: Yes, my star pupil?
SpongeBob: I think I'm cheating...
Mrs. Puff: What's that, dear? [SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff]
SpongeBob: I think I am cheating!
Mrs. Puff: You've... you've let go of the wheel.
SpongeBob: I do have an antenna under my hat! [shows antennae under hat] There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true! [crying] I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
Patrick: WHAT!?! [Patrick runs out of SpongeBob's house and back under his rock, crying]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!
Mrs. Puff: [packing] The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel...
SpongeBob: Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
Mrs. Puff: No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat that way!
SpongeBob: No... I'm cheating...!
Mrs. Puff: At least, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: I'm cheating!
Mrs. Puff: Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!
Mrs. Puff: It's okay to cheat today!
SpongeBob: No...!
Mrs. Puff: That way! Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: Cheater...! [crashes off screen into the lighthouse again, Mrs. Puff inflates again]
Mrs. Puff: [manly voice] OOHHH, SpongeBob, WHYYYYY?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: It's okay, SpongeBob, you didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. [EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester. [Mrs. Puff cries as she is taken away by the ambulance] It'll be great! [walks away] Only now I don't even have my bike.
Gary: [with SpongeBob's bike] Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile! [rides away on his bike with Gary on his head] Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!


Squidward: [The scene starts at the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob cleaning a table] Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home!
[phone rings]
SpongeBob: I got it, I got it! Coming! [leaps for the phone, but Squidward answers it first. SpongeBob falls to the floor and exclaims]
Squidward: Hello. Sorry, sir. We're close... [Mr. Krabs snatches phone]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there! Krusty Krab, how could I help you? [customer explains order over phone] Pizza? [eyes turn into dollar signs] Ummm... of course we have pizza!
Squidward: Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Our delivery squid will bring it right over. [hangs up]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza. [Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby patties and turns it into pizza. Then he puts it in a box] We don't deliver!
Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver. [gives Squidward the pizza] But you do.
Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
Mr. Krabs: Great idea! Take him with you. [SpongeBob sneaks over smiling big]
Squidward: That's not what I had in mind!
SpongeBob: Front end... check. Antenna... [touches the boat antenna making it vibrate] check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker... [bumper sticker says "I Brake For Sea Urchins"] ...check. [uncaps the tire pressure and puts his mouth in it, causing him to inflate like a balloon, and talk in a squeaky, high pitched voice while he is now the size of a giant parade balloon] Tire pressure! [blows out the rest of the pressure in Squidward's face, returning him to his normal size and voice] ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever!
Squidward: Good, then you drive.[tosses his hat away]
SpongeBob: I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner.
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, but...
Squidward: Just do what you do in school.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.
Squidward: Back it up.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Squidward: Back... it up.
SpongeBob: Right, back... it up. [tries to move the stick shift down]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay!
Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse! Right... uhh...?!?!?! [SpongeBob imagines the words "FORWARD" and "BACKWARD" turning into Korean characters, 앞으로가 (FORWARD) and 뒤로가 (BACKWARD)]
Squidward: BACK IT UP!
SpongeBob: [shifts gears] BACKING UP! BACKING UUUUPPPPP! [boat backs up really fast]
Squidward: [tries to get the wheel] GIVE ME THE WHEEL, SPONGEBOB! GIVE ME THE WHEEEEEEEEL!
SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up! [they go over a bumpy area with rocks and then they spin around and around and around, screaming. The next morning, the boat goes over five hills] Backing up! Backing up! Backing up! Backing up... [boat stops with no fuel left] ...backing up.
Squidward: Well, you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? [echoing] We're in the middle of nowhere!
SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.
Squidward: And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?! [kicks boat and the boat's gasoline becomes full again and it drives away into the distance without them]
SpongeBob: Well... we can still deliver it on foot. [Squidward narrows his eyes. Later, both walk on the sand]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: [singing] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
Squidward: ...and my feet are killing me. Whoa! [trips over SpongeBob, who is lying on the ground] SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: [rubbing the ground] It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is no time for...
SpongeBob: Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: [pointing to the road] Truck! Sixteen wheels! Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked. [starts dancing in the road while wearing a hat] WheeeeEEEEEeeee... eeeEEEEEeee... [Squidward sits on a rock while playing with a wooden spoon]
Truck Driver: Crashin', frashin' break dancers! [honks his truck]
Squidward: He's stopping, he's stopping! [Squidward realizes he's not stopping and grabs SpongeBob out of the way where they are covered in sand thanks to the truck. Squidward narrows his eyes at the smiling SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Squidward are now in a place with heavy winds] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza [The wind blows on Squidward's nose making it touch his face so he puts it down, only for it to touch his face again so he puts it in his mouth.] is the pizza free delivery! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. [SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds]
Squidward: Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!
SpongeBob: [still being carried around in the air] I can't, it's for the customer!
Squidward: Who cares about the customer?!
SpongeBob: I do!
Squidward: Well, I don't!
SpongeBob: [wind stops and SpongeBob gasps] Squidward! [starts flying again]
Squidward: Let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! [runs over Squidward]
Squidward: Ow. [holding SpongeBob's legs] SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! It's for the customer!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [notices a tornado in front of them] Let go of the pizza! [lifts up into the tornado]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [looks down] Hang onto the pizza! [tornado spits them both out. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground] Hey! Hey! [crawls up to the screen] Where's the road? Wh-wh-wh-where's the road?! [a tumbleweed rolls by] We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go??? [SpongeBob lands] What are we gonna do now!? There's no road here!
SpongeBob: I think town's this way. [points]
Squidward: Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
SpongeBob: That's right. [points to a mossy rock] Moss always points to civilization.
Squidward: That way? That way there? [SpongeBob nods] So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
SpongeBob: [nods again] Yep.
Squidward: Well, then I'm going this way. [heads the other way]
SpongeBob: Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
Squidward: Trust me, I know where I'm going. [Pans out to show another city in the other direction]
SpongeBob: [sings] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally. [later] pizza... [starts beatboxing] pizza... [later, SpongeBob is walking backwards. SpongeBob's pants almost split into two and move up and down simultaneously while he continues to beatbox. Still later] Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and [falsetto] me-eeeeee-eee-ee-eeeeeeeeeee!! [later] Krab Pizza... for you... Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside... [Later, they are both lying face down in the sand]
Squidward: Sponge, we gotta eat something.
SpongeBob: I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. [Squidward eats some coral] No, maybe it wasn't coral... [Squidward spits out the coral] ...maybe it was sand... no, no, mud.
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
Squidward: Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No, we promised it's for the customer.
Squidward: [fancy music plays] You're right. It's for the customer.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.
SpongeBob: Well?
Squidward: Just a peek. [opens box]
SpongeBob: [he shuts it quickly] Okay, it's fine!
Squidward: No, I think I saw something. [opens box] Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine-looking pizza.
SpongeBob: [entranced] Yeah...
Squidward: What's that? Is that the cheese?
SpongeBob: Yeah...
Squidward: And the pepperoni?
SpongeBob: Yeah...
Squidward: [SpongeBob slurps] Ooh, looks good, huh?
SpongeBob: [snaps out of it] ...wait a second! I know what you're trying to do, Squidward! [closes box] I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Get away!
Squidward: Get back here, SpongeBob! [chases SpongeBob] Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Wait! [he becomes too tired to run]
SpongeBob: No! No! [runs into Squidward]
Squidward: I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
SpongeBob: Look, we're saved!
Squidward: Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
SpongeBob: No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants]
Squidward: Will you cut that out?!
SpongeBob: [to a conga beat] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again. SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
Squidward: That's just a stupid boulder!
SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder!! [sniff] It's a rock! [cries] A ro-ha-hock! A ra-ha-ha-ha-HA-hock! It's a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae. And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks. Hold on there, Jethro!
SpongeBob: [they stop outside the customer's house] I can't wait to see the look on our customer's face! [rings doorbell]
Orange fish: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir, your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
Orange fish: Wow, thanks. I've been dyin' for one of these. It... [brief pause] Where's my drink?
SpongeBob: [confused] What drink?
Orange fish: [in an angry tone] My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink!
SpongeBob: [checks through the order] But... you didn't order any drink.
Orange fish: [yelling] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!?
SpongeBob: But... but... [tears start rolling down his face]
Orange fish: Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy? WELL, I AIN'T BUYIN'. [slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry]
Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay... Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [Squidward gets angry, grabs the pizza, stomps towards the customer's house and pounds on the door]
Orange fish: [answers the door, still angry] Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't PAYIN' FOR THAT.
Squidward: [Orange fish's point of view] Well, this one's ON THE HOUSE! [slams the pizza box in the orange fish's face]
SpongeBob: [still crying] Did he change his mind?
Squidward: [smugly] He sure did, ate the whole thing in one bite.
SpongeBob: [stops crying] No drink?
Squidward: Nope. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock]
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work! [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Work...? Oh, my aching tentacles...!


Nematodes: Walking, walking, walking, walking. [continue to repeat "walking"]
Nematode #1: Hungry!
Nematodes: Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry. [continue to repeat "hungry." All eat a whole large piece of coral]
Nematode #1: Still hungry!
Nematodes: Still hungry, still hungry, still hungry, still hungry. [continue to repeat "still hungry." All eat a truck that drives by, leaving the driver floating]
Fred: Naw, dang nematodes!
Nematode #1: Thirsty!
Nematodes: Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty. [continue to repeat "thirsty." They all bounce to SpongeBob's house and take out some straws. Then start drinking up the pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are still sleeping as everything begins to shrink inside, even Gary's food bowl]
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed begins to shrink as he wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no! [squeezes through the door as he tries to get to the phone. Gary gets stuck in the door]
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Ow. Shell phone! I know. I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do.
Squidward: [on the other line] Hello?
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
SpongeBob: [as he talks to Squidward, his voice gets higher and higher and starts talking faster until the shellphone completely disappears] Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller, The walls are closing in on me, Squidward, Gary is terrified too! [the phone call is disconnected] Oh no!
Squidward: Yep, it is. [SpongeBob screams]
Patrick: [comes out from his rock] Is it time already to ruin Squid's day? [falls off rock onto his furniture, then jumps out with a tuxedo and tophat on] Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!
Nematodes: [continue sucking on SpongeBob's house, then they all burp and leave]
SpongeBob: Ohh... nematodes. [sees a seed on the ground, then picks it up] The only thing left of my house is this little pebble. [Patrick and Squidward walk up]
Squidward: What's going on here?
SpongeBob: I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! [sadly] It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
Squidward: [smiling] Yeah...
Patrick: [his eyes bulge excessively in surprise] Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!
Squidward: Well, what can I say? [begins to shake SpongeBob's hand] It's been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else. [walks back to his house] [sarcastically talks] I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo. [party favors fly out Squidward's windows as he parties] Boo-hoo! [starts to laugh]
Patrick: Squid's taking it real hard. So what are you gonna do now?
SpongeBob: I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad. [shown a picture of SpongeBob's parents smiling]
Patrick: No, wait a minute, no you don't. [shown picture of SpongeBob's parents frowning] We can build you a new house!
SpongeBob: We can't build a house!
Patrick: Well, sure, it's easy! I built my house all by myself! [antenna on Patrick's rock falls off]
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, lets get to work! [zoom in on SpongeBob and Patrick as construction workers] 
Patrick: [Patrick tries to hit a nail into a board, but hits his hand instead] Ow! Ow! Ow! [SpongeBob takes two buckets of paint, one red and one green. He pours the red paint on his backside and pours the green paint on his front side. He puts one side on a fence so that the paint gets on it, and then he does the other side the same way. He does this twice. As he tightens a loose bolt, the screen turns every time SpongeBob tightens the bolt sending Patrick sliding, falling upside down towards the sky, then back onto the ground right side up. SpongeBob nails pieces of wooden boards together in midair, and a piece falls off and lands on Patrick's hand, leading him to say "Ow!" each time. Patrick moves his board under the next board, which falls down on his hand. This happens several times. Next, shown SpongeBob's finished house, shown also with sparkles]
Patrick: [Patrick gives a big thumbs up with bandages wrapped around his thumb] We're done!
SpongeBob: Yeah! So what do you think?
Patrick: [SpongeBob's built house sparkles a bit] I wish I lived there.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: No. [SpongeBob puts the small pineapple on his head]
SpongeBob: One bedroom. [nose sticks out through the door and the pineapple breaks into pieces]
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
SpongeBob: [pets Gary] Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
Patrick: Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
SpongeBob: That'd be great!
Patrick: Yeah! We'll be rockmates! [SpongeBob and Patrick get ready to sleep under Patrick's rock] Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, rockmate.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [SpongeBob goes to sleep but then is awaken to Patrick's snoring] Oh...what the...? [Gary hides in his shell and SpongeBob puts a cork in each side of his head, and goes back to sleep. The wind blows and Patrick shivers, he then pulls the rock closer to him, SpongeBob shivers in the cold and pulls it back over himself. Gary sits on top of the rock as they keep pulling it back and forth until Patrick keeps the rock closer to him. SpongeBob gets cold and he covers himself with sand on and goes to sleep. Patrick starts drooling heavily, filling his mouth, and flows like a stream over to SpongeBob. As SpongeBob snores, he absorbs the drool coming from Patrick and becomes a fat sponge. He waddles over to Patrick and removes the corks, spilling Patrick's drool out of him and down-sizing him to normal size. Then he takes out a bigger cork and puts it in Patrick's mouth and goes back to sleep. Patrick struggles, then spits out the cork]
Patrick: [in his sleep] Oh! A spiders! Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Get 'em off, off me! Off, off, off! [lifts rock and starts smashing SpongeBob with it several times, he then goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, wake up! No, wake up! No, it's me! I'm SpongeBob! [moves away from the rock a few feet and goes back to sleep]
Patrick: Spiders! Spiders! [picks up his rock, runs over to SpongeBob, and smashes him repeatedly with the rock] Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, oh, oh, ow, ow, ow, ow! [Patrick goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: [in Squidward's house, he stands next to Squidward, holding Gary, as Squidward sleeps, he taps Squidward's nose as he whispers] Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] H-h-huh?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] Whoa. Huh? Wha-what?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever.
SpongeBob: Thanks. Thanks, Squidward. [gets in bed with Squidward] Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, oh, yeah, sure. [scoots over to the side]
SpongeBob: While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
Squidward: [sleepily] Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure. [Sleepily talks a bit, gets out of bed and walks off, then comes back with a glass of water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here. [Squidward hands SpongeBob the glass] Thanks, buddy.
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome. [SpongeBob drinks the water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I like sleepovers.
Squidward: [sleepily] Yeah. Me, too.
SpongeBob: Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
Squidward: [yawns] Good night, SpongeBob. [Squidward's eyes pop open. Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Gary walk out] [unhappy] Good night, SpongeBob. [night turns to day then rooster crows to wake everyone up. Squidward opens his eyes excitedly] Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late! [he flies into his closet, gets dressed, and goes outside] Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand outside, with bags] I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
Squidward: Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob. [changes his smile to a frown briefly] Please.
SpongeBob: Here come my parents. [Patrick beings to cry and the car horn sounds as SpongeBob's parents drive up]
Mrs. SquarePants: SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we're here!
Mr. SquarePants: Come on, SpongeBob, hurry, hurry, son, your mother has dinner waiting.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mom.
Squidward: Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags. [picks up the bags and carries them to the car]
SpongeBob: Just give me a minute. [walks back to where his house used to be] I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. [buries it into the ground in the middle of where his house used to be] You hold too many memories. [as he starts to cry, a tear falls from his nose and into the ground where the seed absorbs it, it then starts to glow. Then SpongeBob shakes Squidward's hand] Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. [walks away]
Squidward: Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye. [dances] Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye. [Patrick lies on the ground, bawling, as SpongeBob gets in the car]
Mrs. Squarepants: Come on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. [Patrick holds onto the back of the boat, lifting the front into the air, as he cries]
Squidward: [still dancing] SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving! [the seed shakes violently] La, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha! [the seed shakes even more violently] He leaving, ha ha! [seed still shakes, then it sprouts three roots] SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving! [Suddenly, the ground starts shaking. Squidward stops dancing, while SpongeBob, his parents and Patrick stare, bemused. A giant green stem grows out of the ground, SpongeBob's house grows from the plant and drops where his old house used to be and on Squidward. The stem then goes back into the ground]
SpongeBob: My house is back! [SpongeBob, his parents, and Patrick all happily run into the pineapple] Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be! [continues praising all of the returned belongings he possessed in his original house. SpongeBob returns to Squidward lying under the floor] Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
Squidward: [muffled] Forever?

TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Fleet and forceful. With the ability to assemble and charge the creatures of the deep.
Mermaid Man: By the power of Neptune!
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man, with his young associate Barnacle Boy, fights for all creatures who live in the sea, against the forces of evil.
Villain: [holds a baby's lollipop and he spots the whirlpool] Oh, no! The Raging Whirlpool! [the whirlpool catches him and the lollipop falls on the baby's tongue]
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man! Champion of the deep.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! Champion of the deep! Woo!
SpongeBob: [dressed up as Mermaid Man] Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
Patrick: [dressed up as Barnacle Boy] Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man! I'm right behind you!
[SpongeBob and Patrick outside and sneak behind Squidward, who's relaxing on a lounge chair wearing sunglasses.]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good.
Squidward: [takes off glasses to notice the twosome, then puts it back on] Fun, fun.
SpongeBob: You know what this means... [pulls out a box of donuts]
Patrick: Donuts!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oohhh...
SpongeBob: [using a donut like a ring] By the power of Neptune! [Patrick bites into the donut]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, UNITE!
SpongeBob: Creatures of the deep, assemble! [both go into deep thinking] Think... harder... Barnacle Boy... [jellyfish swims by] Here they come! [Squidward blows jellyfish away]
SpongeBob: Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful.
Squidward: [under a tent] What the? Ohh!
SpongeBob: If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak.
Patrick: Jumping jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!
[Cut to Squidward destroying the tent in a fury]
SpongeBob: Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave.
Patrick: Right, Mermaid Man.
Squidward: SpongeBob! [chases after SpongeBob and Patrick, who run inside; Squidward runs up to the door and he knocks it hard] SpongeBob, open up!
SpongeBob: [Squidward continues knocking the door] Reflecto has found our secret lab.
Patrick: What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask him yourself?
SpongeBob: Elaborate, you vile fiend!
Squidward: He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
SpongeBob: Hmm, they must be working undercover.
Squidward: Yeah... now please leave me alone.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick bites into the donut again] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, reunite! [At Shady Shoals Retirement Home]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?
Manager: Undercover? Yeah... well, I'll see if they can take time from their busy schedule to see you. [SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing as they walk in] There they are. Right over there. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
Manager: Try not to surprise them.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Can you believe it?
Patrick: [holding onto SpongeBob] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk in front of the TV]
Barnacle Boy: Hey, who are those guys?
Mermaid Man: Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?
Barnacle Boy: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: Well, we used to be. But now we're retired.
SpongeBob: [shocked] But you can't retire. There's evil afoot!
Mermaid Man: Wha?! Evil! EEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIILLLL!!! [hanging on a coral pot] Barnacle Boy! Come quick! I've got the evil!
SpongeBob: All I said was, "there's evil afoot."
Mermaid Man: EVIL! EVIL! E...
Barnacle Boy: Would you please stop saying that?
Mermaid Man: [hanging on a water fountain] EVIL! Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil! [water squirts at him] Death raaaaay! [the manager comes, grabs SpongeBob and Patrick and throws them out]
SpongeBob: Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Patrick: It's too bad they're old.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. [real life captain gives a thumbs up and triumphant music plays] The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement! [fireworks appear]
Patrick: Oohhh! Pretty lights!
[At Shady Shoals Retirement Home's cafeteria]
Mermaid Man: To the meatloaf! [Receives a slice of meatloaf into his bowl] To the broccoli! [Receives some broccoli into his bowl. Mermaid Man looks at the cafeterian.] Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
Cafeterian: Here you go, son. Haha.
Mermaid Man: To the table, awaaaay!
Barnacle Boy: Careful! Don't run!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
Barnacle Boy: What do you want from us?
SpongeBob: Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
Mermaid Man: Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
Barnacle Boy: Will you cut... will you stop calling me "boy"?
SpongeBob: Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. [jumps onto one of the cafeteria tables where somebody is eating] And he globs onto the undersea dome. [puts his mouth on the table] And he starts sucking on the glass. [an old fish moves his oatmeal away from SpongeBob in disgust]
Barnacle Boy: What's your point, kid?
SpongeBob: You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
Mermaid Man: Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
Manager: [enters the cafeteria] What is going on in here?!
Mermaid Man: [points to SpongeBob, who stops smiling] You may kiss the bride! [SpongeBob gets kicked out and rolls home]
Patrick: Did you re-unite our heroes?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm married. [Back at the retirement home]
Mermaid Man: [he and Barnacle Boy are in rocking chairs] Up, up, and awaaaay. Up, up, and awaaaay.
SpongeBob: [dressed up as a woman and speaking in a Southern accent] Oh, myah. This purse is so big and heavy.
Patrick: [dressed up as a robber] Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that! [grabs SpongeBob's purse]
SpongeBob: AHHHH! Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp! [Barnacle Boy stomps over to him]
Patrick: [peaking from a building] It's working!
SpongeBob: [to Barnacle Boy] Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
Barnacle Boy: [yells at SpongeBob, ruining his makeup] Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
SpongeBob: [approaches Mermaid Man, who is sleeping with his eyes open] Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open!
Barnacle Boy: Confound it, get away from him!
Mermaid Man: [wakes up] STOP SHOUTIN'! I'M NAPPIN!
Barnacle Boy: [close up to his face] It's not me, you ol' coot!
Retired Elderly #1: Yes.
Retired Elderly #2: That's me.
Retired Elderly #3: I'm over here!
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: What do you want?
Barnacle Boy: This better be good.
SpongeBob: This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile! [The invisible boatmobile is shown almost completely covered in black paint and we also see Patrick smiling while holding a paintbrush with black paint on it.]
Barnacle Boy: GAH! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: EVIL! ...Where is it!?
Barnacle Boy: There it is! [points at SpongeBob and Patrick] You know what this means!? [opens up a box with shiny rings]
Mermaid Man: Donuts!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, brother.
[Barnacle Boy puts the ring on Mermaid Man and then they try to put both of the rings together, but they miss. Superhero sequence fails. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy wave their arms around up and down to synchronize their positioning of their arms. So then they attempt to unite both of the rings together a second time. Both rings are successfully put together but the superhero sequence fails again.]
Barnacle Boy: Say the oath.
Mermaid Man: [in his young voice] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite! [unite sequence succeeds while their rings are united together] Throw a waterball at 'em!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Waterballs! Waterballs! [Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob, but nothing happens]
Patrick: Hehehehehe...
Barnacle Boy: Mumbling morays. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Dogpaddle away! [they swim around SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: It's the Raging Whirlpoo!. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer as the whirlpool consumes them]
Mermaid Man: Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
Barnacle Boy: Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Sea creatures, unite! [they summon the sea creatures, but they are retired, so they come slowly]
Barnacle Boy: Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
Mermaid Man: Sea creatures! ATTACK!!!
SpongeBob: Pinch me, I must be dreaming. [sea creatures, now carrying torches and pitchforks, pick up SpongeBob and Patrick] Mission accomplished, Patrick!
Patrick: Yeah, we did it! [sea creatures throw them out]
Mermaid Man: I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
Barnacle Boy: We did it, you ol' coot. [they shake hands]
Mermaid Man: [confused] Who are you? [Barnacle Boy becomes annoyed]
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy play checkers.]
[Mermaid Man places a black checker on the board. A "Pow!" pow-bubble appears. Barnacle Boy replies by placing a red checker on the board. "Clack!" appears. Mermaid Man sweats, then places a black checker to the end of the board. A "King Me!" appears. Suddenly the phone rings.]
Mermaid Man: It's the Aquaphone! [he holds the phone upside down] What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello?! [Hangs up phone. "HANG UP!" appears] The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed. ["SIT!" appears]
Barnacle Boy: Remind you of what?
Mermaid Man: Remind me of what?
TV Announcer: Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
SpongeBob: Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Patrick: It's all thanks to you. [SpongeBob gives us a thumbs-up and winks; "WINK!" appears]



Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Clay: Hmmm... uhh... oh, I'll have a... [Squidward takes out a pencil and a paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Maybe... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and  the paper away] Hmmm... I'll have... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. Or maybe...
Squidward: Are you planning on ordering today, sir?
Clay: I'll have a Krabby Patty. [Squidward writes down order]
Squidward: How original.
Clay: And with extra onions.
Squidward: Daring today, aren't we? [takes order and shows SpongeBob] One Krabby Patty, extra onions. [SpongeBob takes piece of paper and puts with the rest of the orders]
SpongeBob: One cryin' Johnny comin' up! [cracks knuckles; adds each ingredient as mentioned] First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! [bell rings]
Squidward: Whatever. [John comes up and tells Squidward what he wants and Squidward relays order to SpongeBob] Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! [SpongeBob takes a plate and patties begin to appear on the plate]
SpongeBob: [at rapid speed] Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! [Squidward takes the plate]
Squidward: Thanks, Farmer Brown. [gives the plate to John] It's been a thrill serving you.
John: Can I get some extra salt?
Squidward: We're all out.
John: Could you check?
Squidward: No. [John glares at Squidward as he leaves. Bubble Bass walks up to order] Let me guess, tiny, a small salad?
Bubble Bass: I'll take a Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim. [Squidward gives up writing all of that down]
Squidward: We serve food here, sir. [SpongeBob shows Squidward he has already gotten the order done]
SpongeBob: I got it already, Squidward. [gasps] Bubble Bass!
Bubble Bass: [pushes Squidward away] SquarePants! [walks to SpongeBob] I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [staring at Bubble Bass] Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
Bubble Bass: Yep.
SpongeBob: Well then... here ya go! [Bubble Bass takes the plate and sits down where he examines the Krabby Patty until he decides to take a bite] Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
Bubble Bass: This is pretty good. Only one thing. You forgot the pickles! [shows no pickles on the patty]
Crowd: [gasp]
SpongeBob: No!
Bubble Bass: The best there is? I don't think so. You lose! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [checks patty for pickles] But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! [customers are disappointed; tears the patty apart, finding the pickles] Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? [Bubble Bass walks up to Mr. Krabs, but also throws Squidward out of the way again]
Bubble Bass: I believe you owe me two bucks.
Mr. Krabs: Two bucks?!
Bubble Bass: Your guarantee. [points to the menu where in tiny print it says 'money-back guarantee']
Mr. Krabs: Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this? [takes out two dollars and Bubble Bass grabs it]
Bubble Bass: No.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls money back] How about a discount on restroom tokens? [Bubble Bass takes money back]
Bubble Bass: Afraid not.
Mr. Krabs: How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it! [Bubble Bass walks out the Krusty Krab with the money] No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No! [walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck! [SpongeBob tries to hang onto the floor]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait! [Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!
Squidward: I need a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right! [starts a new patty] Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No! [tries again] Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go? [tries again and uses the same bun] Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it! [tries again] Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no! [Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? What? [SpongeBob walks out and goes home]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... [looks up and notices door is not there] The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing! [Mr. Krabs opens door a couple feet away] Oh. [laughs] Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain. [walks out] Uhh, which way do I live? [Mr. Krabs points the path] Of course. [laughs. Later, we see SpongeBob in his house trying to write down the formula] No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe? [throws paper and pencil away] I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight. [at night]
SpongeBob: Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or... [hits his head with his fist] D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow. [gets in between the two mattresses] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Aw, this isn't right. [he slips out and stands upside-down on his bed] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Wait, this isn't right either. [SpongeBob lays down on his back] Nope. [SpongeBob is between each railing of the ladder] Nuh-uh. [tries sleeping with a mattress on his head] Negative. [tries sleeping on the ground next to his mattresses] C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. [tries in the lifesaver] Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet! [keeps doing the wrong things as the clock fast-forwards to morning and the rooster crows where the alarm goes off. SpongeBob is under all three mattresses on the floor] Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! [picks up Gary and shoves him in the foghorn alarm where it is still going off. At The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [there is black smoke coming from kitchen. Squidward clears the smoke off with a fire extinguisher] Patties are done. [Mr. Krabs notices black, burnt patties and gets irritated]
Mr. Krabs: Urrgh! [Turns backwards from the counter after hearing customers starting to complain]
Unknown Anchovy: Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty.
Martha: He burnt my fries!
Billy: [Briefly drinks his burnt shake until realizing it is burnt.] He burnt my shake!
All customers: [all yelling and mumbling]
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!
[cuts to SpongeBob's house, he nailed a toaster to the door]
Mr. Krabs: [opens door] SpongeBob?
[music playing in reverse; the house is a total disaster as everything is misplaced and things are everywhere and opposite.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [now he has underwear on his head] Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?
Mr. Krabs: Why you talkin' funny, lad? [takes the underwear off SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: I anything can't do right since because pickles.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
SpongeBob: I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: But you're fine, me boy! [SpongeBob walks right through the wooden kitchen door] Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not. [walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is nailing a piece of bread to the table] All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: I how do that?
Mr. Krabs: It's like riding a bike. You never forget! [notices a bike in a boiling pot of water on the stove] Uhh... I'm gonna help ya! [shown both of them sitting on the ground in SpongeBob's living room] If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. [takes out a blanket with all the ingredients on it]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...
Mr. Krabs: Take your time. [SpongeBob thinks of the Krabby Patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. [Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping until SpongeBob wakes him up] I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!
Mr. Krabs: Don't talk like that!
SpongeBob: Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! [Makes patty as he tells Mr. Krabs the ingredients] I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! [notices the Krabby Patty he just made, was in the correct order]
Mr. Krabs: It's time.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rescued Squidward from the burning kitchen and extinguishes him, too.]
Unnamed fish: Hey, SpongeBob's back! [men and women are cheering]
Bubble Bass: I hear SquarePants is back! [SpongeBob opens the kitchen door]
SpongeBob: I'm right here, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: I thought I ran you out of town. [spits a loogie into a bucket]
SpongeBob: This is where I belong! [holds up bubbles and blows one] .
Bubble Bass:  [Gives a weird sounding roar]
SpongeBob: Rawr.
[The crowd gasps. SpongeBob and Bubble Bass glare at each other, while Mr. Krabs is sweating with anticipation]
Bubble Bass: Give me the regular. And this time, don't forget the pickles.
SpongeBob: [rushes into the kitchen and comes back with a Krabby Patty in the blink of an eye] I didn't.
[Mr. Krabs is violently sweating as Bubble Bass examines and eats the patty]
Bubble Bass: Hmm... ...Still no pickles! [SpongeBob notices] See? [sticks out his tongue with all the chewed up food on it. Everyone is getting sick at the sight of it and they’re disgusted] You failed again, SpongeBob LoserPants! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [looks at Bubble Bass's mouth] Wait a minute! [grabs Bubble Bass' tongue and pulls it out] Look! [shows four pickles under Bubble Bass' tongue] He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
Mr. Krabs: And there's the pickles from last time, too!
Shubie: And there's my car keys! [everyone walks up to Bubble Bass, all glaring at him]
Bubble Bass: And... there's my ride! [runs out the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Whoop-de-doo.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward! [Squidward smiles] Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Squidward is shocked and frowns. The frown becomes more droopier with each "Boo"]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Scene changes to outside of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
Customer: Boo! You stink!


Narrator: Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.
Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! [SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air] Let's see here. This weeks hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... [gasps] [shaking nervously]...SpongeBob...! [SpongeBob moves his desk between two rows] It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor.
Jimmy: Mrs. Puff, I've done it already! [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Ohh... Phil?
Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor.
Tina: Hey, I've done it three times already! [SpongeBob moves up closer]
Mrs. Puff: B...uh...B-Beth!
Student: She graduated!
Mrs. Puff: Henry?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Vera?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Clayton?! [SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs] Alright, I guess I have no choice. [gulps] The hall monitor of the day is [she sighs] SpongeBob. [SpongeBob launches into the air]
SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
Mrs. Puff: Okay! Just take the hat and belt. [tries handing him uniform]
SpongeBob: I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech.
Mrs. Puff: You can't make this easy, can you?
SpongeBob: Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Give me a break.
SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... [clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech] ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! [at this point almost everyone, is asleep] Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. [takes out a long roll of paper] "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears." [the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk] In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform [takes out the hat and belt] and assume my duties as... [puts on the uniform] ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! [walks towards the door then turns around] Oh, and I will be re... [bell rings as all students run over SpongeBob]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob: I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
Mrs. Puff: I'm afraid so.
SpongeBob: Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. [takes off his uniform] I hardly knew ya. [gives uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
SpongeBob: A-hoo! [dives into the uniform] Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I've just done? [cut to SpongeBob walking down the street, singing somewhat incomprehensibly. Then notices a broken traffic light]
SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! [directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures, but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end] What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
Fred: My leg! My leg!
SpongeBob: On patrol. I'm on patrol. [notices a house with an open window] Uh-oh, an open window. [peeks through the window and there is a couple eating]
Vera: More seaweed medley, dear?
SpongeBob: The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. [jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask, screaming as he does so] I'm the open window maniac! [both run out screaming] I hope you learned a valuable lesson! [shuts the window and begins walking again] On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... [gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground] Vandals! Another crime. [takes his finger and tastes the pink goo] hmm...strawberry! I must act! [more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick eating some strawberry ice cream] Patrick... [looks around for the voice he just heard] Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick: My ice cream! It's alive! [screams and throws away the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here!
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. [ice cream cone is on SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Patrick. Come down here. [Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'm down here.
Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That's hall monitor to you!
Patrick: Sorry, officer.
SpongeBob: Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
Patrick: What crime? [shows him the ice cream that is on the ground] I'm a bad person! [cries]
Newspaper Boy: [High Voice] Extra! Extra! "Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!" City paralyzed with fear! [gives one to SpongeBob] [Gruff Voice] Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. [runs off] [High voice again] Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob: [reads paper] "Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
Patrick: [still crying] I wanna be good!
SpongeBob: Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. [Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head] Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
Patrick: Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! [both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream]
SpongeBob: Okay, now what?
Patrick: Hmmm... [both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream]
SpongeBob: This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! [takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick grabs one and is elated with joy] And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! [SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick]
Officer Rob: Afternoon, son.
Patrick: Hello, brothers. [salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his cone hat]
Officer Rob: Son, we're looking for the maniac.
Officer John: Have you seen this man?! [He whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.]
Patrick: [screams] It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away!
Officer Rob: Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy. Understand?
Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh.
Officer Rob: Okay. [Officer John shows Patrick the poster again]
Patrick: [screams] Horrible!
[Officer John removes the poster, bemused. He holds up the poster again. Patrick screams again. Both cops then look at each other and smile slyly. Officer John repeatedly shows and takes away the poster as Patrick screams every single time. Eventually, the cops decide they've had enough fun.]
Officer Rob: Stay indoors, son.
Officer John: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. [both laugh as they drive off]
Patrick: [takes out walkie-talkie] SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!
SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared!
SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie, sobbing] I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
Patrick: Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting... [the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark] ...dark.
SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
Patrick: Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. [Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob, but Patrick doesn't realize it] [gasps loudly] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Where is he, Patrick?
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] At the intersection of Conch and Coral. [SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign]
SpongeBob: That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
Patrick: Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly! [screams over walkie-talkie] Get out of there, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams] That's his maniac shriek! He's going to attack! [SpongeBob cries while running around in circles] He's acting all crazy! Run! Hind behind that building! [SpongeBob hides behind the building] No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign! [SpongeBob hides behind the street sign] No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light! [SpongeBob gets under the street lights] No wait, agh, he's there, too! Run for your life! [SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out]
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Say again, deputy?
Patrick: The maniac's in the mailbox! [SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox. He alternates between screaming and crazily jabbering as he runs through three buildings, causing them to topple over and eventually crashes through a fence plasted with wanted posters]
SpongeBob: [takes a look at a wanted poster] Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! [Patrick screams in the background and a mass of police cars surround SpongeBob]
Officer Durado: We'll take that as a confession. [Mrs. Puff appears]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself! [SpongeBob slumps sadly at these words]
Officer #1: You know this guy?
Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility. [the cops glare at her] Uh-oh... [at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV] And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [frowns nervously] Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I'd like to see you after class. Six months from now! [jail closure sound]


Mr. Krabs: [dancing and singing at Pearl's birthday party] ♪Yar-har, Pearl's my daughter, I'll spit in your eye! Yo-ho, Pearl's a whale, and it's her birthday, yar-yar-yar!♪ Ta-da!
Pearl: Thanks for the show, Dad. Now can we open the presents?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. Here ya are. [places the present in front of Pearl]
Pearl: Oh, you shouldn't have. What is it, Daddy? It wouldn't be those totally hip new flipper slippers all my friends are wearing, would it? Everyone wants them.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...they might be.
Pearl: Whee! [begins to unwrap present] Oh, you shouldn't have, yay, you shouldn't have. [sees present] I mean, Dad, [holds up big boots] you really shouldn't have! [Pearl's friends laugh]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!
Pearl: Dad, you ruined me! [cries]
Mr. Krabs: But I got them for a bargain! [the house shakes from Pearl's screaming and wailing. Bubble transitions to the Krusty Krab] Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I'm stuck with them!
SpongeBob: [peeks into Mr. Krabs' office] Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots. [SpongeBob sits down, but the boots are in his way, so he can't see Mr. Krabs] So you want to get paid?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots [leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other] are in [leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other] the way.
Mr. Krabs: [pushes the boots aside] In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
Mr. Krabs: Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.
SpongeBob: ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable. [takes boots away]
SpongeBob: Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: Paycheck! You got a deal--
SpongeBob: And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
Mr. Krabs: You've got a deal.
SpongeBob: And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
Mr. Krabs: You got a...
SpongeBob: And... [Mr. Krabs stops SpongeBob from saying anything else]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, lad! You're gonna give me a heart attack! [shakes SpongeBob's hand] You got yourself a deal.
[Squidward is drying off a glass when he looks through the glass and sees SpongeBob wearing boots]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!
[SpongeBob bounces up and down in the boots, making them squeak, as Squidward watches. Then SpongeBob bounces harder until Squidward's head is bouncing up and down really hard trying to keep up. Then SpongeBob leaves to squeak his boots around the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music.
[Later that night, Mr. Krabs is in his room, lying in his hammock and imagining dollar bills jumping one-by-one into a cash register]
Mr. Krabs: [muttering] Money, money, money, money, money. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty... [all of a sudden, the pair of squeaky boots jumps into the register. He opens his eyes] Wha? Who's there? [rests his head on his pillow] Back to countin' me money. [closes his eyes again and imagines coins jumping into the register] One, two, three, four, five... [the boots appear again; Mr. Krabs opens his eyes again] What the barnacle is that? [he sees that the bedroom window is opening and shutting by itself, making squeaky noises. Mr. Krabs closes the window and gets back into bed, but notices the window has opened again. He walks back across the room to close it but steps into a hole and falls out the window, breaking the tip of his leg off in the process. He gets back into his bedroom, watches his step to avoid another hole and shuts the window, but it won't close. He starts shutting it with increasing force and speed until the window finally stays closed. The window reopens again, and Mr. Krabs gives it the "evil eye" followed by a growl. The window immediately closes back, as if it says "Yipe!" Mr. Krabs then starts to go back to bed, but he steps into the same hole he avoided earlier and breaks the tip of his other leg off. He screams as he gets flung into his hammock and gets all twisted up in it. Mr. Krabs can do nothing but lie there with bloodshot eyes as the window makes squeaky noises all night, as if it is clapping at him. Fade to the next morning; Mr. Krabs has his legs bandaged up as he drowsily walks to the Krusty Krab] Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work. [As he walks up to the door, Squidward slams the doors open into Mr. Krabs' face]
Squidward: That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now.
Mr. Krabs: [muffled] What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?
Squidward: I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week. [leaves the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob. [every time SpongeBob's boots squeak, Mr. Krabs stutters. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, but he is so tall, all Mr. Krabs can see is his boots]
Mr. Krabs: I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots.
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this? [runs in place fast with plates of Krabby Patties in each hand]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh...
SpongeBob: Or could he do this? [leans over to one table and sets the plate on the table without having to move from his spot at all] Or this? [leans to another table and puts a plate of patties on that table, then goes behind the register on top of the boat] And watch this, Mr. Krabs! [moves his boots around slightly, making them "talk"]
Squeaky Boots: May I take your order?
Francis: Yeah, I'll have the Krusty Special.
Squeaky Boots: Thank you, sir. I will squeak when it's ready.
SpongeBob: Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I, uhh...
SpongeBob: And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this. [does many different things with his boots until Mr. Krabs can't take it anymore]
Mr. Krabs: [his eyes go bloodshot] [screaming] I gotta go to my office! [puts seat cushions over his ears] I can still hear it! [puts chairs over his ears] It's still coming through! The infernal squeak! [he repeatedly bangs his head on his desk] Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin.
[that night, at SpongeBob's pineapple...]
SpongeBob: Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off.
Gary: [puts earplugs in] Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary.
[as SpongeBob is sleeping with his boots on, Mr. Krabs peeks over his diving board and climbs down, then takes his boots off and runs to the Krusty Krab, laughing quietly. Some hammering sounds are heard, then a rooster crows as night fades to morning]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quiet money. Silence and money. [SpongeBob bursts through the double doors]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What is it, my boy?
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs while crying] Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, son.
SpongeBob: [cries harder and looks up at his boss with tears streaming down his face] No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Mr. Krabs: Hold it, boy! It's not the end of the world.
SpongeBob: Yes, it is!
Mr. Krabs: Look, don't cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts! [holds up some oven mitts]
SpongeBob: [puts them on his feet, waits a second, then kicks them off] They're not the same! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots. [walks into the door, opens it, then goes into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Poor lad. [looks through the window and sees that SpongeBob is so upset, he has his head down... right on top of the hot grill]
Tom: Excuse me?
Mr. Krabs: I didn't do it! [sees Tom] Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?
Tom: Yeah, I'm ready to order.
Mr. Krabs: [takes out a notepad] What'll ya have?
Tom: I'll take a [squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: [becomes surprised] What did you say?
Tom: I said, I'll take a [squeak].
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob: [still in tears] I heard his order, Mr. Krabs. He says he wants [squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: What?
Tom: And a [squeak squeak squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [starts going insane, imagining everything and everyone squeaking] Huh? [looks at the menu and sees "squeak" as an item for everything] I didn't write that! [keeps thinking and hearing the squeaks. Even the dripping kitchen sink makes squeaking sounds instead of dripping sounds. Eventually he starts seeing visions of SpongeBob and his boots.]
SpongeBob: [in Mr. Krabs' head] Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?... And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this... [Mr. Krabs' eye starts swirling]
Mr. Krabs: [snaps] Stop it! [the customers look at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] Stop... it! [his eyes start contorting] Oh, oh, don't you hear it?! Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboards! [sobbing] Oh, please, make it stop! It's the squeaking of the hideous boots! [throws himself onto the floor and bawls] I'm sorry! But I can't take the infernal squeakin' no more! [lifts up the Krusty Krab and grabs the boots, with everyone screaming inside. He then walks into the kitchen with an evil expression on his face and puts the boots into a vat of grease, which shrinks them, and he eats them. After that, he opens the door to the dining room, and lets out a long burp] The deed is done.
SpongeBob: Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.
SpongeBob: You really think so, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I do, son. [hands SpongeBob a stack of money] Here's the paycheck I owe you. [puts another stack of money on top of the first stack] Plus a bonus! [walks away] I need a vacation.
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!
[fade to Mr. Krabs and Pearl taking a drive out to somewhere, with a camper behind their boat]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.
Pearl: [lifts her feet over the side of the door to reveal her new shoes] Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Darling, I won't. [as he laughs, he hiccups and the squeaky noise comes out] Oh, no. [continues to hiccup and squeak as they drive off into the distance]


[SpongeBob is grilling Krabby Patties in the Krusty Krab kitchen until one of them suddenly levitates up from the grill and turns into a jellyfish. It floats out the window as the rest of the patties turn into jellyfish and do the same. SpongeBob follows them and flies out the window and turns into a jellyfish. He buzzes around Jellyfish Fields when he hears Mr. Krabs voice.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? SpongeBob! [the grill is on fire] Wake up, boy! You're burning me money! [SpongeBob wakes up from his dream and screams. Then runs behind Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what do we do?
Mr. Krabs: Here, use this! [Hands SpongeBob a fire extinguisher. SpongeBob throws it at the grill and sets the fire larger than before. Mr. Krab looks at SpongeBob for his stupidity, as he realizes his error. SpongeBob then tries to blow on the fire to put it out until a fireman comes into the kitchen with a hose and sprays SpongeBob with the water. SpongeBob enlarges and falls backwards, which puts out the fire]
Mr. Krabs and Fireman: Hooray! [SpongeBob shrinks and burns into a black sponge while Mr. Krabs scrapes him off the grill and on to a spatula]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come into me office. [in Mr. Krabs office] What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: Well, I.
Mr. Krabs: This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something.
SpongeBob: Well, I've been thinking.
Mr. Krabs: We need to get you thinking about work. [stretches his eyes out]
SpongeBob: No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. [Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat. [shows kitchen] This is your wide open range. [shows grill] These are your amber waves. [shows greasy fryers] And this[picks up a spatula from the sink]oh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's gone] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [walks out the Krusty Krab] I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles! [throws his hat on the ground]
Mr. Krabs: [opens doors] SpongeBob, wait! [sees SpongeBob's hat on the ground and screams] Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back. [SpongeBob is now giving his stuff away to his friends]
SpongeBob: And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener. [gives it to him]
Squidward: And I thought this friendship would never pay off. [walks away]
Patrick: [teary-eyed] Are-are-are-are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?
SpongeBob: It's all yours. [Patrick holds up a bunch of phone books]
Patrick: A-a-and these old phone books?
SpongeBob: All yours, old friend. [walks off and comes back with a case] Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have. [opens up a rectangular box that has the words "Ol' Reliable" on the front. A glowing jellyfish net is inside. Patrick throws the phone books away and picks up Ol' Reliable]
Patrick: Ol' Reliable? [cries as Sandy walks up]
Sandy: Howdy, y'all. Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?
SpongeBob: No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.
Sandy: SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright. [SpongeBob pats Sandy's helmet]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy. [walks away] Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye. [walks behind a bush and takes his pants off] I won't be needing these. [drops pants and runs away] Buzz, buzz, buzz.
Squidward: He took off his pants.
Sandy: I'll give him a week. [walks away]
Squidward: I'll give him eleven minutes. [walks away, throwing off the can opener at Patrick]
Patrick: Patrick sad! [at Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: [touches Jellyfish Fields sign] I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home! [jellyfish knock SpongeBob down as they fly by] Brothers and sisters, wait for me! [jellyfish fly into a hive] Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Okay, I'm here! [jellyfish fly out of hive] Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go... [sticks his finger in his mouth and then in his head] ...that way. [points to where the jellyfish went] Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. [running after jellyfish all over the fields. Jellyfish devour a bunch of kelp. SpongeBob decides to try it but is disgusted and spits it out from his tongue] This is the life. [jellyfish are floating in the middle of the fields as SpongeBob walks into the middle of the group] Hey, everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz? [wants to shake a jellyfish's hand] Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are? [jellyfish stings him and his hand, causing it to start swelling] Uhh... nice to meet you. [hand gets huge and swollen. SpongeBob smells some aroma and goes to check and see that Patrick and Sandy are having a picnic with Krabby Patties]
Sandy: "Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!" [whispers into Patrick's ear] There he is, Patrick. Say your line!
Patrick: [reading off script] "Why, thank you, Sandy, I would love one. [take patty.]" [takes patty] "Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home. [take bite.]" [sniffles. tries to take a bite, but throws the patty and the script away and turns to SpongeBob] I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not coming home.
Patrick: I miss you! [cuts to Sandy waving hello, but in guilt  manner because of set-up] Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you! [Squidward is throwing himself a party at home]
SpongeBob: I'm happy here. This is my home now. [Sandy drags Patrick away]
Patrick: No! SpongeBob! [later, SpongeBob comes in wiggling his arms and legs like the jellyfish]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this. [jellyfish float away as the net is swung at SpongeBob, which knocks him down. Patrick, breathing heavily,  is ready to capture SpongeBob with Ol' Reliable] Patrick! What are you doing?
Patrick: If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy! [shows a jar with a label on the front that says SpongeBob - Friend] I even picked out this nice jar for you!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now! [Patrick swings the net at SpongeBob but SpongeBob runs away. Patrick goes after him. SpongeBob hides behind a snail's shell, but the snail slithers off. SpongeBob goes to hide behind a rock]
Patrick: I can see you there! [SpongeBob hides behind a bush] I still see you! [SpongeBob hides behind another rock] You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs under neath an “N” shaped rock and peeks around. Patrick is underneath the rock on the top] I got you now, SpongeBob! [falls on the ground and misses SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick! No! [Patrick runs after SpongeBob again as SpongeBob jumps into the jellyfish hive. Patrick tries to get the hive down with the net, but he can't reach it. He vainly tries to jump to reach the hive, to no avail.]
Patrick: Okay! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy! [snaps the net in half over his knee and walks away, sobbing]
SpongeBob: Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters. [a drop of jelly lands on SpongeBob nose. He samples it] Mmm, jelly. [eats a lot of jelly as the jellyfish come back toward the hive] Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning. [jellyfish buzz into the hive] Greetings, comrades! [the jellyfish repeatedly shock SpongeBob and he screams. SpongeBob climbs out of the hive and runs as the jellyfish keep shocking him. Later, SpongeBob is in a cave] Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz. [rips off a bushel of grass] Buzz. [pushes rock over as he uses it for his pillow] Buzz. [pushes the rock aside and gets cold. The blanket scrunches up, but SpongeBob pushes it back down. Blanket scrunches up again and SpongeBob gets cold] Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy! [takes off the blanket and reveals 9 poison sea urchins] Ah! Poison sea urchins! [screams and scratches the urchins off of him and runs out of the cave] Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches. [crawls on the ground to stop the itching. Later, SpongeBob is walking home] Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. [buzzes fourteen more times as he walks up to the Krusty Krab door and sees a plate full of Krabby Patties on a table] Krabby Patties. [walks past Sandy's treedome, then he sniffles] Sandy. [still buzzing, walks up to his pineapple] What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. [opens the door and turns the light on. Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Squidward, Patrick, and Gary are there to welcome him home]
All: Welcome home, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty. [hands him a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do. [eats it as Mr. Krabs places his Krusty Crew hat on his head]
Mr. Krabs: And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning.
SpongeBob: [salutes] Aye, aye, captain!
Squidward: SpongeBob, do us all a favor. [hands SpongeBob his pants]
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do. [puts on his pants] Ta-da. [hugs Squidward] Aww.
Squidward: Okay, that's enough. [everyone else hugs SpongeBob and Squidward]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Can we please stop this? [everyone stops hugging]
Patrick: Patrick itchy! [everyone but SpongeBob starts to scratch themselves and crawl on the floor]
SpongeBob: It is great to be home!


[No customers are at the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs is holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, Squidward is reading a ballet magazine and imagining his head on the dancers, and SpongeBob is wiping dust off tables.]
[Closer shot of Mr. Krabs holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, attempting to retain his smile. Piece of paper flies through the open door of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?! [Squidward is dancing] Squidward!
Squidward: Uh-uh... Yes, sir?
Mr. Krabs: There's gonna be some changes around here. [Francis walks in. Mr. Krabs gasps] A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab! [runs up to Francis with a chair and seats him. Brings him back to the table] SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up.
SpongeBob: Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?
Francis: All I wanted was change for the payphone. [shows the dollar]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir! [runs off quickly and comes back with change. Talking in a French accent] Monsieur's change. [snaps his fingers]
Francis: Thanks. [laughs nervously and leaves a penny on the table] Here you go. [runs off as Mr. Krabs smells the penny]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah! [jumps on it. Later, Mr. Krabs' puts the penny away in his safe in his office and is with Squidward and SpongeBob] Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month. [pulls down a chart with zig-zag lines going down and his eyes sticking out on each side] We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers. [pulls the chart up] Do you lubbers have any ideas?
SpongeBob: I've got one! [takes out a tray with a soda and a pair of socks on it] A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams... [talks with mouth full of clams] ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment. [Squidward gasps]
Squidward: That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me! [runs up to Mr. Krabs with stars in his eyes] This is the moment I've... [eyes return to normal] I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.
Mr. Krabs: The money? [Squidward is lying on the table]
Squidward: And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs looks at his picture of him and Pearl] Little Pearly... a star?
SpongeBob: Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks! [runs off as Squidward and Mr. Krabs shake hands]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you've got a deal. Make my little girl a star! [later, the restaurant is being redecorated for the show. Squidward is writing notes on a notepad.]
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, what time am I going on?
Squidward: Going on what?
SpongeBob: The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!
Squidward: What talent could you possibly possess? [SpongeBob blows a big bubble which turns into a hippo. Then blows two small bubbles for the hat and cane. Both dance]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! [Squidward yawns]
Squidward: No one, not even your parents, would want to see that. [hippo bubble pops] What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.
SpongeBob: Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!
Squidward: I can hardly wait. [SpongeBob runs off] Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes. [laughs] Tennis shoes. I crack myself up. [now the night of the talent show where people are outside conducting interviews and people inside are talking and getting set-up]
Lisa: [Talking in the background] We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town...
SpongeBob: [peeks out from behind the curtain] Wow! A full house! [gasps] There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud! [Mr. Krabs shakes Mr. SquarePants' hand]
Mr Krabs: Hello, I'm Mr. Krabs, and I like money.
SpongeBob: I gotta get ready! [Squidward gets everyone's attention]
Squidward: Alright, people, listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop. [performers gather around] Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it's not. It's mine.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squid! How about this for the show? [runs off and runs back with a tub full of water and the words 'Mister Absorbency' written on the front] The Amazing Mister Absorbency! [puts his finger in the water and absorbs it. Absorbs the water into his legs] Ta-da! [absorbs water into his head] Ta-da!
Squidward: No one is going to watch you engorge yourself. [grabs Squidward's legs]
SpongeBob: Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!
Squidward: So you really want to be in the show?
SpongeBob: Oh, yes!
Squidward: Okay, you get to mop up afterwards. [hands SpongeBob a mop] Now will you stop bugging me? [walks off]
SpongeBob: So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! [show starts and crowd applauds. Squidward comes out and gets the cue cards that are in his tuxedo]
Squidward: Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home. [Patrick laughs] Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well. [Patrick laughs again] Put your fins together for... [Patrick cracks up laughing very hard. Bashes on the table with laughter, shaking dinnerware. He falls off his chair] Put your... [Patrick laughs] Put... [Patrick laughs] Pearl. [crowd claps as curtain rises for Pearl, dressed in cheerleader uniform]
Mr. Krabs: Hooray! My little girl is finally a star.
Pearl: Give me a K-R-U! [jumps up and down on the stage causing the crowd to fly up and down with her] Give me a S-T-Y! [jumps up and down again] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down]
Mr. Krabs: [He, Patrick, and SpongeBob's parents get tossed up and down. Mr. Krabs appear happy.] That's what I call talent! [Krusty Krab floor is destroyed]
Pearl: Thank you!
Fred: My leg! Ugh!
Pearl: Thank you, thank you! [Squidward closes curtain and as he is lowering the rope, SpongeBob is tied to it holding a mop and a bucket of water.]
Squidward: [Screams in shock]
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, listen. What do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side. [Squidward lets the rope go and sends SpongeBob flying up. Then he walks back out on the stage]
Squidward: And now, poetry. [walks backstage but peeks his head through the curtain] By Gary. [curtain opens. Gary is on a stool]
Gary: [clears throat] Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
Sandy: He has such a way with words.
Squidward: [checks his watch] Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me! [SpongeBob walks up]
SpongeBob: Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?
Squidward: Yes. [audience applauds as curtain opens, revealing Plankton in a magician costume and a sign that says 'The Amazing Plankton!']
Plankton: I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation... [turns his wand into flowers] ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes. [throw the flowers aside] First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience. [jumps onto a table and grabs the Krabby Patty from the customer. Runs toward the door, but Mr. Krabs stops Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Nice try. Your act's over, bub. [grabs the patty]
Plankton: You may win this time. She-hah-kazing! [he claps his hands and ignites into a mini-explosion. The smoke from the explosion clears and he is completely charred] Well, this stinks. [he walks off and is booed. Mr. Krabs runs up to Squidward backstage, leaving a trail of flames]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! [Literally races towards him, like an overspeeding race car] This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!
Squidward: Now, now, don't you worry, Mr. Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.
Mr. Krabs: For your sake, I hope you're right. [bunch of spot lights gleam around Krusty Krab]
Squidward: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward! ['Squidward Live' words blink in pink and green lights. Curtain opens and the background shows a canyon. Squidward dances with birds, accompanied by classical music. Then the lights go dark and music becomes techno as Squidward dances weirdly. Makes weird noises as he dances after the first part of his dance.]
Fish: What the?!
[Squidward continues to dance weirdly. Crowd boos and pelts tomatoes at Squidward]
Mr Krabs: I'm losing money on this deal! [puts a $1.00 sticker over the free sign on the salad bar. Grins.]
Fred: It's worth every penny. [everyone runs up to Mr. Krabs with dollar bills in hand]
Squidward: You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!
Crowd: No talent! No talent! No talent! [curtain closes]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, can I go on now?
Squidward: Yeah, show's over! [crown continues booing as SpongeBob walks out and mops up the tomatoes. Crowd gets interested in this and applauds at him]
Crowd: Hey, yeah. That's really not bad. I like that. Alright! [SpongeBob briefly stops mopping and the crowd becomes silent. He then starts mopping faster getting even more applause. He then leaves stage right and the applause stops. He peeks from where he left and mops the floor while leaving stage left which starts the applause again. He waves goodbye to the crowd] We want more! We want more! We want more! We want—
Squidward: They want an encore! [pushes SpongeBob away] Stand aside, SpongeBob! [Squidward jumps out and the crowd grows silent. He goes backstage and SpongeBob comes back out mopping and crowd cheers again. SpongeBob leaves stage left as Squidward jumps out again and the crowd instantly becomes silent again. Squidward is angry.]
[Squidward goes backstage and grabs SpongeBob. Then shows the crowd SpongeBob and they cheer. Then he puts his own head through the curtain and the crowd goes silent.]
[SpongeBob's arm gets a cheer, but Squidward's does not. SpongeBob's leg is shown then curtain rises and SpongeBob is mopping. Curtain closes then opens to reveal Squidward mopping and the crowd goes silent.]
[Squidward stops and he is angry. He tries to mop somewhere else to impress them. He then raises his hands up in a ta-da moment, but someone in the crowd throws a tomato and SpongeBob sweeps it up as the crowd cheers. Backstage, Harold and Margaret SquarePants bring Mr. Krabs up in a wheelbarrow full of cash.]
Mr. Krabs: You did it, Squidward! What a great show!
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, my son's a star!
Mr. SquarePants: Who ever knew he had such talent.
Mr. Krabs: I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show! [crowd throws flowers at SpongeBob]


[In SpongeBob's house, he is looking at himself in the mirror trying to look strong]
SpongeBob: It's time to grow myself large and wide.
[He grows himself large and wide as he is saying it. Walks over to his weight, which is a pink bunny and a blue bear and has trouble lifting it, but manages to get it over his head anyway. The doorbell rings and SpongeBob opens door]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?
SpongeBob: Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumpin' iron. Check it out. [shows off his muscles, but is still a weakling]
Sandy: Well, you're smelly.
SpongeBob: All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. [shows all sorts of stuffed animals]
Sandy: Uhh... I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob, but you won't see any progress with those.
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Sandy: That is, if you want arms like these... [rolls up right sleeve, and flexes her right arm, showing off a big, impressive bicep] ...or these... [rolls up other sleeve and flexes left arm, revealing her other bicep] ...or these! [shows off her powerful back muscles while executing a back double bicep flex. SpongeBob's arm wiggles in the air]
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.
Sandy: Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? That'd be great, Sandy. I can see me now. [imagines himself with muscles and very tall working at the Krusty Krab, then he is jellyfishing at Jellyfish Fields] La-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la. [at night, SpongeBob seems too big for his bed] Goodnight, Gary.
Gary: Meow. [cut back to the present]
SpongeBob: Yeah... that would change everything!
Sandy: Be at my place at 5 a.m. Oh! And you'll need a water helmet. [puts a fish bowl on his head. Now the scene cuts to Sandy's tree dome, where SpongeBob is trying to do push-ups] Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups! Come on. Come on! You can do it! [SpongeBob is grunting at this point determined to get a push-up. His body cracks and falls down while his arms stay up]
SpongeBob: One. [acorn bell dings]
Sandy: [in boxing ring with gloves on] Alright, put 'em up!
SpongeBob: [struggles getting his gloves up] They're up.
Sandy: Ding ding! [punches SpongeBob out of the ring. Later, Sandy starts up her exercise wheel with SpongeBob on it. SpongeBob pants while the wheel goes faster and makes him trip all over the wheel] Feeling the burn?
SpongeBob: I'm! Fee!! Ling!!! Some!!!! Thing!!!!! [launches out of the wheel and into the tree dome glass]
Sandy: Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm-cruncher.
SpongeBob: Arm-cruncher, great... [looks over and sees two cement blocks slamming into the cement pedestal] This squirrel's trying to kill me.
Sandy: [walks up to the arm-cruncher with phone in hand] This is it.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's great, Sandy, well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye. [hangs up] This working-out thing, isn't working out. [arms bulge in and out] Ow. Ow. Ow.
Shark: [on TV] Hey! Hey, you! Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! "Oh, I'm a little peanut worm." Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Shark: With Anchor arms! [puts a long pink blow-up item on his arm] They slip on like a glove. Just add air. [puts a plug in the arm's hole and pumps air into it] How big do you want 'em? [pumps air into other arm] Normal? [puts more air into arm] Veiny!? And for the ladies... [puts air into arm which makes it grow hair] ...hairy. [SpongeBob whistles as the TV puts up an image of a weak shark] I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk, and everybody loves me! So order now, wimp!
SpongeBob: Wow, now that's a good idea!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone! [later, a big shadow of SpongeBob is walking down the road past Squidward, who is licking a popsicle] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [Tongue stuck to popsicle while looking up.] SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: [Next scene is Mr. Krabs sweeping the outside of the Krusty Krab. He looks up.] Huh!?
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!!
Mr. Krabs: Mother of pearl! [hides in the Krusty Krab. Now, at Mussel Beach where everyone is lifting weights. SpongeBob comes in and makes one guy drop a big weight on two others' feet]
Fish: Owww...
SpongeBob: Hi, guys. [shows off new muscles]
Larry: SpongeBob, is that you!?
SpongeBob: [walking on his hands] Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait... wait... [flexes those muscles] They're big, aren't they?
Larry: Dude, you're ripped!
SpongeBob: [flexes out the words...] THANK YOU. I've been working out. Excuse me a second. [flexes more] Yeah. Anyone up for the... [flexes muscles into drinks] ...juice bar? [bubble transition to juice bar]
Scooter: I'm tellin' ya, he's huge!
Sandy: Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?
Scooter: You mean 'MuscleBob BuffPants'? He's in there! [points to inside of bar]
Sandy: Uhh, whatever. Thanks.
SpongeBob: [now inside]I start off with twenty raw eggs everyday. But that's just me.
Sandy: Pardon me.
SpongeBob: Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there! [points to weak fish]
Fish: Who, me? [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: I remember when I used to look like you, too. [points to Larry and laughs] But, that was a long time ago.
Bartender: Here's your drink, sir.
SpongeBob: Thank you. [tries to lift up drink but can't so he stretches his mouth out to the straw and drinks] Yeah...
Sandy: SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?
SpongeBob: I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results. [anchor arm almost slips off] Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better.
Sandy: Heck, what's your secret?
SpongeBob: What?
Sandy: Your secret workout. What is it? [everyone wants to know and looks over at SpongeBob. SpongeBob thinks of something nervously and quickly.]
SpongeBob: Hmmm... well... I, uhh... first I... take my hand... and I do this. [makes armpit noises]
Larry: Are you kidding?
SpongeBob: Do these muscles lie? [flexes muscles into a shape of a sponge. Everyone starts making armpit noises]
Sandy: I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you.
SpongeBob: Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.
Sandy: Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test.
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you mean?
Sandy: The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today! Everybody'll be there!
Bartender: Here's your drink. [sets drink on SpongeBob's anchor-arm hand and it sinks down]
Sandy: Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!
SpongeBob: Uhh, well, I'm not sure.
Sandy: C'mon, let's go.
SpongeBob: Right now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a... [tries to run away but the drink is holding him back. Tries lifting the drink but is unsuccessful] Sandy, wait!
Sandy: Here it is-- the sign-in list.
SpongeBob: Oh, no.
Sandy: [signs her name on a piece of paper] Okay, Sannnndy... Cheeks. [puts the paper into entry box]
SpongeBob: [still struggling] Wait, Sandy... don't sign just yet!
[Sandy puts the paper in the box]
SpongeBob: Wait-!
Sandy: Okay...
SpongeBob: [struggles even harder] WAAAAIT!
Sandy: [signs names] SpongeBobbbb SquaaaarePaaaants. [the bartender lifts the drink off of SpongeBob, which sends him flying towards Sandy]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait...! [slams into pole]
Sandy: It's okay, SpongeBob, I already signed your name in.
SpongeBob: Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy. [at the competition]
Announcer: We on? Welcome to the Goo Lagoon 8th annual anchor toss competition. [everyone is getting ready but SpongeBob is nervous]
Sandy: Ready, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Great. No problem. [blows frantically into his Anchor Arms]
Announcer: Could I get some mustard on that? Oh. First up, Don the Whale. [Don throws the anchor and it lands. A measurer fish dashes up to measure distance]
Measurer: 200 yards! [the crowd cheers]
Announcer: Let's see an instant-replay. [another anchor comes flying in on top of the measurer and hits him.] Amazing! Up next, Larry the Lobster. [Larry throws his anchor. The measurer shrieks at the incoming anchor, and runs aside from getting hit; however, the anchor's shadow covers the measurer and crushes him once again]
Measurer: 210 yards!!
Announcer: Here goes, Sandy Cheeks. [Sandy throws it up in the air and kicks it away. The measurer runs around, trying to avoid getting hit by the anchor, but the anchor crushes him anyway]
Measurer: 510 yaaaards!!!
Announcer: Wow! Fabulous!
Sandy: Beat that, SpongeBob!
Announcer: Up next: SpongeBob SquarePants!
Crowd: [imitating the armpit exercise while others are holding up SpongeBob signs and chanting] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tries to pull the anchor but instead he falls under the ground with the anchor and comes out and laughs] Just kidding. Just kidding... heh! [everyone laughs]
Sandy: That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn!
SpongeBob: [to himself] Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp! I'm a jerk!!
[SpongeBob blows his Anchor Arms over the "JERK" size]
SpongeBob: [the crowd goes berserk in cheering] Yeah.
[SpongeBob tries to lift the anchor again but when he tries too hard, some of the air in one arm goes into SpongeBob's nose. Tries to lift again, but the air goes into his left eye as the crowd "ooh"s. SpongeBob tries to lift again and causes the air to go into his left tooth]
Crowd: [chanting] SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob tries to lift again the last time, causing the Anchor Arms to burst around his body, then explode. After the air blows off, the popped Anchor Arms deflate, floating down.]
Crowd Attendee: Ooh, I think he lost. [crowd chants for Sandy] Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! [SpongeBob then reveals his real arms hidden from inside his body. Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and taps her foot, disappointed. SpongeBob walks away, leaving his destroyed Anchor Arms on the ground and follows Sandy to the Treedome]
SpongeBob: 96... 97... 98... 99... 100.
Sandy: I want 100 more.
SpongeBob: It hurts. [changes channel over and over] 1. 2. 3. 4...
Sandy: I think we finally found an exercise for you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: ...9. 10. [his arm falls off] Can you get that?


Squidward: [talking to a wax sculpture of himself] Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eyes...a little lopsided. [takes out the right eye, fixes it then puts it back in place] There. And now that I've been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile! [Squidward makes wax sculpture smile. Then he hears a crash from outside and frowns; the sculpture does as well]
SpongeBob: Hike, Patrick, hike! [both run in separate directions but SpongeBob has a big rock. Drops the rock on the ground and it breaks in half while Patrick blows a chess piece across a chessboard] You just lost three points. [climbs a tree branch] One. Two. Five! [flips upside down and blows a bubble into a shape] G-7!
Patrick: G-7? King me! King me! [runs into the coral branch and pops the bubble] I lose!
SpongeBob: But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.
Patrick: Tartar sauce! [Squidward peeks out]
Squidward: Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: We don't know.
Squidward: Hey, Patrick, do you know what time it is?
Patrick: Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's... [checks his watch but all the bubble soap leaks out when he turns his wrist around]
Squidward: Time to find some other game to play! [laughs. Turns on the record player while taking a bubble bath]
SpongeBob: Now what?
Patrick: [notices a shell on the ground] We could toss that shell back and forth.
SpongeBob: [picks up shell] Okay... ready! [throws shell into Patrick's belly. Patrick shoots it into the air]
Patrick: Go! [SpongeBob goes after it]
SpongeBob: I got it! I got it! [the shell flies through Squid's open window, knocks into Squid's sculpture, and it falls over] I got it! I got it! I got it! [Squid in the other room, hears a thump, but he ignores it. Sponge and Pat enter the room via the elevator] Remember, Patrick, finders keepers.
Patrick: There it is! [points to the shell that is in the wax sculpture of Squidward]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: I got it! I got it! [Patrick pulls the shell out]
Patrick: Bonus points! [Patrick starts to walk off]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.
Patrick: Don't worry. I know how to do this. [Patrick tries to give CPR, but his face turns blue and he floats up to the ceiling but lets out all the air and lands on top of the wax sculpture's head]
SpongeBob: Get off him, Patrick! [Patrick stands up]
Patrick: What are you worried about? [Patrick's butt is now imprinted on the sculpture's face] He looks better already. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick stand him up]
SpongeBob: But he still feels cold.
Patrick: Well, let's go put him in the warm. [they bring the sculpture in front of the window with the sun shining through it]
SpongeBob: Do you think he'll be okay?
Patrick: You know, you worry too much. [the sculpture begins to melt] The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe... [starts to drool as SpongeBob snaps his fingers] ...me. Hey, what's that on your shoe? [SpongeBob looks down]
SpongeBob: I don't know.
Patrick: It kind of looks like... [a liquid puddle of green goo is on the floor]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Squidward! [both are screaming as Squidward is powdering his nose]
SpongeBob: No, no, that part goes here.
Patrick: Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh.
SpongeBob: We're almost there. We can do this.
Patrick: It's working, it's working...
SpongeBob: This is working. [sculpture melts again] Patrick, this isn't working!
Patrick: Look! [eyes turn over]
SpongeBob: I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!
Patrick: Oh, I thought he was dead. [Squidward comes out of the bathroom covered in talcum powder. SpongeBob &amp; Patrick cling to each other and get scared]
Squidward: [screams] What are you doing here?! Well? Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?
SpongeBob: No, stay back!
Squidward: What is the matter with you two?
Patrick: Don't, don't hurt us!
SpongeBob: It was an accident!
Squidward: What are you two talking about? [he notices the goo on the floor and screams] Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll...
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost! [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are bowing before Squidward] Spare us your ghostly anger! [Patrick is kissing Squidward's feet]
Patrick: Oh, yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!
SpongeBob: We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us! [Squidward then gets an idea and grins evilly]
Squidward: Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.
SpongeBob: Does that include...
Squidward: Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!
Patrick: [whispers to SpongeBob] I think they make a cream for that now. [SpongeBob and Patrick carry out Squidward on his bed]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Too hot. [walk a little more then stops]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going. [walks a little more then stops]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Toulouse-Lautrec. [rim shot]
SpongeBob: Too tired... [both stop where they are]
Squidward: Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy. [claps his hands] Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.
SpongeBob: Only the freshest, o spooky one. [both run off. SpongeBob comes back with grapes] A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness. [Squidward eats it while SpongeBob goes and gets a banana] A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness. [squeezes it into Squidward's mouth. Patrick comes back with a watermelon]
Patrick: One watermelon... [drops it into Squidward's mouth, who keels over due to the weight] Fresh from the manure fields, your spookiness. [on the ground, Squidward's head is shaped like the watermelon]
SpongeBob: Art thou not pleased? [Squidward spits out the watermelon]
Squidward&#160;: Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.
Patrick&#160;: What do you hunger for, master?
SpongeBob: Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.
Squidward: Cherry pie. [Patrick holds up a cherry pie] Where'd you get that?
Patrick: I found it. [Squidward takes it and throws it somewhere]
Squidward: Well, go find it again! [Patrick goes searching for it] SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around. [SpongeBob turns around] That's better. Now jog in place. [SpongeBob jogs in place] Say "flank steak".
SpongeBob: Flank steak.
Squidward: I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop. [SpongeBob stops] Now, play me an elaborate song with this! [gives SpongeBob a tissue]
SpongeBob: But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
Squidward: Oh, my. Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo. [SpongeBob blows through the tissue to try and get it to make music]
SpongeBob: I can't do it!
Squidward: Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, 'cause you're not allowed to leave that spot till I hear a song. [walks away. Day turns into night and into day again and SpongeBob is lying on the ground with the tissue on his nose] What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.
Patrick: [comes back with the pie] I found it. [Squidward takes it]
Squidward: I'll take that! [throws pie in Patrick's face]
Patrick: Yes, your ghostliness! [licks filling off his face] This is fun.
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you ready for this?
Patrick: Yes. [SpongeBob walks a couple steps forward]
SpongeBob: Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming? [Patrick is facing the wrong way]
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's this way.
Patrick: Where?
SpongeBob: Here.
Patrick: [turns around] Oh, coming! [both enter a room in the back with a bunch of junk in it] How are we going to clean up all this mess?
SpongeBob: It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off! [tears the wall]
Patrick: [laughs] Oh look, you missed some. [SpongeBob picks up a book]
SpongeBob: Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman. [shows picture in the book] It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?
Patrick: We're going to go shopping?
SpongeBob: No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest. [Squidward is laying on the couch, SpongeBob &amp; Patrick spit spitballs at him]
Squidward: Ow! What the heck was that?
SpongeBob: Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
Squidward: Ceremony for what?
SpongeBob: We're going to put you to rest.
Squidward: I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Oh, really? I'm going to go check. [walks off. Opens door and screams because he sees Patrick &amp; SpongeBob with a coffin]
SpongeBob: Okay, get in.
Squidward: Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing!
SpongeBob: But you said we could put you to rest.
Squidward: I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick outside ]
Squidward: Now what? [Squidward sees SpongeBob writing on a tombstone]
SpongeBob: I wrote "Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but he..." [Squidward screams] Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough?
Squidward: SpongeBob! Cut that out!
SpongeBob: Oh, look, the mourners have arrived. [a bus with a load of people are in front of Squidward's house]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?
SpongeBob: No, just into this hole.
Squidward: [Groans then sighs] SpongeBob, I have a confession to make. [Takes off his night cap]
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're bald?
Squidward&#160;: No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!
SpongeBob: But-
Squidward: Do it!
SpongeBob: Go home. [People get back on bus sadly] But I, Master--
Squidward: I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and stop doing me favors! [walks off]
SpongeBob: As you wish, master.
Squidward: D'oh!
Patrick: Boy, he really had us fooled.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.
Patrick: You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.
SpongeBob: Patrick, say that again.
Patrick: That again?
SpongeBob: No, the other thing.
Patrick: No, the other thing.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] No, what you said before when you...
Patrick: No, what you said before when you...
SpongeBob: Never mind! I've got an idea.
Patrick: Never mind! I've got an idea. [SpongeBob gets annoyed again. Later, Squidward is reclining on his chair outside. SpongeBob is trying to blow a bubble big enough to get Squidward]
SpongeBob: I can't reach him!
Patrick: Blow harder! [SpongeBob blows a big bubble to consume Squidward. The bubble lifts Squidward gently from his chair. The octopus doesn't notice that he's floating.] There he goes!
SpongeBob: Isn't he beautiful?
Patrick: How high's he going to go? [Squidward sees he's floating]
SpongeBob: All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond. [both of them wave to Squidward] Goodbye, friend!
Patrick: Happy trails! [Squidward pounds his fists on the bubble and tries to yell, but his voice is so distorted by the soapy wall that unintelligible muffled noises come through.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: He's on the other side now.
Patrick: Yeah. [Squidward is floating above the sea at Bikini Atoll island in a bubble] He's in a better place. [Squidward moans in the bubble with seagulls flying around him]


[At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is sniffing a Krabby Patty, then squirts a mustard "checkmark" on the patty and puts on the bun. Just then, SpongeBob hears Pearl come in crying. SpongeBob gets a pan and puts it on top of his head for protection from the tears.]
Mr. Krabs: Don't cry, love. Daddy's going to make it all right. Calm down, girl! [a wave of water from the tears busts the door down, but SpongeBob pushes the door back up for a couple seconds, then the water comes breaking through the door and wipes out all the customers, dropping them to the floor. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs with part of a table around his face]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?
Mr. Krabs: Her scurvy prom date stood her up, boy, and now, she can't seem to find another.
Pearl: That's because there's only one fish in the sea that's long, tan and handsome as he is. And that's him!
Mr. Krabs: No, no, baby, no more crying. We'll get you a date. Why, uhh... I'll take ya! [Pearl begins to cry and an earthquake starts] Well, what about Squidward? [Squidward is filing his tentacles. Pearl cries even harder and makes the earthquake even worse]
Mr. Krabs: Wait, wait. Here, take SpongeBob!
Pearl: Ahh! the fry cook? Do you know what that would do to my complexion? People would mistake me for a planetarium.
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
Pearl: I don't know. But I can't take him, daddy! They'll kick me off the most frequently pictured in the yearbook committee.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, they would. We've got to find someone else. Listen up! Which one of you lucky lubbers wants to take me lovely daughter Pearl to the prom? [everyone runs away]
Pearl: Just don't be late, SpongeBob. [sadly walks off]
Mr. Krabs: Now listen, boy, I'm-a counting on you to make this a very special night for a very special girl. Remember, you're doing it for good old Mr... [the real SpongeBob walks up behind him]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It's pretty realistic isn't it? [holds up the left arm] I made this part out of...
Mr. Krabs: Never mind that, boy! You're taking Pearl to her prom!
SpongeBob: Really? Oh, wow! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert! [now at home] Oh, Gary, I'm a prom failure. I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What is it, Gary? What do you have? [Gary hides in his shell while SpongeBob takes out a magazine from Gary's shell. Magazine is 'Long Tan and Handsome'] Hey, Gary, this magazine gives me an idea! [SpongeBob cuts through some black fabric then sews it up. Then he takes a shower and plucks his eyebrows to put in some new ones. Then he plants some seeds into the tuxedo and waters it to grow a pink flower. Now, he ties his shoes which are on stilts] Long. [pops out of a toaster as some bread] Tan. [licks his two front teeth that are braced up] Handsome. Okay, Gary, wait ‘til Pearl gets an eyeful of this! [Gary hides in his shell. Later, SpongeBob's limo drives up to Mr. Krabs house. SpongeBob rings the door bell and Mr. Krabs opens the door]
Mr. Krabs: Hello? [SpongeBob lowers himself by some sort of crank] What do you think, Pearl? Cleans up pretty well, doesn't he?
Pearl: [wearing a pink dress] Well, at last no one will recognize you. Now listen, SpongeBob, I just want to get through this with my social status intact. [SpongeBob writes down a list of what Pearl wants to do on a notepad] I want to go to the prom, get my picture taken, and I want to dance... [SpongeBob has a big list now] ...I want to drink punch with my friends and don't do that other thing you're always doing...
SpongeBob: Uhh, Pearl, we've got to get back to the limo.
Pearl: [claps] A limo! Why didn't you say so? [Pearl grabs SpongeBob and drags him out of the house] I love limousines!
Mr. Krabs: Go easy on him, lassie! I can't afford to break in a new fry cook! [laughs and closes the door. Now at the prom where the limo is driving up, but the back wheels are flat so it is screeching on the road]
SpongeBob: [checks his list] Well, I guess the first thing we should do is... [flash goes off where the pictures are being held]
Pearl: Yay! My first prom picture!
SpongeBob: Uh-uh-uh... our first prom picture. [Pearl sprays him with something that deflates his arm]
Pearl: Let's get this over with. [SpongeBob is having trouble getting over to the photo-shoot] Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Be right there.
Pearl: Will you hurry up?
SpongeBob: Just a second. Coming! [SpongeBob messes up his footing and jumps everywhere and apologizes to everyone but eventually gets to the photo-shoot. He holds onto the curtain to keep his balance] Sorry! Pardon me! Here I am...! Cheese...! [curtain collapses on them and the photo is taken] That'll be a keeper.
Judy: Hey, look, it's Pearl! Hi, Pearl!
Pearl: SpongeBob, here come my friends. Uhh, go get me some punch!
SpongeBob: Prom expert; away! [jumps away as Pearl's friends walk up to her]
Judy &amp; Friend: Hi, Pearl!
Pearl: Hi, girls.
Judy: I'd like you to meet Billy Fishkins!
Billy: Meep.
Friend: And you know Brian Flounder from math class.
Brian: Meep.
Pearl: Hi Brian.
Friend: So, like, where's your date, Pearl? We're all dying to meet him.
Pearl: He's over at the punch bowl getting me some punch. [friend looks for SpongeBob]
Judy: Ohh, is he the really tall one?
Pearl: Oh, yes! [notices what SpongeBob is doing] I mean... Oh no. [SpongeBob is trying to reach for the spoon to get some punch, but can't reach because he is too tall, the spoon is alive. He misplaces his footing and gets the punch all over him. Pearl pushes her friends away] Oh, quick, let's go see how ugly Cindy's dress is! [SpongeBob hands two glasses of punch to some people] SpongeBob, what are you doing?! [SpongeBob has red skin now from the punch. He squeezes some juice from his nose and into the glass]
SpongeBob: Hi, Pearl! Come on, it won't bite!
Pearl: You look ridiculous! [gasps]
SpongeBob: What is it? [Pearl pushes him under the table]
Pearl: Get down, he'll see us! It's my ex-boyfriend, Octavius Rex, a.k.a. long, tan and handsome!
Octavius: Meep.
SpongeBob: Whoa. But, I bet he isn't holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy! [holds it up, but another guy takes it away because it's his]
Anchovy: Give me that back.
SpongeBob: [giggles] That just didn't happen. Let's go! [takes Pearl to the dance floor] Ready? [dances like crazy]
Pearl: SpongeBob, what are you doing? Can't you see everybody here is doing 'the whack'? [the couples are jumping at each other with their chests. We see couples jumping up and hitting each other]
SpongeBob: The whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one. [tries to jump]
Pearl: Are you sure you can do this? [SpongeBob jumps at Pearl, but they hit another couple and send them flying through the food table, shattering food and kitchenware. One of the people crash through a fruit painting]
Painter: Aaah! a monster! [jumps into a trash can which makes everyone else scream and go crazy]
Pearl: Well, I guess you can take me home now, now that you've ruined everything! [cries]
SpongeBob: Don't cry, the prom expert is here! I haven't failed yet! [looks through the list he wrote down] Hey, we can still... no, I broke that. We could... no. Don't cry! D-d-don't cry. [At this point, SpongeBob seems to be talking to himself more than he is to Pearl.] Whatever you do, don't... [cries, runs off]
Judy: Wow, what did you do to him? Poor little guy. [SpongeBob runs into the ladie’s bathroom. A couple girls run off screaming]
Pearl: [walks up outside the ladies restroom] Sponge, are you okay?
SpongeBob: [crying] — Messed everything up.
Pearl: Don't worry, SpongeBob, ya didn't mess everything up.
SpongeBob: [crying] — Hot dog!
Pearl: Actually, it was pretty funny when that hot dog landed in Judy's hair.
SpongeBob: [crying] All I wanted was to have a good time!
Pearl: But I am having a good time! Ya know, we haven't finished our dance yet.
SpongeBob: [whimpers] Can I still wear the wig?
Pearl: Yes, you can still wear the wig. [SpongeBob runs out and grabs Pearl to the dance floor]
SpongeBob: Let's go!
♪All right, you invertebrates. I'm gonna teach you how to do The Sponge. Well, first you take your leg and you stick it in the air, And then you take the other one and jam it right up there, You twist yourself around and give a great big lunge, Now you're doin' The Sponge. Huh, do The Sponge, Sponge, oh do The Sponge, Beat your buns you're doin' The Sponge. Well, now, first you take your leg And you stick it in the air, And then you take the other one, And you jam it right up there, You twist yourself around And you give a great big lunge, Now you're doin', yeah, now you're doin' The Sponge.♪
Pearl: [Octavius Rex walks up to Pearl] Get lost, pizza topping! Can't you see I'm doing the Sponge? [People are still breaking stuff and running around screaming, an old lady is tied up with two men, two men crash into themselves, their heads are upside down as the paramedics run out carrying people out on their stretcher. Some are hurt and crying. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Pearl are still dancing. Pearl takes SpongeBob and wraps him into a basketball. Shoots and the word "score" lights up on the scoreboard. Angry people from the prom pick up both SpongeBob and Pearl and carry them over to the door]
Angry crowd: Get out!
SpongeBob &amp; Pearl: They love us! Yay, we're popular! [Both thrown out of the gym]
Angry crowd: And don't come back!
Long, tan and handsome Anchovy leader: Go wreck someone else's prom, will ya? [Goes back inside gym. Later, SpongeBob and Pearl walking up to her house]
SpongeBob: Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned.
Pearl: Oh, don't worry, SpongeBob, I knew it would be a total disaster all along. But as long as disasters go, that was really fun. [Mr. Krabs opens up the door]
Mr. Krabs: A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower! [Pearl gasps] You almost stepped on it. [rakes the flower in the ground. SpongeBob froze in his spot]
Pearl: Oh, daddy! Well, good night, short, yellow and spongy. SpongeBob? [shrugs her shoulders and walks back inside]
Mr. Krabs: Good job, laddie. [winks at him and goes back inside. The real SpongeBob appears from the side]
SpongeBob: Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! [laughs].


SpongeBob: [Gary is on his exercise wheel] Exercise time is over, Gary. [takes Gary off his wheel] We don't want you getting too thin. [holds up a green, squishy ball] Here, boy. Fetch! [throws it and Gary goes after it but at a slow pace. SpongeBob checks his watch and sits on a chair and takes out the newspaper to read. Morning arrives, the rooster crows and SpongeBob is asleep in the chair. Gary crawls up to SpongeBob and spits out the ball]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? [sees the ball on the ground]  Good job, Gary! [He jumps to Gary] I love you, Gary! [He starts scratching Gary and Gary purrs] Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary! [Gary climbs up on SpongeBob, purring and tickling him] Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha! [Patrick comes through the door]
Patrick: SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
SpongeBob: For what?
Patrick: The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend! [shows his jellyfishing net off until he breaks something and blushes with embarrassment] So, you ready or what?
SpongeBob: That was this weekend? [He looks up at Gary who's still crawling all over him trying to tickle him] I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
[There's a knock on the door. Squidward is seen outside. The door opens, but the first thing Squidward sees is Gary on SpongeBob's head. He looks down at SpongeBob and reveals a pair of underwear.]
Squidward: Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
Squidward: What's a Gary?
SpongeBob: Not a Gary. Gary. He's my pet snail. [shows Gary to Squidward] Say hello! [Gary hisses at Squidward and drools]
Squidward: Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
SpongeBob: I love Gary!
Squidward: Well, I don't. Get somebody else. [walks off]
SpongeBob: I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick. [Squidward stops]
Squidward: Go away? [walks in reverse back to SpongeBob's Pineapple] You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
SpongeBob: Actually, a three day weekend.
Squidward: As in, not here for three days?
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.
Patrick: Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
Squidward: I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
SpongeBob: You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk.[SpongeBob explains the daily routine with Gary, but Squidward is busy thinking of how much fun he'll have with SpongeBob &amp; Patrick away]
Squidward: Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend.
SpongeBob: Let me show you how to feed him. [opens a cabinet with six barrels of Gary's food] The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
Squidward: Sure it's enough? [bus drives up to the pineapple with other jellyfishers inside]
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Patrick: The bus is here! The bus is here! [crashes through the wall and through the bus leaving his starfish shape through each hole] C'mon, SpongeBob!
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Squidward: [pushing SpongeBob out of the house] Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye bye.
SpongeBob: Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
Squidward: I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.
SpongeBob: Gary.
Squidward: Right, yeah, right. [bus drives off] Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers! [laughs with joy] They're gone! [runs inside his Easter Island Head. Gary peeks his eyes out the window]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: [comes out with shorts on and his nose with sunscreen on it and a chair. Unfolds the chair and sits on it] This is going to be the best three days of my life. [sighs and lays back with a sun reflector in front of him] I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob. [The time card "3 Days Later" appears, and now Squidward is badly sunburned, The bus comes back as the group is chanting "jellyfishing"] Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me. [Squidward sees Gary through the window. Gary groans. Squidward's sunburn drains] [screams] The snail! I forgot the snail! [runs inside the pineapple where Gary is old and withered on the floor. Squidward frantically takes him inside to the kitchen] I've got to do something. [takes all the barrels of food and puts it in his bowl] Okay, okay, okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here. [Squidward frantically throws the food at Gary's trying to get him to eat it] [Gary lip syncing what Squidward's saying]: Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat! You've gotta finish this food!
SpongeBob: See you later, Patrick.
Squidward: Come on, eat! Eat! Eat! [SpongeBob gets his house key out. Squidward has to decide about the food] Ohh...
SpongeBob: [sticks the key in the hole and opens the door] Gary! I'm home!
Squidward: [greets SpongeBob with a head full of Gary's food that he ate] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Squidward! What are you doing here? [Squidward swallows all the food]
Squidward: Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
SpongeBob: What a great friend you are, Squidward.
Squidward: So, uhh, well, see you. Goodbye.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. [Gary crawls to SpongeBob, still old and wrinkly] I can always count on you. [Gary moans and SpongeBob screams] Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward! [Squidward frowns ‘cause he can't leave. Later, the doctors snail-mobile is in front of the pineapple]
Brock: Yes, yes, it's just as I thought.
SpongeBob: What?
Brock: This is definitely a snail.
SpongeBob: I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that?
Brock: Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered. Here you go. [hands the shot to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Aren't you going to do it?
Brock: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm too squeamish. [doctor leaves. Squidward runs after him]
Squidward: Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.
Squidward: Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do... [Gary moans and coughs badly]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: Okay, okay, I'll do it. [takes the shot]
SpongeBob: Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady. [Squidward tries to give Gary the shot but SpongeBob pulls him away] Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again. [Squidward keeps trying but gets the same result every time]
Squidward: Will you hold him still? [snail plasma shot in SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.
Squidward: Well, you made me do it!
SpongeBob: What's going to happen to me?
Squidward: Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.
SpongeBob: I don't know, I feel kind of funny!
Squidward: I'm telling you, it's all in your head. [Gary crawls to his water bowl to get a drink. After drinking the water, he gargles, clears his throat, and meows normally again.]
Squidward: He just needed water?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you're better! [hugs him]
Squidward: Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
Squidward: Trust me, SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine. [closes door]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
Gary: [jumps up] Meow! [SpongeBob pours food into Gary's bowl, but decides to see what it tastes like. He likes it so he eats all of it. Then walks to Gary with the empty bowl]
SpongeBob: Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself. [burps] Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top! [SpongeBob begins to walk out of the kitchen. His feet make loud pounding noises as they hit the floor, and he begins to go slower and slower. Soon Gary is going faster than he is.]
SpongeBob: Gary, you're getting a [voice slows, lowers] lot faster! [SpongeBob sluggishly walks into the bathroom, and Gary follows him. He looks in the mirror, and his voice echoes as he speaks.]
SpongeBob:  Look at me. Never better. [He yelps as dramatic music begins to play in the background. His head begins to throb, and his pores begin to grow and shrink, before returning to normal.] I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine! [What he doesn't realize is that the worst is yet to come. His eyes bug out of his head, causing him to yell. The camera rotates around so we can get a side view of SpongeBob. He blinks, and his eyes briefly pop back into his head and return to normal. But this relief only lasts for about half a second. Then, his eyes bulge out even farther than before, and it looks very unnatural. They bulge for a while, and then they begin to transform, taking the shape and form of snail's eyes, with stalks. The sight causes SpongeBob's jaw to drop, and he screams louder. SpongeBob stares in the bathroom mirror at his brand-new eyestalks, which now have skin and eyelids around them. He turns to Gary.]
SpongeBob:  Gary... I'm fine! [But SpongeBob is not fine. Gary watches in horror as his owner falls onto his hands and knees, straining in pain.]
SpongeBob:  [in so much pain that he is barely comprehensible] Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see. [grunts and strains as his hand and arm slowly retract into his sleeve, which then pops off and bounces away] That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway! [Then, SpongeBob's feet and legs retract into his pants.]
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Ha! Now I don't have to buy those new shoes! [his body shortens up like a snail and he screams] I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeee [he loses the ability to talk and completes his snail transformation] ow!
Squidward: [in his bed with his clarinet] I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary. [a knock is heard on the door and the doorbell rings] Who could that be? As if I didn't already know. [Camera goes to Squidward’s front door. Squidward turns on the light, walks to the door, and opens it] SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just-- [attempts to say “fine,” but hesitates and shouts almost hysterically. SpongeBob is now a fully breaded snail.]
SpongeBob: Meow!
Squidward: [screams]
SpongeBob: Meow! Meow. [Squidward touches SpongeBob's left eye and it curls up]
Squidward: [screams and runs back inside shutting the door]
Squidward: SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done? [picks up the snail plasma shot] It's all your fault. [throws it away] Okay, okay, okay, okay, get it together, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Meow! [Squidward screams and puts boards on his door. Turns around and SpongeBob is at his window] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams] Meow! [Squidward puts more boards on his window, but SpongeBob squeezes through the boards holes] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams and runs into his closet]
Squidward: None of this would be happening if I'd only fed that snail! [SpongeBob squeezes in from under the door, and meows. Squidward screams and runs through his door, SpongeBob meows, Squidward runs up and down his ceiling, screaming and mumbling, while SpongeBob keeps meowing at him. Outside, his house is bouncing from side to side until it flips on its side completely. Everything is broken and torn inside. Squidward sits up, but is injected with the snail plasma through his nose]
Squidward: Uh-oh! [now SpongeBob, Squidward, and Gary are on a fence singing "Blow the Man Down"]
Gary: Meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A], meow [F] .
SpongeBob: Meow [A], meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A] .
Squidward: Meow [C], meow [D], meow [B♭], meow [A], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Gary: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G], meow [E] .
SpongeBob: Meow [G], meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Squidward: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [A], meow [G], meow [A], meow [F] .
Gary: [Off-screen] Meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A], meow [F] .
Patrick: [opens his rock. He is wearing pajamas] Will you clam up?! [throws a boot]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen at the same time] Meow [A], meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A] .
Squidward: Meow [C], me- [D] Ommf! [boot knocks him off the fence]
Gary: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G], meow [E] .
SpongeBob: Meow [G], meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Squidward: Meow [D], meow [D], meow [D], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A], meow [G], meow [A], meow [F].


[SpongeBob is lurking around, heading home, looking for Sandy because they are playing karate. He suspects the pineapple of being Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! Oh, sorry, pineapple house. I thought you were someone else. [walks inside] Ah, what a great day at work. [hears something] Huh? Yeah... [tip toes over to the couch, but makes duck sounds as he tip toes. He realizes he's been stepping on three squeaky toy ducks, and in frustration, he kicks them away. Then he runs in front of his couch] I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge... [jumps behind the couch and no one is there] ...Bob. [has his back to the couch while he squeezes his eyes through the couch looking for Sandy. When he thinks he has spotted her, he runs out from behind the couch and in front of the TV] I got you now! Hi-yah! [no one is there, so he sits on the couch and watches TV] Well, I guess the coast is clear.
TV: [shows a royal gramma fish] Yeah, shopping's weird. Did you ever go into the seafood aisle and say “Who eats this stuff"? [TV audience and SpongeBob laugh]
SpongeBob: I love this show! [Sandy is sitting next to SpongeBob]
Sandy: Me too! [SpongeBob screams and begins to fight]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [Sandy puts on her green karate gear]
Sandy: Hi-yah! [SpongeBob high-kicks in slow-motion]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [Sandy runs off then drives forward, but SpongeBob jumps his upper half of his body to avoid Sandy] Uhh, just a second. [runs off, but returns with his red karate gear on] Safety first! [he winks] And now, spin technique! [spins around and lunges towards Sandy]
Sandy: Hi-yah! Yah. [SpongeBob grabs her hand and spins her around]
SpongeBob: Double overhand squirrel knot! [turns her into a round knot and throws her through the door like a bowling ball]
Sandy: I'm gonna get you tomorrow, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: That'll be the day. [spins his arms and legs around. Pans over to nighttime at Sandy's treedome, when the phone rings]
Sandy: Hello? [SpongeBob's arm tries to karate chop Sandy, but Sandy takes SpongeBob's hand and puts it through the phone to karate chop himself] Nice try, SpongeBrain! [hangs up phone. Later, at Barg’N’Mart, Sandy is shopping when a box of Kelpo falls. She thinks it's SpongeBob, so she gets in her karate stance] Yah! [notices the box of Kelpo] Heh, silly me. [But when she walks a few more steps, SpongeBob is there in his karate gear]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?
Sandy: I don't think so.
SpongeBob: Well, it goes like this! [stretches his arm to ricochet off a shelf and the ceiling to come at Sandy] Oh, wait, I forgot the punch line. [His arm stops right before hitting Sandy] Oh, yeah! [hits the loose board on the floor, sending Sandy into a pile of tin cans] That's a good one, isn't it? [later, SpongeBob is walking down the road] What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful... [sees a pile of tin cans on the ground] pile of cans? Mmm, mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet. [He puts on karate gear]
Sandy: No it's not, SpongeBob. [shows him a squirrel mask] This is! [jumps in front of SpongeBob] Now, prepare for a long, merciless whooping! [grabs SpongeBob's tongue and takes out a bottle of hot sauce] Mmmm, my favorite.
[SpongeBob whimpers in fear as a drop of hot sauce hangs over the edge of the bottle and Tom Kenny's face appears on the drop]
Volcano Sauce Drop: Eheheheheheh! [cut to SpongeBob's confused face, and then back to the Volcano Sauce Drop] By the powers of naughtiness, I command this particular drop of hot sauce to be really... really... hot!
[SpongeBob gasps.]
SpongeBob: Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours.
Sandy: I knew you'd come to your senses, SpongeBob.
[Sandy drinks the bottle of hot sauce. While she is doing this, SpongeBob takes out his tongue revealing a label that says "Novelty Toy" and he wraps the fake tongue she was holding around her and spins her]
SpongeBob: Yah.
[Sandy karate chops SpongeBob far away]
Sandy: Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Curses! [Now at the Krusty Krab, the line is very long]
Customer: With extra cheese. To go!
Squidward: Three patties, four large oyster skins, on the double, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is still wearing his karate gear]
SpongeBob: Oh yeah. Gotcha! [SpongeBob opens a door]
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What? [karate chops Squidward's face]
Squidward: I'm going to pretend that didn't happen. [throws two pieces of paper at SpongeBob] Now fill these orders or leave, SpongeBob. We're very busy today! [SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen with tray of patties in his hands]
SpongeBob: Order up. [stops as he sees a customer karate chopping a fly. The customer turns into Sandy who is in her gear and winks at SpongeBob]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Now are you gonna... [SpongeBob throws the tray backwards at Squidward, causing the Krabby Patties to land on Squidward's head]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward. I was going through some records back in me office and--Huh? So, you got the hairpiece after all.
SpongeBob: Hi-yah!
Fred: [under the floor] My leg!
SpongeBob: Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! ‘Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this! [does something with his hands] Ssss! [Points at Fred, then walks backwards] Took care of her, yes I did. [bumps into Mr. Krabs] Oh, ahoy, sir!
Mr. Krabs: What was that?
SpongeBob: But, sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo.
Mr. Krabs: Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?
SpongeBob: No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it.
Mr. Krabs: Kara-tay? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward. [he walks off. Later, at closing time, Squidward is mopping the floor]
Squidward: SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet? [SpongeBob is staring at his hands]
SpongeBob: Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah!
Squidward: [frustrated] Go!
[SpongeBob walks into the bathroom with a mop and a bucket in his hands. He hears a sneeze, so he opens a door, but nobody is there]
SpongeBob: Hah! [opens the next stall door and jumps in it] Sandy! [Mr. Krabs walks out of the stall with SpongeBob in his hand]
Mr. Krabs: No more.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs grabs a hold of SpongeBob's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Shh! No more of this karate stuff, lad. Or you're fired. [lets go of his mouth and walks away]
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Fired? [walks out] No more karate? How am I gonna tell Sandy?
Sandy: Hi-yah! [jumps at SpongeBob and starts karate chopping him]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate.
Sandy: [stops] Uh-huh. Sure, SpongeBob. [Sandy karate chops him again]
SpongeBob: No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop.
Sandy: [stops] I'm not falling for it, SpongeBob! [karate chops him even more]
SpongeBob: No, really! Please, stop! [Mr. Krabs looks out the window]
Mr. Krabs: What the? [walks outside] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams]
SpongeBob: Ahh, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What did I just get through telling ye, lad?
SpongeBob: But I, uhh, she...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're fired!
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Fired? [his face gets smaller until it's not there anymore]
Mr. Krabs: Eh?
Sandy: SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's face reappears and he then bursts out crying and runs everywhere] Wait, Mr. Krabs, it's not his fault! It's- it's mine! He tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen! [SpongeBob is crying into a cup and drinking his tears. Now he's flipping over and over around Sandy and Mr. Krabs] Give him another chance, please?
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm. [grabs SpongeBob as he runs] Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind. [sniffs Sandy] Mmm, mammals. [walks off]
Sandy: Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing. [she and SpongeBob sigh] Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about [karate chops SpongeBob] this?
SpongeBob: [laughs, then suddenly stops] Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!
Sandy: We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.
SpongeBob: We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh. [picks up a rock] We can squeeze things! [squeezes the rock and drops it] Woo! How much fun was that?
Sandy: Almost some.
SpongeBob: I know! We can act like plants. [lies on the ground and opens and closes his legs and arms] Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.
Sandy: Wanna go to the park? [SpongeBob and Sandy are at the park. SpongeBob is holding a basket in one hand]
SpongeBob: Karate sure is dumb.
Sandy: Yeah, you can say that again.
SpongeBob: I feel dumb just thinking about it. [puts the basket down] Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!
Sandy: You like what?
SpongeBob: Not karate.
Sandy: Ha! I don't even know what that is.
SpongeBob: Me, too. I don't know what anything is! In fact...
Fisherman: [casting off his fishing rod] Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: [giggles] For a second, that sounded like.
Sandy: Karate?
SpongeBob: Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate? [opens up the basket] Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?
Sandy: Karate.
SpongeBob: What did you say?
Sandy: Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich. [takes out some mustard] There we go. [SpongeBob pulls out some barnacle loaf]
SpongeBob: How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?
Sandy: One. Just one.
SpongeBob: One for you! [karate chops a slice off]
Sandy: Hmmm?
SpongeBob: And one for me! [chops off another slice in slow-motion]
Sandy: Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hmm?
Sandy: Maybe just one more. Uhh, I'm kinda hungry.
[SpongeBob brings out the barnacle loaf again]
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Sandy. [lifts up his hand]
Sandy: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Sandy: Do you think, umm, do you think I could cut this one?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sure.
Sandy: Thanks. Hi-yah! [chops one slice] Is that enough?
SpongeBob: Maybe just one more. Or two!
Sandy: Or three!
SpongeBob: Or ten!
Sandy: Ten! Yes, ten! Because we're really hungry!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right! [chops off more slices and they fly everywhere]
SpongeBob: Time for buns! [throws a bunch of buns in the air and chops them in half]
Sandy: How about some tomatoes?
SpongeBob: And I'll cut the cheese! [both throw the cheese and tomatoes in the air while chopping them into a bunch of slices that land on the patties]
Sandy: And, what else should we slice? [SpongeBob grabs more buns]
SpongeBob: More buns!
Sandy: [Sandy grabs two heads of lettuce] And lettuce!
Both: Yeah! [both slice up more food to complete their Krabby Patties and one of the buns lands on an earthworm]
SpongeBob: Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy? [Sandy has a dazed look on her face] Right? I guess I'll eat one now. [reaches for a patty, but Sandy karate chops his arm with her green foam hand]
Sandy: You're mince meat!
SpongeBob: [in his red karate gear] In your dreams! Hi-yah! [both start to karate chop each other. Later, Mr. Krabs is walking through the park, carrying an umbrella]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? What the barnacle? [Everything in the park is chopped in half. Sandy is chopping wood while SpongeBob rests on a rock]
SpongeBob: Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate?
Mr. Krabs: [clearing his throat to get SpongeBob's attention]  Bleuhahugh!
SpongeBob: [screams] Mr. Krabs! [tries to hold a tree back in one piece] Uhh, hey, Mr. Krabs, how’s it going? [holds the rock in one piece] Nice day, huh? [half of the tree falls on SpongeBob's head] Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.
Mr. Krabs: Fire ya? [grabs a couple Krabby Patties] I've got something else in mind. [at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Sandy are karate chopping up Krabby Patties for the customers. Sandy is chopping up the meat and SpongeBob is chopping up the mustard]
Sandy: I love karate!
SpongeBob: I love kara-tay!
Mr. Krabs: I love money-ay! [He holds some money]
Squidward: I hate all of you.


SpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary. [takes off shoes and socks but socks still standing up but when SpongeBob throws them on the floor, the socks go down and Gary puts them on his eyes]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary. [pulls socks off Gary's eyes] You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. [snores and a dream cloud appears with the background of Krusty Krab stuff. SpongeBob eyes appear then his shoes and then his mouth on a rock] Hey! Over here! [laughs while his arms wiggle on the ground. Both arms attach to the rock and the rock moves over to the other items. SpongeBob's arms grab the eyes and puts them on the rock, his pants start appearing, and then his legs come out and put his shoes on and his body is seen. A car comes over SpongeBob and sits him in it. SpongeBob's nose grows out] Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! [driver's license appears] Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! [Car starts to move crazily] I sure take a good picture. [drives through a sign that says "Road Ends"] Darn! I should have grown a mustache. [the boat starts bumping up and down rapidly; SpongeBob is now driving off-road, hitting bumps in the sand; he smashes into a rock and flies out of the boat, still holding his license] How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. [flies over the Krusty Krab] Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. [Mrs. Puff floats up to him] Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
Mrs. Puff: [takes his license and tears it up] Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
SpongeBob: No! [flies through the dream cloud and on SpongeBob's real bed] Ouch! Where am I? [walks and looks up to his real self] Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
Gary: Meow. [snoring] Meow.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Gary's dream cloud] This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. [jumps into the dream cloud. He falls down into a library] Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. [walks past a pile of books] Gary! Huh? [sees Gary, who is now taller and wearing a cape, reading a book. He walks up to him] Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? [Gary turns around]
Gary: [gasps] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gary?
Gary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
SpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!
Gary: [sighs] In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Gary: Come. [they walk down an aisle of books] For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. [picks up a book and reads from it] "Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again." Emily Dickinson wrote that.
SpongeBob: Who?
Gary: [flips a few pages] Here's one you might know. [clears throat] There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
Gary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. [starts walking away]
Gary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
SpongeBob: [jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window] I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. [Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring. SpongeBob runs over] I can't resist! [laughs and jumps into the dream cloud. Inside, he opens a door to see Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride amidst the blank, white scenery] Hey, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [walks over] You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. [transforms into the shape of a skyscraper] Going up! Eh? [sees that Patrick is unresponsive and frowns, then perks up again] I can make... [changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself] A million of me! Eh? Eh?
Patrick: Yup. [the clones disappear] 
SpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. [leaves]
Patrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob. [kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away] Oh! [the quarter falls into a grate] Shoot, that was my last quarter. [sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good! [inflates himself with air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head] Psst! Squidward! [waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing] Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
King: Ahem! [sitting in the balcony above the stage] Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Squidward: Yes, Your Highness. [Squidward resumes playing, but SpongeBob tells the king a joke. The king laughs and Squidward stops playing again. He angrily stands up] SpongeBob!
King: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! [giggles, turns to SpongeBob and nudges him with his elbow] Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
Squidward: [growling, pressing down on his clarinet] Sponge- [accidentally breaks the clarinet. The audience gasps] Bob...
King: [angry] I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
Squidward: [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: [as a clarinet] Squidward! [points to himself and winks] Huh? Huh?
Squidward: [throws his broken clarinet pieces off-stage. Speaking with his back turned] No way.
King: Ahem! [glares down at Squidward]
Squidward: [sighs and picks SpongeBob up] Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.
SpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward. [Squidward blows into him]
SpongeBob: [off-key] La la! La la la la la la la! [The audience gasps again]
Squidward: [stops playing] SpongeBob!
King: [crying] Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
[Squidward smiles and SpongeBob winks at him]
SpongeBob: [continues singing off-key]
Fish: [crying] His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
[crowd cheers]
Squidward: [bowing] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [the crowd knocks him aside into a fruit wagon and a fish grabs SpongeBob]
Fish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
SpongeBob: [turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him. Squidward has climbed out of the wagon and is a mess] So long, Squidward! [Squidward starts to growl at him, but the audience members push him back into the fruit wagon and chase after SpongeBob. The King follows, too, laughing. SpongeBob runs out the door and flies away.]
Squidward: [starts tossing and turning in his bed, mumbling in angered pain]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands on the top of the tree dome] Hey! I'm at Sandy's! [Sandy sleeps in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door] Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... [falls out of the plane and screams]
Sandy: [surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?
Sandy: [turns upside down] Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. [a target is shown on the ground. SpongeBob and Sandy spin around]
SpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!
Sandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
SpongeBob: Okay! [gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate]
Sandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! [turns upside-down again]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger]
Sandy: Not a parakeet! Para- [Lands in a truck of clam manure, parachute inflates out of time] medic...
SpongeBob: [screams as he crashes through the target, breaking the ground and flips on the real-life ground] Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. [sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house] H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. [climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream. Shows a view of various girly decorations, other girly features and boyfriend portraits.] Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Pearl: Hello, SpongeBob! [sits at a table with a green rabbit toy and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup]
SpongeBob: [waves] Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Pearl: You're just in time for the tea party!
SpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Pearl: [Frowns] Oh. He's next door. [Rolls eyes, then shakes head in disappointment] Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
SpongeBob: Bye! [gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs on the right side of the screen] I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. [peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs’ boat]
Krabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon! [inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod] You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. [SpongeBob hops into the boat]
SpongeBob: Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Krabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. [Moby Dollar appears from the water, caught on the fishing hook] It's the mighty Moby Dollar! [Starts reeling in, making the Moby Dollar come closer and closer.] Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes! [Moby Dollar starts spitting out pennies] There she blows!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
Krabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
SpongeBob: [grabs a small jellyfishing net] This one?
Krabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
SpongeBob: [reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it] Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Krabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
SpongeBob: [opens up the wallet] Net ready, sir!
Krabs: [pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet] I did it! [gets excited] I finally did it!
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. [puts down the wallet to shake hands with Mr. Krabs, but the wallet starts bouncing away toward the back of the boat]
Krabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
SpongeBob: Huh?
Krabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! [SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat]
SpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!
Krabs: No! [dollar hops out of wallet and jumps like a dolphin away in the ocean]
SpongeBob: [grins nervously as Krabs glares at him] This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: [ties SpongeBob up with a rope tied to a plunger sticking out of a gun] You're fired! [Fires the gun, shooting the plunger and tossing SpongeBob with it]
SpongeBob: [screams as he gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building. The plunger is stuck onto a building.] Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: Zap! [zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out] I see you. [stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self] Zap! [shoots a green laser out of his eye]
Fred: My leg!
Plankton: I see you. Zap!
SpongeBob: Plankton! [tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle]
Plankton: I see you... [SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground] Zap! [zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on, then walks to the Krusty Krab. People continue to scream in panic] Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. [stomps on it] Crush! [picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it as if it were a lollipop and walks off] Lick, lick!
SpongeBob: This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary: Meow! Meow!
SpongeBob: [Stops and looks. Appears more and more worried.] Gary! Gary! No!
Gary: Meow! [Plankton still coming towards Gary making giant step sounds]
Plankton: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
SpongeBob: Gary! [jumps over to Gary and hugs him] I've got you, Gary!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! [steps on SpongeBob and Gary] Yeah! Huh? [lifts his foot from pain] Yow!
SpongeBob: [looking like a thumbtack] I think he's got the point. [laughs]
Plankton: [Starts shrinking.] Waaaaaah! [as he screams his voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal, puny size. Three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad] Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? [Burned Fred lifts his foot to step on him] No! No! No! Not the face! [gets squished. Wakes up screaming and his dream cloud pops, making dream SpongeBob fall to the ground]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping] Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. [goes to sleep] Ah... [wakes up after hearing his friends voices and faces hovering around his head]
Squidward: [his head starts circling SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [The heads of Mr Krabs, Sandy, Gary, Plankton, Pearl and Patrick start surrounding SpongeBob]
All: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tossing and turning in his sleep] What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! [Squidward taps him and he wakes up.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams, then sees his friends stand around his bed, except Patrick] Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
Squidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!
Sandy: Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!
All except Patrick: [grumble in agreement]
Plankton: Take a hike!
Squidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Gary: [In anger] Meow!
Patrick: [walks in] Does anyone have a quarter? [all stare at Patrick]


[At Glove World! Where SpongeBob and Patrick are standing outside the amusement park.]
SpongeBob: [Patrick is licking a glove-shaped lollipop] Another funtastic day at Glove World! [bus stops at the bus stop and both of them get in, but SpongeBob struggles for a bit with his balloon]
Bus Driver: Ahem. [points to coin deposit]
SpongeBob: Let me get my wallet. [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver's face] Wait, let me check this pocket. [turns around and the balloon hits him again] No... [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver again] Patrick? Do you have any change?
Patrick: How much do you need?
SpongeBob: How much is it?
Bus Driver: Fifty cents.
SpongeBob: [turns around and the balloon smacks the bus driver in the back of his head] Fifty cents.
Patrick: Nope.
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] Lemme check my other poc-
Bus Driver: Forget it!
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] What did you say?
Bus Driver: Just take your seat!
SpongeBob: Thanks, mister.
Bus Driver: Yeah, whatev- [SpongeBob turns around and balloon smacks him in the back of the head.]
Patrick: Show me what you got at Glove World!
SpongeBob: Okay! Here's my glove light. [turns on light]
Patrick: Wow...
SpongeBob: [puts light inside his head] I see you! [both laugh]
Patrick: I got gloves for my glove action-figure! [puts a tiny glove on the big glove's thumb]
SpongeBob: Cool! [Patrick looks out the window and notices a sign that says "You Are Now Leaving Bikini Bottom" as they drive past it]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [a tiny glove is on his nose] Yeah, Patrick?
Patrick: Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?
SpongeBob: Where did you see that?
Patrick: We just passed the sign. 'You are now in Leaving Bikini Bottom'.
SpongeBob: [gasps] What?! [looks out the window]
Patrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob? [driving past a sign that says "Bikini Bottom City Limits"]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think we're on the wrong... [Screams as bus drives down at a 90-degree angle road. SpongeBob and Patrick fly back and his the back of the bus] ...bus! [SpongeBob walks slowly up front. His face gets all distorted as he is moving closer. His pants rip off and fly at Patrick, but Patrick ducks in time. Then SpongeBob's underwear hits Patrick in the face. Bus comes to an immediate stop and both fly forward and hit the windshield. Then the balloon smacks the bus driver onto the windshield and all of them peel off. SpongeBob and Patrick are kicked off the bus] But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom.
Bus Driver: [hands balloon to SpongeBob] Oh, well. [drives bus away]
Patrick: What is this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [reads sign] Rock Bottom. [scroll over to a bus station] It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different. [picks up some green soil]
Green Soil: Do you... [raspberry] mind... [raspberry] putting me down? [SpongeBob shakes him off as he gasps]
Patrick: Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart! [bathroom doors have the "?" on one door and the "¿" on the other]
SpongeBob: Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know. [someone comes out the "¿" door. Patrick gasps] Maybe we should wait for one more. [a snake-like creature comes out of the "?" door. 3 creatures come out the "¿" door]
Patrick: I still can't read the sign! I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes. I'm gonna get a bus schedule. [walks off] Boy, this place sure is creepy. [bus drives by with Patrick's head sticking out the window]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here! [SpongeBob runs after the bus] SpongeBob...! [bus drives up the 90-degree angle road and SpongeBob tries to run up the road but falls down. Tries a couple more times but is unsuccessful]
SpongeBob: I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus. [puts on Grandpa disguise] Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle. [takes off disguise] I better go wait for the next one. [later, SpongeBob is standing by the bus stop sign with his glove balloon in his right hand] C'mon, bus! I've got to get home and feed Gary! [notices shoe untied and lets go of the balloon] Uh-oh, shoe's untied. [Puts foot on bus sign] Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over... [bus drives up and then drives off] and through the barrel. [later, wind is blowing SpongeBob's glove hat on his side so he puts it back. Wind blows balloon away] My balloon! [chases after balloon jumping for it when he gets the chance. A bus drives up and then drives off] Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus! Aww, not again! [throws hat down. Notices a creature with a red light on his head for an antenna] Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me? [the creature gives raspberry] Uhh, uhh, yeah, I... [creature runs after balloon] No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know when the next bus comes... [bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob runs after it, but decides to walk back to the bus stop sign] Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot no matter what! [SpongeBob's stomach growls] I'm gettin' hungry. Glove candy dispenser! Good thing I went to Glove World!. [squeezes out 6 tiny glove candies onto his tongue, then spits them out] Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that? [a Kandy Machine is shown across the road] A candy machine. [Rubs his tummy] Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. Mmm... [Checks each side of the road to see if a bus is coming] I'm not leaving this spot no matter what! [stomach growls] I'll only be gone a second. [runs over to the machine. While getting out a quarter, a bus drives up. Runs back across to bus] Hey! [bus drives off] Ooh! [stomach growls. Takes a few steps across the road and turns around to check for the bus. Takes a few more steps and checks again. Gets to the candy machine and takes out the quarter. Before inserting it, he checks for a bus. There's no bus so he puts in the quarter but a bus DOES come and drives off. Now he checks to his left down the road and decides to sprint across and get some candy. Pushes some buttons and checks for the bus. The candy is slowly coming down] Come on, come on! [candy drops to the bottom. SpongeBob grabs for it, but a bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob gets angry. He reaches for the candy but a bus comes up. Every time he reaches for the candy, the bus drives forward but when he pulls his arm away, the bus drives backwards. So he decides to leave the candy and run after the bus, but the bus drives off before he can get there. A creature comes up and takes the candy] Hey! That was mine! [walks over to the candy machine. 3 buses drives up and drive off while he's over there so he decides to run back. No more buses come, so he shakes the bus sign angrily] Barnacles! Alright, that's it! No more mister nice guy! [later, SpongeBob is at the candy machine staring at it and a bus drives up. Another SpongeBob tip-toes up, but the SpongeBob at the candy machine falls over revealing it to be made of wood. The bus drives off] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob is now a bench. A bus drives up, but drives off after it notices the SpongeBob bench] Fish paste! [walking into the bus station] I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom! I am first in line and no one is gonna tell me otherwise! [sees a giant green round creature standing behind him already in line] Okay, second! I am second in line! [sees another giant creature already in line] Okay, third is good! [another creature is already in line] Fourth, not bad. [Cut to SpongeBob at the end of the line behind a yellow creature] Okay, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it! [yellow creature spits out a giant egg on SpongeBob's head with the number 329 on it]
Window Attendant: Next. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Well, at least the line is moving. [everyone steps forward. Egg hatches 3 baby yellow creatures that jump in front of SpongeBob, thus making him now 331st in line. SpongeBob gets extremely angry. He lets out an angry growl.] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob hides inside his clothes and goes ballistic. Then comes out and everyone staring at him turns around]
Window Attendant: [time is going fast. raspberry] Next. [raspberry] Next. [raspberry. SpongeBob is sleeping] Next. [raspberry] Next.
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh?
Window Attendant: Next. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Finally! Yes, I'm next! [runs up to the window] When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?
Window Attendant: What? [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The bus schedule. The next bus.
Window Attendant: I can't... [raspberry] understand... [raspberry] your accent. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The next bus... [raspberry] to Bikini... [raspberry] Bottom. [long raspberry]
Window Attendant: Ohh. [raspberry] Why didn't you say so? [raspberry] Next bus leaves in... [raspberry] 5 seconds. [bus leaves] Ohh, tough luck, kid. [raspberry] That's the last one til' morning. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Oh, [raspberry] no... [raspberry] you don't! [raspberry]
Window Attendant: Goodnight! [puts closed sign up]
SpongeBob: Hold it, I'm not through here! [raspberry] Do you hear me? [raspberry] I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom right now! Until then, I am not leaving this spot! [gives 3 raspberries. Lights turn off. SpongeBob laughs nervously] Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light! [turns on light] Ah, that's better.
[The glove light stops working; short pause.]
SpongeBob: This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... advanced darkness. Hey! [closes eyes] If I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark.
[A raspberry is heard in the distance; he opens his eyes]
SpongeBob: Who's there?! [walks down the road] Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking. [hears another raspberry] Running! Better start running! Running! [hears another raspberry] Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting! [runs into the 90-degree angle road. Sits down with scallops flying around his head] Sitting, sitting. Bleeding. [hears noise] Hey, who's there? [hears another raspberry] Okay, that's enough! [hears another raspberry] Don't come closer! [hears another raspberry] I'm warning you! [hears another raspberry] I'm a sponge! [a red light shines around SpongeBob. It's the friendly creature from before that chased after the balloon] Oh, it's only you. [the creature ties balloon to SpongeBob's wrist] Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem. [the creature begins blowing balloon bigger] I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon... [raspberry] has... [raspberry] enough... [raspberry] air... [raspberry] thanks. [gives a few more raspberries as he is floating up] Hey, I get it, balloon travel! Thank... [raspberry] you! [raspberry]
Creature: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob, with the balloon still tied to his wrist, floats all the way back home] Ah, home at last. [balloon pops]
Patrick: [riding another bus to Rock Bottom] Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya!


SpongeBob: Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahhh, what a beautiful day! [SpongeBob's hand appears from a sand castle pineapple with his face drawn on his hand] I wonder if Patrick's at home.
Patrick: Hiya, SpongeBob! [Patrick's hand comes over from a sand castle rock with his face drawn on his hand] Whatcha doin'?
SpongeBob: Goin' over to Sandy's place. [both hands walk off together and arrive at a sand-made treedome] Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
Sandy: Don't lose your barnacles, boys. Hi-yah! [Chops sand castle peak down making a sand image of Texas] There it is!
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: Can't you see? It's Texas.
SpongeBob: Texas? What's a Texas? [a wave covers sand and ruins Sandy's Texas display]
Sandy: Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.
SpongeBob: All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.
Sandy: You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Sandy? Hi-yah!
Sandy: Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.
SpongeBob: Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy. [Turns around] Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah! [grabs Don the Whale from behind and flips him over onto the ground. Don growls like a dog and punches SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy? [surfs in the air] Surf's up, Sandy!
Sandy: No, thanks. [enters Jellyfish Fields. Jellyfish are heard buzzing]
SpongeBob: [Runs after a jellyfish with a net] Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing! [Patrick runs after one while laughing, then falls on his face. He gets up and runs again]
SpongeBob: Look, Sandy, we caught one!
Sandy: Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
Patrick: Fly away, little critter!
SpongeBob: Go on, go back to where you belong. [the jellyfish flies away as Sandy watches tearfully] Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home! [Sandy begins to cry, filling her helmet with tears. She takes out a flusher handle and attaches it to her helmet. She pulls it down and all her tears drain out. Sandy gasps for air and pants.]
SpongeBob: Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?
Sandy: I ain't crying! My helmet just sprung a leak!
SpongeBob: [suspicious] Sandy...
Sandy: [confessing] Oh, I guess I'm just feeling a little homesick.
SpongeBob: Homesick, huh? [SpongeBob thinks, and later, Sandy is blindfolded as SpongeBob and Patrick take her somewhere] Almost there.
Sandy: Heck gum it, SpongeBob, what is it?
SpongeBob: Da-ta-dah. [the three are standing outside the Treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Welcome home, Sandy!
[pause. Sandy cries and runs into the treedome.]
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: Go away. [pulls a lever which brings down a metal covering on the treedome]
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?
Patrick: Maybe it's just a squirrel thing. [a hole opens up in the top of the dome and Sandy comes out wearing a cowgirl hat and holding a guitar. Sandy tunes it]
Sandy: ♪Wish I was back in Texas. The ocean's no place for a squirrel.♪ [live action Texas scenery appears behind her] ♪Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world oh no. I guess that deep in my heart, I'll always be a Texas girl. I wanna go hooooooooooooooome, home.♪ [some clams howl along. SpongeBob and Patrick hear the music]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, do you hear that? [Patrick has the notes going around him]
Patrick: Arrrgh! Get them off me! Get them off me!
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy.
Sandy: ♪I wanna wake up in Texas.♪ [live action scenery is shown] ♪I miss those wide open skies. I miss my twenty acres, barbecues and pecan pies, oh, why? When I'm so far from you Texas, all I can do is cry.♪ [a live-action squirrel sheds a tear. SpongeBob and Patrick start sobbing. At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs hears the song, too, and starts sobbing also and accidentally gets hit by the cash register.]
Fish #1, #2, #3: Please Make It Stop! [Two customers are also sobbing; one dries his eyes with his Krabby Patty and gives it to the next person who blows his nose on it]
Sandy: ♪I wanna go hoooommme.♪ [Junior Brown's voice] ♪I wanna go home.♪ [as she sings she goes back into the Treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick continue sobbing and then stop]
Patrick: Do you think she knows the Muffin Man song?
SpongeBob: Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas.
Patrick: Well, let's go get some Texas and bring it down here!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing!
Patrick: [mishears, and frantically covers himself] Where?
[Later, SpongeBob and Patrick have gotten everything ready at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now.
Mr. Krabs: [from inside] Well, hurry up, lads! We can't squat like this forever!
[at Sandy's house where SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are playing leapfrog while going to her treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Sandy's surprise is at the Krusty Krab!
Patrick: Wait until she sees the...
SpongeBob: Shh! Don't spoil the surprise! [SpongeBob knocks, Sandy opens her door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, Sandy!
SpongeBob: You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [walks out with two suitcases] Hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob: What are you doing with those bags?
Sandy: I'm going back home to Texas.
SpongeBob: What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we...
Sandy: It's time for this tumbleweed to tumble on home.
SpongeBob: Wait, Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: I'm tired of fish food, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, don't you want to say goodbye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [gets on a bus] I just can't do that, SpongeBob. It'd be too sad.
SpongeBob: No, no! Wait! Sandy! [the bus drives off] I can't believe she's gone.
Patrick: Yeah. What's so great about dumb ol' Texas? [the bus suddenly speeds back; the doors open revealing a very angry Sandy]
Sandy: What did you say?
Patrick: Texas is dumb?
Sandy: [the bus drives off again] Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain!
SpongeBob: You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?
Sandy: No, you can't!
Patrick: Then can we say people from Texas are dumb?
Sandy: No! You can't say nothing about Texas!
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about... [turns around; grabs his behind and shakes it and rolls eyes] Texas!
Sandy: [blushes angrily] I'm warnin' you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all!
Patrick: I'm Texas, too! Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
SpongeBob: Howdy y'all!
Patrick: Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
Sandy: Y'all best cut it out!
SpongeBob: [while Patrick does armpit farts] The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas! [Sandy gets steaming mad. SpongeBob turns into the shape of Texas] Hey, Patrick, what am I now?
Patrick: Uhh, stupid?
SpongeBob: No, I'm Texas!
Patrick: What's the difference?! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Sandy: [drops suitcases] Y'all best apologize, or I'm gonna be on you like ugly on an ape!
SpongeBob: You'll have to catch us first! [SpongeBob and Patrick run off] We did it! We got her!
Patrick: Krusty Krab, here we come! [turns head around to Sandy] Can we say that plants from Texas are dumb? Can we say that shoes from Texas are dumb?
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, that's enough.
Patrick: Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna... [...catch up, which she is. And fast. Patrick's eyes bug out and he screams]
SpongeBob: Run faster, Patrick! [both of them scream; they go around each side of a huge rock. Sandy crashes right through the rock, obliterating it, and walks with a twirling rope. Her shoe engulfs the screen, Sandy ropes Patrick and brings him into the background]
Patrick: [screams] SpongeBob! [Nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears. SpongeBob screams. SpongeBob stops in front of a leaf and shakes as Sandy karate chops the leaf and SpongeBob in half]
Sandy: Hi-yah! [SpongeBob jumps with his halves and he gets back together] Y'all gonna take back what ya said!
SpongeBob: No! Almost there! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. Sandy's rope turns into the shape of SpongeBob; SpongeBob screams. As he jumps for the Krusty Krab, Sandy throws her rope. SpongeBob hangs onto the door as Sandy pulls him towards her]
Sandy: SpongeBob, you've been messing with the bull! Now here come the horns!
SpongeBob: Sandy, no! [the front of the Krusty Krab tears off as Sandy has pulled tight enough]
Everyone: Howdy, y'all!
Sandy: Wha-what's this?
SpongeBob: It's a party!
Patrick: [hops over with arms and legs tied and covered in bandages] For you!
Sandy: For me?!
SpongeBob: It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out, Sandy! We got square dancing... [Flats is holding a square] ...giant Barbecues... [Squidward is holding a sharp, spiky Q]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: ...homemade peas-in-a-can pie... [Pearl is holding a pie with a can of peas in it] ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats! [SpongeBob and Patrick put ten gallon water jugs on their heads] So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?
[Sandy starts to laugh and tears of laughter spew out and fill her helmet. Everyone frowns as tears start to well up in SpongeBob and Patrick's eyes']
SpongeBob: Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags.
Sandy: [takes out the flusher handle, attaches it to her helmet and flushes the water out again] I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya. [Everyone gathers around Sandy]
Sandy: Huh? Duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.
SpongeBob: Does that mean you'll stay?
Sandy: I'm staying! [Everyone cheers, except Squidward]
SpongeBob: That makes me feel all wiggly.
Patrick: Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas? [cheering stops; cut back to the Bikini Atoll]
Sandy: What did you just say?!
Patrick: Should I start running now?


[metallic roaring]
Plankton: [enters Goo Lagoon and he uses his bulldozer to remove the sign. He leaves his bulldozer] Attention, beach-goers! You are trespassing! You have exactly 17 minutes to haul your carcasses off the future site of the [puts up a sign] 'Chum Bucket Mega Bucket.' [he makes a loud squeaking noise that catches some of the beachgoers' attention]
Tina: Do you hear something? [Peterson doesn't hear anything, and he shakes his head "no." The Lifeguard thinks the sound is coming from his megaphone, looks inside it and then turns it upside-down and shakes it.]
Plankton: [takes out megaphone] Okay, have it your way. I don't mind bulldozing over each and every one--
Billy: [grabs Plankton's bulldozer] Mommy, look! Somebody left this toy tractor here.
Evelyn: Put that down, Billy, that has germs on it.
Billy: [drops the bulldozer] Aw, mom.
Plankton: [talks through megaphone] You'll see. [throws away the megaphone] You'll all see! The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretinous beachgoers. But it's becoming increasingly obvious... I can deny it no longer... [zoom out] I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need... [giant foot almost steps on Plankton but he dives out of the way] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Plankton: Yes. He's the one. [laughs evilly. The sand on his head falls off]
SpongeBob: I'll have one... [some kid cuts in front of him]
Monroe: Two, please. [Lou gives him two ice creams] Thanks. [walks off]
SpongeBob: One, please. [Electric Eel slithers through SpongeBob and grabs the ice cream]
Eel: 'Scuse me. [walks off licking the ice cream]
SpongeBob: One, please.
Lou: Sorry, kid. We're all out.
SpongeBob: Aww, barnacles. [he hears crying coming from Plankton, who's sitting on a bench with two ice creams] Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?
Plankton: Oh, hi, SpongeBob. [blows his nose] I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one! [cries] I don't know what to do with the other one! [SpongeBob is confused; Plankton cries then stops for a second and looks at SpongeBob and cries again.]
SpongeBob: I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.
Plankton: SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?
SpongeBob: Sure! [starts to lick the ice cream]
Plankton: SpongeBob... [SpongeBob is still licking the ice cream] SpongeBob? [SpongeBob eats the whole ice cream and is now licking what's left inside. Plankton uses his megaphone to get SpongeBob's attention] SPONGEBOB!!!
SpongeBob: [turns towards Plankton] Yeah? [spits out ice cream as he talks]
Plankton: Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance. [SpongeBob licks his fingers] You can have anything you want with a little training. [SpongeBob licks his fingers again]
SpongeBob: Training?
Plankton: Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.
SpongeBob: Assertive, huh?
Plankton: That's right.
SpongeBob: Anything I want. [licks his lips] Sounds great! [spits more ice cream at Plankton when talking]
Plankton: Wonderful. [laughs evilly then SpongeBob joins in the laughing. Then an adult fish sits on SpongeBob] SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!
SpongeBob: Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face.
Plankton: No, no, be assertive! [SpongeBob puts his fingers in the guy's pockets]
SpongeBob: ...beep, beep! [Plankton facepalms]
Plankton: NOT INSERTIVE! [adult fish checks his watch, then walks away] SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!
SpongeBob: But I'm a spo...
Plankton: Don't say it! [Plankton spots the eel that took SpongeBob's ice cream] There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?
SpongeBob: Ice cream! [Plankton gets up and runs behind Electric Eel]
Plankton: Listen, you! My friend's got something to say! [Electric Eel turns around]
Eel: What, who said that? [talks to SpongeBob] Was it you?
Plankton: Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!
SpongeBob: That's my ice cream cone!
Plankton: Great! Now let him have it!
SpongeBob: [misunderstanding what Plankton means] You can have it.
Eel: Say, thanks! [walks off]
Plankton: No! [jumps inside SpongeBob's mouth] I'll show ya how! [voicing for SpongeBob, SpongeBob stands still.] Hey, pencil neck! [Electric Eel turns around] Yeah, you... slither over here! [Electric Eel walks over to SpongeBob] Surrender that ice cream cone, or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery! [Electric Eel looks scared; he throws the ice cream onto SpongeBob's face and runs away crying]
SpongeBob: Hey, that guy was crying!
Plankton: Those were tears of joy! He was happy that you were assertive!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Plankton: You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.
Plankton: Whatever.
SpongeBob: Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it! [throws ice cream on  his tongue, hitting Plankton who is still on it. Later, he is using a metal detector, and it beeps] I found something!
Scooter Like Fish: Uhh, excuse me, my metal detector broke. Can I use yours? [SpongeBob hands the equipment to him]
SpongeBob: Sure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!
SpongeBob: [misunderstands] Hey, do you want to take a hike with me?
Scooter Like Fish: Yeah!
Plankton: [angry] ...NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!
SpongeBob: [sees a ditch] Hey! Go check in that ditch! [points to the ditch beside them. The fish jumps down in the ditch and finds a treasure chest]
Scooter Like Fish: Wow! Buried treasure! Thanks!
SpongeBob: Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!
SpongeBob: Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!
Fish: But I'm wearing sandals!
SpongeBob: Okay, never mind! [Plankton jumps off of SpongeBob] It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?
Plankton: [putting things into a suitcase] Oh, nothing, SpongeBob. [puts on a black hat] I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.
SpongeBob: No it's not!
Plankton: Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.
SpongeBob: But what about airline food?
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night! [rimshot] See, I can be a stand-up guy. See? [Plankton throws his hat down]
Plankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!
Plankton: Okay, but this is your last chance! [points to people trying to get a tan] Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?
SpongeBob: Just watch me! [runs over and waves a blanket up and down and builds up sand to make the beach-goers run away] Man, this thing is sandy!
Fred: My leg! [after everyone runs off, SpongeBob is laying on his back with a funnel acting as a sunlamp]
Plankton: Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach! [SpongeBob now has a tan and looks brown] SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?
SpongeBob: Well, not all of me.
Hot Dog Man: Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
Plankton: Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!
SpongeBob: I'll do better than that! [he stretches his tongue to eat everybody's hotdogs]
Plankton: SpongeBob, that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!
SpongeBob: What?
Plankton: Breaking your wind! [SpongeBob uses one of his teeth to boomerang it into cutting the strings off the kites]
Larry: Hey, SpongeBob, throw us the ball! [SpongeBob pops the volleyball and trumpets like an elephant. Everybody leaves the beach]
SpongeBob: Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male! [sees Plankton missing] Plankton? [Plankton is driving a crane] Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!
Plankton: Exactly.
SpongeBob: You didn't tell me everyone would leave.
Plankton: Oops. [he presses a button in his crane, and the "Mega Bucket" sign comes out from the ground]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mega Bucket?! You used me... FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT! [voice cracks] That wasn't nice!
Plankton: Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: Well, what about aggressively nice people?
Plankton: Huh? What are you doing?! [SpongeBob brings out the hot dogs he ate earlier and puts them back where they belong. Then he puts the kites back where they were] Wait, SpongeBob! Stop! [a girl is crying because she has sand on her ice cream. SpongeBob takes it and wipes the sand off with his eyelashes] Butterfly kisses... can't take it... it's too cute... it's disgusting! [Scooter is crying at his broken surfboard]
SpongeBob: What happened? [points to surfboard]
Scooter: I hit a reef with my new board, dude!
SpongeBob: No problem! [makes himself a surfboard]
Scooter: Whoa! [grabs the surfboard] Killer!
Plankton: SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back! [everyone comes back] Wait! [everyone steps on Plankton. He is squished. Scooter is surfing]
Scooter: Cowabunga! Thanks, dude! That was awesome!
SpongeBob: Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket.
Plankton: Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting. [bunches up into a ball] NEED... HATRED... [crawls away]
SpongeBob: Volleyball, anyone? [everyone uses SpongeBob as the ball] Serve up! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch!


[the episode begins with Gary snoring and meowing]
SpongeBob: Wake up, Gary.
Gary: [wakes up] Meow?
SpongeBob: We're moving today!
Gary: [quizzically] Meow?
SpongeBob: That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants! [puts on a hat and fake beard]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [He takes away Gary's bowl] No more food. [gives Gary a plate with clams on it] Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells. [SpongeBob puts salt in the shells, and Gary starts crying] April Fools! [takes off the outfit and puts Gary's food bowl back onto the floor] There ya go, pal!
Gary: Meow. [eats]
SpongeBob: [goes into the kitchen] Whew, I'm thirsty! [takes a big glass of lemonade out of the fridge] [male voice] This is an extreme thirst! [sets the lemonade down on the floor; bubble transition to him putting all the lemonade into a lot of small glasses with umbrellas]
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!! [holds up a mirror] ...To me! [laughs obnoxiously and walks outside and towards work. Squidward sees him]
Squidward: What's he so happy about? [walks by the calendar and notices it's April Fools Day. He panics] April 1st? [screams] April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday! [puts a heating pad on his head and dials the number for the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today, I caught something terrible.
Mr. Krabs: [over phone] What'd ya catch?
Squidward: I caught sight of the calendar.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.
[Squidward runs to the Krusty Krab with an artist uniform on]
Squidward: I have arrived. [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh] What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh more]
Mr. Krabs: You just missed him.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but he told us to tell you...
Squidward: Tell me what?
SpongeBob: [whispers into Squidward's ear] He told me to tell you... April Fools.
Squidward: [lays his hat on the table] Well, it's been nice working here. [he walks off] Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait!
Squidward: Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward! [grabs Squidward's legs] It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!
Squidward: You do?
SpongeBob: Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?
[Mr. Krabs sits on a whoopee cushion and it "farts." SpongeBob laughs]
Squidward: Well, as long as it's not me.
[bubble transition to SpongeBob carrying a tray of burger patties when an old lady comes by]
Miss Shell: Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?
SpongeBob: They're riiiight here, lady! [leads her to the utensils]
Miss Shell: [picks up a spoon] But, this is a spoon...
SpongeBob: APRIL FOOLS! [laughs; Squidward stares at SpongeBob and he runs away; bubble transition to SpongeBob behind the register; a customer comes up to him] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?
Nat: [raises up his left arm] Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [points at something] Hey, what's that?
[Nat turns around; SpongeBob turns around and has a smiley face on his back]
Nat: Well, I didn't see anything... [notices that SpongeBob is gone] hey, where'd that other guy go?
[SpongeBob turns around]
SpongeBob: April Fools!! I'm right here!!
Nat: [laughs] Hey, that was pretty good.
[SpongeBob laughs obnoxiously; Squidward notices SpongeBob behind the register]
Squidward: What are you doing behind the counter?
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob wiping the floor; Tom comes by with a cup of soda]
Tom: Excuse me, can I get a couple of ice cubes in here, please?
SpongeBob: Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up! [fills the cup with ice and comes back whistling] Here you go.
Tom: Thanks. [he takes a sip of his drink; SpongeBob titters and Tom looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before Tom turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom takes another sip of his drink; SpongeBob starts giggling again and then Tom turns around and looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before he turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom finishes his drink] Ah.
SpongeBob: [laughs loudly and obnoxiously] April Fools! [Tom grabs SpongeBob by the collar, suddenly panicked]
Tom: WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY DRINK?!
SpongeBob: I... [giggles] I... [giggles]
Tom: YOU WHAT?!?!
SpongeBob: You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one! [laughs]
Tom: I guess that is pretty funny! [laughs as he walks off]
SpongeBob: [laughs so hard his tongue pops off] Hey, your shoes untied. [tongue looks down] April Fools! You're not wearing shoes! [laughs and hugs his tongue, which smiles. Then they laugh into the microphone; everyone hears it; in the kitchen, Squidward tries to mute the sound with tissues, but he can still hear it] APRIL FOOOOOLS! [Squidward drops a plate]
Squidward: That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about! [bubble transition to him squirting some mustard inside a rope circle then he chuckles and shows SpongeBob the mess]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up! [starts cleaning it and Squidward is standing next to a rope which he is about to cut]
Squidward: APRIL FOOLS! [laughs as he cuts the rope which grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Whooaahh! [the rope sends him into a bag of flour. Squidward is laughing through all of this and rolls on the floor. Then SpongeBob is taken around a bar] Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl... [screams as he is sent slamming face-first into the wall]
Customers: Oh, no!
[Squidwards eyes pop out as he laughs hysterically. SpongeBob screams and flies into Bubble Bass' rear]
SpongeBob: Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [Cut to Squidward cheerleading, laughing, and jumping into the air. Then SpongeBob smashes into the ceiling]
Squidward: [runs and holds out his arms to catch SpongeBob] I'll catch you, SpongeBob! [he giggles to himself. SpongeBob screams as he plummets toward Squidward, who quickly sets out a garbage can in front of him, and SpongeBob falls into the goop in the can] Oops. [dumps SpongeBob, who is now the shape of the can, out of the garbage can] April Fools, you little sausage! [he laughs]
SpongeBob: ...Ohhh!&#160;:( [SpongeBob sobs hysterically and runs out of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You all know I was just kidding… Right?
Wobbles: Aww, man, poor kid.
Shubie: That guy has definitely got some issues to work out. [The customers angrily glare at Squidward as they begin to leave]
Olive green fish: April Fools... jerk. [All the customers storm out the door in disgust] 
Squidward: Wait, don't go!
Man: Hey, you stink!
Squidward: Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh... [looks around at the mess he has made and winces, then he looks at Bubble Bass, who has a hole in his bottom due to the "prank" and Squidward starts to feel ashamed of himself] Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach. [makes silly face] Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo- [throat goes haywire] gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought. [bubble transition to Squidward going to SpongeBob's pineapple; he knocks on SpongeBob's door] SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob? [notices a Krusty Krab hat and goes over there to talk to the man who is wearing it] Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do, so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am... What? [notices that the guy with the hat on is Patrick] Patrick? What are you doing here?
Patrick: Digging.
Squidward: Why are you wearing that hat?
Patrick: Hmm, I don't know. [takes off the hat]
Squidward: [growls] Where's SpongeBob?
Patrick: He's in the house. He's impressed.
Squidward: With what?
Patrick: I don't know, but it must've been pretty good to make him cry like that.
Squidward: [shivers then goes back to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there! [tries to turn the handle, but SpongeBob's arm comes from under the door and pulls it inside; Squidward grabs his clarinet] SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this! [plays clarinet horribly. SpongeBob opens the door]
SpongeBob: What do you want?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. [sticks out tongue while talking]
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: I'm trying to say I'm [turns into a donkey and starts braying] hee-haw-hee-haw!
SpongeBob: What?!
Squidward: I'm just trying to say that I'm... [head explodes] There's gotta be an easier way to do this. [bubble transition to Squidward writing a note; he puts it in a bottle and rolls it to SpongeBob where he picks it up] Well, aren't you going to open it?
SpongeBob: I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.
Squidward: Doh! [Squidward hands SpongeBob a can and Squidward drives to the other side of the road] SpongeBob, I'm... [whispers into the can, then puts the can up to his ear but hears some sort of noise; Patrick is flossing his teeth with the cord; Squidward growls and throws the binoculars down on the ground] SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am... [waves tentacles in the air and bubbles form, puts a big bubble on his head and then talks] ...sorry. [pops the bubble] There you go.
SpongeBob: But I couldn't... [Squidward slams the door in his face]
Squidward: I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear! [Starts to walk away, when an image of Patrick appears in the air]
Patrick: It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that. [Squidward nervously continues walking and runs into a ghost image of a guy at the Krusty Krab]
Tom: April Fools, jerk. [Squidward frantically starts running again, but this time his mother appears]
Mrs. Tentacles: [male voice] YOU STINK!
Squidward: Mother? [runs back to SpongeBob's house to apologize] All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and... [SpongeBob opens the door slightly]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Is all that true?
Squidward: Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.
SpongeBob: Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
Squidward: What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.
SpongeBob: I promise.
Squidward: Really? [SpongeBob opens the door all the way, revealing the citizens of Bikini Bottom inside]
Everyone: April Fools!
Squidward: [twitches eye] April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all! [laughs hysterically while going back into his house]
SpongeBob: What would we do without Squidward?


Narrator: Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends. [shows fishermen in boats fishing near the Bikini Bottom atoll]
Squidward: SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
SpongeBob: Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table 9. [uses himself as a cleaning tool]
Mr. Krabs: They're back! They're back, I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes! [everyone looks at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] The hooks! The hooks!
Fred: How about a mint?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! The hooks!
Tom: Can you make that to go?
Squidward: [gives Tom his food in a bag] You don't know how lucky you are.
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! So there I was, minding my own business...
Squidward: I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, uhmmm... I have to do my waste basket inspection. [puts a trashcan on his head] Uh-huh, mmhmm, oh, yeah, there's one.
Mr. Krabs: Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya!
SpongeBob: Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks, me bucko! They're back. Beware the hooks!
SpongeBob: The hooks?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. [shapes his arm like a hook as SpongeBob looks at his arm] The hooks. [The camera shows SpongeBob's face with a reflection with Mr. Krabs' arm as a hook] They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches... [grabs Scooter's pants and lifts high like he is giving him a wedgie. His drink decreases every time Mr. Krabs grabs his pants as he sips it] ...and haul you way up high! Then higher, AND HIGHER, AND HIGHER [he opens a hatch on the roof and points at the surface] until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath! And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya... or worse!
SpongeBob: [gasps] What could be worse than that?!
Mr. Krabs: Gift shops. [shows gift shop and the inside of the gift shop]
SpongeBob: [gasps and hides under a box] Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen! Time is money!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs! [goes in the kitchen with the box on him]
Patrick: [pokes his head through one of the kitchen windows] Gooooood morning, Krusty Crew.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go!
SpongeBob: I can't leave now. I'm working.
Patrick: It's not leaving. You're just taking a break. [SpongeBob goes outside behind unseen] We're going to the carnival, we're going to the carni... [trips and falls on face] We're going to the carnival, we're going to the carnival! There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town! [many hooks are dangling] I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
SpongeBob: Where is everybody?
Patrick: I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier. [a pair of kids' sneakers lie on the ground nearby]
SpongeBob: Doesn't look like any carnival I ever... [bumps into a hook] Excuse me. [gasps as he sees the hook as the camera shows SpongeBob's face again with the reflection with a hook] Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks! Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!
Patrick: [sits on a hook] Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese.
SpongeBob: All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!
[Patrick is putting the cheese in his mouth]
Patrick: Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it! [the hook where Patrick ate the cheese from is pulled up]
SpongeBob: [faces another hook with cheese attached to it] But, Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: SpongeBob, let me ask you something. [the hook that SpongeBob is facing is pulled up. Patrick is shown with 9 hooks in his mouth and still has 1 in his hand] Does this look dangerous?
SpongeBob: [screams] Patrick, don't!
Patrick: Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... [hooks pulls him up]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back! Oh, my best friend! [Patrick floats down and SpongeBob runs into him as he hits the ground] Patrick, you're alive!
Patrick: Am I ever! You should try it.
SpongeBob: But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?
Patrick: You just jump off before you go up too high.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
Patrick: Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? [he jumps on a fish-like attachment on the hook]
SpongeBob: Well, no.
Patrick: Wheeee!
SpongeBob: I guess he didn't! [he jumps on the attachment with Patrick]
Patrick: Hi-yo, Silverfish! AWAYYYYYY!!!! [The hook pulls them up. We see a fisherman reeling in his fishing rod. We see SpongeBob and Patrick laughing out of enjoyment. The camera alternates between the fisherman and his partner to SpongeBob and Patrick. After a few cuts, SpongeBob and Patrick are about to jump off]
SpongeBob: Ready?
Patrick: Ready!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Geronimo!! [jump off]
SpongeBob: This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab! [On the surface, the fishermen are having a smoke break, disappointed at having lost their catch. Cut to the exterior at the Krusty Krab when customers are muttering angrily. We cut to see Ivy mad with Harold]
Ivy: P.U.! [points at his Krabby Patty] You call this food?!
Harold: My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!
Another Harold: [Starts holding up his fried boot] My sandwich is a fried boot!
Fred: Hurry it up, will ya?! We're hungry over here! Look at us! My kids haven't eaten and I'm dying! [customers muttering angrily... all talking at once; Squidward frantically flipping burnt patties] That's not how you're supposed to flip it!
Fish: Can you see, we're hungry! That's wrong!
Female Fish: I want a nice good meal!
Squidward: [defensive] WHY DO YOU WANNA EAT THIS STUFF ANYWAY?!?
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
Squidward: It's a feeding frenzy, sir! And SpongeBob's not back from his break. [Mr. Krabs laughs] What?
Mr. Krabs: I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taken a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59. [laughs] Now, what were you saying?
Squidward: He took a break.
Mr. Krabs: [stares in shocked silence, as his arms and nose fall off. He then storms out the front door] Alright, SpongeBob LAZY Pants! I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues. [uses his nose to smell] Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget!
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I still need help! [all the customers pick up Squidward like they are a mob]
Mr. Krabs: [uses his nose to smell again] They should be right here. [SpongeBob and Patrick float down as they are laughing]
Patrick: Again?
SpongeBob: Again!
Mr. Krabs: The hooks!! No! No! No!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [pulling on hook] 1, 2, 3!
Mr. Krabs&#160;: Wait! WAIT...!!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Blastoff!! [hook pulls them up as Mr. Krabs slams into a rock]
Mr. Krabs: Boys! I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [sobs] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd... [SpongeBob and Patrick float back down while laughing] ...I'D THROTTLE 'EM! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
SpongeBob: I...I...I...
Patrick: I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride 'em up, and up, and up. Then you gently flow down!
Mr. Krabs: And do you know what happens when you don't float back down!?!
SpongeBob: Gift shop?
Mr. Krabs: Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna! [shows a can of tuna] With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise! [shows a jar of mayo while a female screams in the background]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [raises hands] We promise, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I need a sailor's promise! Repeat after me: yo-ho! Yo-ho! Near the hooks I'll never go!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yo-ho. Yo-ho. Near the hooks we'll never go.
[a hook pokes Mr. Krabs in the butt]
Mr. Krabs: [leaps up, holding his injured rear] YOW! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahh! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck! [they turn and rub their own behinds]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa, whew! Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. [Cuts to the exterior of SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'M READY! [comes running out of the house] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready, I'm ready... [Patrick comes out from his rock]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way! [crashes into his furniture]
SpongeBob: I always go to work this way.
Patrick: You're not going to work today. We're going to go play "Hooky"!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we promised.
Patrick: Well, I had my fingers crossed.
SpongeBob: You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us!
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
SpongeBob: Umm...
Patrick: See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun. [Patrick goes up and down the hooks] Come on, SpongeBob! You know you want to!
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another... [almost runs into a hook. Gasps] ...hook! [almost touches the hook but takes it back] Oh no. Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar. A deceiver. I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never! [goes back to hook] Is this seat taken? [hook takes him up, but when he comes down and turns around, it is shown that he is hooked at the pants] Whew! Glad I got that out of my system. [gasps] I'm hooked. And that means... [shows the tuna can with SpongeBob crammed inside] AAAAAHHH!!! HELP!! I'M HOOKED! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Pearl: Thanks, dad.
Mr. Krabs: Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
Mr. Krabs: Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
SpongeBob: Umm...no. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! Yes, you told me not to go near them!
Mr. Krabs: Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Of course not. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean, not exactly. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! YES I DID IT! I admit it! [cries] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me. [shows the hook to Mr. Krabs] I'm hooked!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy. [group of girls laugh. SpongeBob looks at his pants]
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls! [hook pulls him closer] D’oh, okay! I'm taking 'em off. I'm taking 'em off. [takes pants off] There.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... lad?
SpongeBob: [screams, after noticing the hook caught in his underwear] Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs! I can't do it. Anything but that!
Mr. Krabs: I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob. [he places a "Help Wanted" sign on the door] But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [hook pulls him a little closer] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise! [He holds on to a flower but the hook pulls him away. He holds on to the Krusty Krab signpost] Please save me, Mr. Krabs! [cries] I promise I'll be good! [underwear tears off] Whew! [the signpost flings him into the door naked, which makes the girls laugh]
Pearl: Oooh, look! It's SpongeBob NUDIE Pants! [SpongeBob screams and runs]
Squidward: [holding a fishing rod with SpongeBob's underwear on the hook] Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Squidward: Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. [both laugh. Shows SpongeBob running back to his house]
SpongeBob: The pants! The underwear! [cries]
Patrick: [bus drops off a can of tuna] Hellllo? Does somebody have a can opener?


[The exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple is shown. The scene zooms into the interior of the pineapple, SpongeBob's bed room. His alarm clock goes off. SpongeBob gets up, still in his underwear, puts his blanket on like a cape, and uses the wind of the alarm clock to "fly" at his big calendar. He lands on the 20th day, which is a Sunday.] 
SpongeBob: Wow, it's Sunday, Gary! Guess what's for breakfast?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [The scene changes to show the two his kitchen. SpongeBob opens the door.] That's right! [puts a bowl on the kitchen counter] A sundae! [runs to the freezer and finds it empty] Whoops... Looks like we're out of ice cream. Guess I'll have to use something else... Ketchup! [Runs back to the bowl with a big bottle of Ketchup. He squeezes a bunch of ketchup into the bowl. He runs over to a cupboard] Hmmm... Bananas... Cherries... Boring. [closes cupboard door] Ah, here we go! Onions! [runs up to the counter with two sacks that say "onions" on them.] Ready, Gary?
Gary: Meow. [Plays a violin while SpongeBob cries while peeling the onions into the bowl]
SpongeBob: Just one more thing! Pea... [opens up another cupboard, but finds an empty jar] ...nuts. Gary! [He walks over to Gary while shaking the empty jar] Our peanuts jar is totally empty! [Gary burps] Hmmm... [snaps fingers] Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts. [looks in the bathroom and finds a peanut plant in front of the window] Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill. [throws the plant into the sundae bowl] A little texture never hurt. There we go. [gets out a spoon] This sundae's gonna taste great! [He turns around] Aren't you going to help me, Gary? Gary? Oh, well. More for me! [takes a few spoonfuls. Scene cuts to SpongeBob coming out of the kitchen with a bunch of stink coming out with him. He drops his spoon while Gary hides behind a coral plant.] You know what they say, Gary. I'm easy like Sunday morning. ["morning" comes out of SpongeBob's mouth and wraps itself around Gary's eyes, twisting them. The scene changes to show SpongeBob outside his house.] Okay, let's see my to-do list. [takes out a big long list] Go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work.. [his list "droops"] Wait, that's not right. I need the one for Sunday. [takes out a small piece of paper] Ah, here we go. 'Say hi to everyone in Bikini Bottom'. [runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob running up to a citizen] Hello. [citizen runs off in disgust of his bad breath. SpongeBob waves] Some people are even late on Sunday. [SpongeBob notices a mailman] Hi, Mailfish. [mailman smells SpongeBob's bad breath and he breaks his skin into a smaller fish and then into another smaller fish. SpongeBob hears a whistling noise] Hi, Mrs. Crossing Guard! [crossing guard gets a whiff of his bad breath]
Mrs. Crossing Guard: Mother of mercy! [children walk across the street and then the sound of a crashing car sounds, but it’s revealed to actually be a parade]
SpongeBob: Wow! A parade! Hi, parade! [the band stops]  Hi, tuba player, hi, drummer, hi, guy with the cymbals, hi, trumpeter, hi tambourine girl, hi, timbale man, hi, didgeridoo player, [didgeridoo player wears a big skirt, hat, sunglasses] hi, triangle player, hi, guy with the kettle drum, hi, pianist, hi, guy with the flute. And heeelllooo, Dolly! [the stench ball rolls down the street, knocking the band out like a bunch of bowling pins and scattering them about. They all run out wailing in pain and disgust. The whole town is soon deserted]
Fish bands: My leg! My leg! [they all run away from the stench]
SpongeBob: Was it something I said? [he walks down the street] Something weird is going on today. Everyone is running away from me. And now... [he notices a giant pink wad on a bench] ...giant piles of bubble gum?! Oh, what next? [Patrick's head pops out from it]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob. [his appendages form from the wad]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Patrick. I'm confused.
Patrick: Yes, I am.
SpongeBob: Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch. [he walks over to a building] Hi, building! [the stench bounces off the building, and it slowly moves away. SpongeBob walks back to Patrick] I just don't get it.
[The stench goes toward Patrick, but bounces off him, as he has no nose.]
Patrick: I don't either. Maybe it's the way you're dressed. [pan up slowly at SpongeBob's clothes, looking fancy]
Both: Nah.
Patrick: Maybe it's your voice. [SpongeBob laughs  for an extended time, then stops]
SpongeBob: Good one, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, maybe it's just because you're ugly.
SpongeBob: Ugly? [he puts a finger in his mouth, wipes his forehead with it, then strikes a pose. A spotlight goes off] You gotta be kiddin' me..
Patrick: Better try the reflection test. [he pulls out a large mirror]
SpongeBob: [to his reflection] Hi. [the stench hits his reflection, and the reflection takes a hammer and breaks the mirror. Pat peeks through it]
Patrick: Ugly.
SpongeBob: Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly! [he runs up to a couple] Am I ugly? [the two catch a whiff on the stench. The husband pulls down a hook, the two bites down on it and the hook is reeled in. SpongeBob runs off and latches onto a car's windshield] Am I ugly? [the stench goes around the glass and hits the driver's eyes]
Driver: My eyes! My eyes!
[the car swerves, spins around, throwing SpongeBob off, then explodes. All that's left is the charred frame, but a policeman gives it a ticket anyway. A tire bounces by and lands on SpongeBob, who is on the ground]
SpongeBob: Oof I'm ugly... [cut to night at SpongeBob's house. Lightning strikes repeatedly as Patrick walks in]
Patrick: SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads? [he walks through the dark house. He opens the library door. It's pitch dark, except for a light from the fire. SpongeBob mournfully plays Phantom of the Opera-style organ music. Patrick walks up to him, and he stops playing.] SpongeBob? [the lights go on, and SpongeBob turns. He's wearing a Groucho Marx-esque nose and glasses, and a dark cape. He turns his back to Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am. [he hits down on the organ]
Patrick: Sure they would! It makes them feel better about the way they look! Maybe a story will cheer you up. [he picks SpongeBob up, without glasses or cape, up and puts him in his comfy chair] It's called, 'The Ugly Barnacle.' [SpongeBob listens attentively] Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end. [Patrick grins, oblivious to his story's bad message]
SpongeBob: That didn't help at all. [he starts sobbing] How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?
Patrick: As long as I can remember. You poor ugly thing, you. [SpongeBob clings on Patrick]
SpongeBob: Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling! [Patrick smacks SpongeBob in the face, twisting his head around] Thanks, Patrick. [Patrick holds his hand up again, and SpongeBob stops him, stammering] It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over.
Patrick: Just do what I do when I have problems. [screaming] Scream! [SpongeBob is covered with spit from Patrick. Patrick grabs SpongeBob and runs off] Come on, buddy. I'll help you. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick on the roof] Okay, now, say it. [SpongeBob hesitates] Say it.
SpongeBob: I can't.
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest. [we see SpongeBob has a alien-like leach sucking on his chest]
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick. [he pulls it off and throws it aside]
Patrick: Say it. Say it.
SpongeBob: I'm ugly.
Patrick: You're ugly and what...?
SpongeBob: Square?
Patrick: No. Proud.
SpongeBob: I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Patrick: Good! Say it louder.
SpongeBob: [louder] I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Patrick: Louder.
SpongeBob: [louder] I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Patrick: Louder!
SpongeBob: [yelling] I'm ugly and I'm proud! [pan over to Squidward's roof, where he's tanning] I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud!
Squidward: Is that what he calls it? [SpongeBob is breathing heavily]
SpongeBob: That felt great! I feel empowered.
Patrick: So whaddya wanna do now?
SpongeBob: I don't know. How about a movie? [cut to 'The Reef' movie theater. SpongeBob and Patrick walk into a crowded theater. The two go down the front row] Pardon me. Ugly sponge coming through. [two fish smell SpongeBob's breath, their pupils turn to crosses, and they float upward]
Patrick: People respect self esteem. [he and SpongeBob sit down in the two now empty seats. SpongeBob leans over to a woman sitting next to him]
SpongeBob: Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway. [the stench burns the woman's eyes, complexion, and hair off, and her head is now all charred. SpongeBob leans over Patrick to the man beside Patrick, who is a blue version of Fred.] Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you.
Fred: Not at all, boy. [sniffs] Deuueaugh! [Smells SpongeBob's bad breath. Makes a sourly disgusted expression, screams out a disgusted noise, and then quickly runs away]
Patrick: [to SpongeBob] Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a- [he notices his friend crying] SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?
SpongeBob: [sobbing] I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried, [he turns around, revealing an extremely deflated face] but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide. [Patrick goes from sad to angry]
Patrick: [loudly] What is wrong with you people?! [he stands up, dropping his drinks in the process] Afraid to look ugliness in the face? [he picks up SpongeBob] Well, here! Look at it! [the stench pours into the audience] It's ugly, isn't it?! [he points SpongeBob at five people] You look at it!
SpongeBob: Hello.
[The fish run off. Patrick points SpongeBob at a larger group of people]
Patrick: You look at it!
SpongeBob: Hi.
[The fish run off.]
Patrick: [points SpongeBob at the whole audience] Look at it! [the entire room empties out] Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!

[Everybody screams in terror and they all run out of the theater in a panic. Patrick and SpongeBob are all alone in the theater]
SpongeBob: They all ran away, Patrick.
Patrick: I bet there's no line at the snack bar. [cut to the snack bar. Patrick leans over the counter] Hello...? Hello...? They must be on break.
[Patrick looks bummed out]
SpongeBob: Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered. [he reaches in his pocket and pulls out some of his sundae] I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!
[The fume of it floats past Patrick, burning off his eyebrows]
Patrick: That looks great! [closes his mouth on SpongeBob's hand, and sucks out the sundae. Patrick sighs with relief, but he starts to feel funny, His stomach makes engine spluttering noises] Oh, I gotta go to the restroom! [he runs off. Cut to the bathroom, where Patrick and Wobbles wash their hands at the sink] I'm out of soap, can I borrow- [the stench reaches the guy]
Wobbles: Stay back!
Patrick: I just want some-
[Wobbles takes out some money]
Wobbles: Here! Here's my money! [he drops it] Take it! Take it and go away!
[Wobbles runs off]
Patrick: My hands aren't that dirty... [he walks over to a line of three fish waiting at a stall] Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?
[Patrick's breath reaches the fish and they make disgusted noises.]
Clay: You tryin' to kill us?!
[The fish walkout murmuring. Patrick looks in the mirror.]
Patrick: [In shock] Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!
[SpongeBob walks in]
SpongeBob: Patrick, is everything okay in here? [he hears Patrick sobbing. He opens a stall door and sees Patrick sitting on the toilet with a bag over his head] What are you doing in there, Patrick?
Patrick: Wouldn't you like to know?
SpongeBob: And why is that bag on your head?
Patrick: Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly! [he whips the bag off. SpongeBob recoils and gasps. Patrick walks out] What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!
SpongeBob: Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.
Patrick: That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me! [his breath reaches SpongeBob and he holds his nose in disgust] I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.
SpongeBob: Patrick...?
Patrick: What's my mom gonna say?
SpongeBob: [plugging his nose] Patrick?
Patrick: Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes or even bad hair, but... [SpongeBob screams at Patrick in rage to get his attention and stop his rambling as it works]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Calmly] You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad. [Patrick sighs with relief, his stench in the shape of a skull and crossbones]
Patrick: [Relaxed]Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief...
SpongeBob: [his eyes water from the foul smell] Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?!
Patrick: Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
SpongeBob: No, I mean just this morning.
Patrick: Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
SpongeBob: What else?
Patrick: Well, I had some of your sundae.
SpongeBob: Sundae... [he whips what's remaining of it out] Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!
Patrick: Whatcha mean? [SpongeBob coughs as Patrick's breath flies by him]
SpongeBob: I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!
Patrick: Stink? [the two cheer and run around in circles chanting]
Both: We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink!
[The fumes encompass the entire theater and it dissolves to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick run out and run up to Squidward, who is looking through the window of a wig shop.]
SpongeBob: Oh, guess what, Squidward?
Both: We stink! [the two hug Squidward, and then run off, still cheering] Oh yeah! We're smelly! I reek! Smell me! [the two run off until they're out of sight]


[At the Krusty Krab, Squidward is at the ordering boat and SpongeBob is looking out from the ordering window. Mr. Krabs' voice sounds on the P.A.]
Mr. Krabs: Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention! [Mr. Krabs is standing next to them, speaking into a megaphone] Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office! [pause] That will be all. [Squidward and SpongeBob follow Mr. Krabs into his office and sit down] I have an important announcement to make.
SpongeBob: Woo! Hooray! [SpongeBob jumps up on top of the chair and twirls it around] The new spatulas are here!
Mr. Krabs:  Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulers!
Squidward: [sarcastically] How disappointing.
Mr. Krabs: You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast. [he looks at a picture of Pearl and Mr. Krabs in swim attire jumping up from the water] It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh... [puts the picture back on the wall] Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers! [a bell rings]
Pearl: [off-screen] Hello? Daddy?
Mr. Krabs: Thar she blows! [Mr. Krabs leaves the room]
Squidward: SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?
SpongeBob: No new spatulas?
Squidward: No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?
SpongeBob: Right! [SpongeBob and Squidward shake hands]
Squidward: So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions.
SpongeBob: Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs' head pokes into the office] All right, men. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk out of the office] Say hello to me Pearl.
SpongeBob: Hello, pole. [SpongeBob hugs one of the giant pillars]
Pearl: [holding a box] Hi, guys.
Mr. Krabs: It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!
Pearl: Great, dad, because I have so many new ideas.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs sniffs the air and his eyes conjoin to make a dollar sign shape] I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me! [walks off]
SpongeBob: What's in the box?
Pearl: It's a surprise.
SpongeBob: I like surprises.
Pearl: Great, then close your eyes.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob covers his eyes with his hands] I'm ready! [Pearl puts the box's open end over SpongeBob]
Squidward: Well, I like it so far.
Pearl: [Pearl lifts up the box] Ta-da... [Squidward gasps. The body suit is pink with purple flowers and on the top are two K's being held up by springs.] It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself. [Pearl hands SpongeBob a mirror]
Squidward: Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform.
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. [he winks to him] Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!
Squidward: Fish paste.
Pearl: Oh, SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu! [giggles]
Squidward: Well, I didn't think it was possible, SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual.
Pearl: Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you, too. [she holds up his uniform]
Squidward: Don't bother! Only a fool would wear that!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office, wearing the uniform] Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers? [laughs, then shuts the door. Krabs peeks his head out] Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for.
Squidward: [with the uniform on. The two springs give and the K's fall over Squidward's eyes] Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.
Pearl: Squidward is such a barnacle.
SpongeBob: A stick in the sand.
Pearl: But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style.
SpongeBob: Me? Really?
Pearl: Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me.
SpongeBob: Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here. [he looks at a picture he drew of Mr. Krabs, himself and Squidward with mustaches]
Pearl: Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess, [cut to a view of the Krusty Krab as a deserted place, where a skeleton is sitting at a table] we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise.
Pearl: [cut to Pearl with a notepad, thinking] SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?
Squidward: [Squidward runs over] For what, dare I ask?
Pearl: The new name for our new look. I mean, "The Krusty Krab" has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh! [she points the pencil towards her open mouth, to show disgust]
Squidward: Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?
Pearl: Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab? [puckers up lips and makes kissing noises]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is now in royal attire] The King Krab?
Pearl: [Pearl holds up a lollipop, which bears an odd resemblance to her father] The Kandy Krab!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob dressed as a jazzy beatnik] The Kool Krab. [dresses as a cowboy riding a stick horse] Or the Kowboy Krab! [appears totally stretched out] The Kurly Krab. [appears as a mad scientist holding a brain with Mr. Krabs-like arms coming from it] The Kreepy Krab. [Appears as a crazy killer jungle man with a loincloth. Shouts scarily.] The Killer Krab!
Pearl: [freaked out] Aaah! No!
SpongeBob: You're right, too scary. [they both think and finally get the name]
SpongeBob and Pearl: The Kuddly Krab! [Both happily hug and laugh. A rainbow of colors fills the screen. Pearl, SpongeBob and an anguished Squidward stand outside the new restaurant. The sign for the restaurant is now a heart and a cutesy robot Krabs is waving his arms atop it. The restaurant outside itself is tie-dyed with colors and rainbows and the flags are now hearts. Balloons are hanging from the roof and giant lollipops come from the chimney. Pearl and SpongeBob, giggling, walk back in the restaurant. Squidward is so mad that the two K's on his uniform catch on fire and he shakes the pole. Millie and Fred drive by in a car.]
Millie: It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab.
Fred: That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?
Squidward: That's it! I quit! [he rips off his uniform, revealing nothing under it. A police whistle is blown and a cop comes over. He writes him a ticket and places it between his legs. Inside the restaurant, it's a total makeover, like Pearl said before, it's a teenage paradise.]
Shelia: Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out! [Pearl and SpongeBob admire their restaurant]
SpongeBob: Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl.
Pearl: Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision. [blinks bashfully]
SpongeBob: Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill. [SpongeBob is in the kitchen at the grill] The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter. [he pushes his spatula on the grill and imitates a sizzle]
Pearl: [Pearl is in the ordering window to hand SpongeBob an order] SpongeBob, order up!
SpongeBob: Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a [pronounces it wrong] sa-lad? [cut to SpongeBob walking up to Pearl with a tray with two Krabby Patties] Here you go. Two sa-lads.
Pearl: Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.
SpongeBob: But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.
Pearl: Exactly.
SpongeBob: All right. [walks back to the kitchen and sadly removes the top bun] Okay, no buns. That's hip. [removes the bottom buns and top buns] No patties, [removes the patties] happenin.' [crushed] Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.
Nazz: This is so cool!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob walks over with a tray of salads to Nazz and Nancy at a table, who are talking] Two salads. [he drops the tray on the table and walks back to the kitchen] That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it. [he screams, noticing the grill is gone] Where's the grill?
Pearl: Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!
SpongeBob: Uh... right on.
Pearl: Check out this new menu I came up with. [SpongeBob takes the menu]
SpongeBob: [reading it] Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?
Pearl: Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore. [takes the spatula from SpongeBob. He starts to stutter] I've got something more fun for you to do anyway. [cut to SpongeBob outside the restaurant in a crab suit, waving at cars. One car with Gus stops]
Gus: Hey, buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention! [laughs and drives off]
SpongeBob: This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much! [he walks toward the restaurant, but gravity gets the best of him and he falls over. He struggles to get up and starts to whimper. Cut to SpongeBob at Mr. Krabs' door, outside the costume.] Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on... [he knocks on the door and peeks in] Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you? [Mr. Krabs' office is just as elaborately decorated as the rest of the restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: Come on in, me boy! Have a seat.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [he sits down in a bear bean bag chair, but starts to sink inside it]
Mr. Krabs: Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob has sunk in, now you can only see his eye] Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem.
Mr. Krabs: Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob has totally sunk into the chair and he sticks out his hand] Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news.
Mr. Krabs: How about my cuddly executive buddy? [picks up a blue stress-relief doll] Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95. [Krabs squeezes it and its eyes, nose and ears pop out]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob pops out of the chair] Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab! [he covers his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab. [goes over to a picture of a seahorse] What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers? [goes to a strand of lights] How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?! [holds one up] It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money! [starts to cry] Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?
SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way.
Mr. Krabs: That's it, boy!
SpongeBob: What's it?
Mr. Krabs: You could fire her! It's okay if she hates you.
SpongeBob: That's not what I said, sir. [Mr. Krabs brings SpongeBob to the door]
Mr. Krabs: Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office. [SpongeBob is pushed out the door and accidentally runs into Pearl]
Pearl: Totally rude, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?
Pearl: Sure, SpongeBob. [they walk to the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [thinking] How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes. [SpongeBob opens his mouth to say it, but Pearl is already crying]
Pearl: [crying] Oh, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob lets out a sigh of some relief]
Pearl: I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!
SpongeBob: Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!
Pearl: No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob thinks for a second] I got it! I can pretend to [air quotes] "fire you." I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.
Pearl: [Pearl grabs SpongeBob in a bone-snapping hug] Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!
SpongeBob: [muffled] Stop trying to break me in half?
Pearl: [Pearl drops him] Deal. [cut to SpongeBob and Pearl walking up to Mr. Krabs' door, Pearl tries to conceal her laughing] Oh, boy!
SpongeBob: Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing. [loud and clear] Pearl, I need to have a word with you! [we see Mr. Krabs in his office, sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen.
SpongeBob: It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that...
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs is pushed against the door] Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way? [he sees himself in the uniform in the mirror] It's for the best.
SpongeBob: Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if...
Mr. Krabs: I can't let him do this! [he goes for the door, then sees the vault open. It's empty, and a spider crawls around its web] Get on with it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Pearl, you're fired. [Mr. Krabs chokes and falls over]
Pearl: Thanks, SpongeBob. [kisses him. She runs off and jumps into a car with all her friends] Come on, gang, the mall awaits! [they drive off. SpongeBob runs into the office]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it! [he screams when he sees Mr. Krabs' body. He runs over to a bill behind glass, which is for emergency purposes and he breaks the glass. He waves the bill under Mr. Krabs' nose.]
Mr. Krabs: [regaining consciousness] Oh, Pearly... [sniffs] Is that a $20? [he pockets the bill] Oh, SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood? [cries]
SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy.
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: She's off to bigger and better things.
Mr. Krabs: That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man! [laughs] But how am I gonna get my money back for all this stuff? [SpongeBob thinks. Cut to his house, where all the stuff is put up in his house. SpongeBob dances in his uniform to the music]
SpongeBob: [laughing] Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!
Gary: [Gary is covered in stuffed animals and his shell has flowers painted on it] Meow?


Narrator: Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life. [chuckles] Well, you know. [Patrick is sleeping and the mailfish walks by and puts a box in his open mouth as he is yawning and waking up, he grabs it and quickly opens it, and it turns out to be a shiny, gold trophy]
Patrick: An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award. [antenna on top of rock breaks] Jellyfish, I got an award. [jellyfish zap him and he jumps up above the surface] Island, I got an awar... [chokes for air and floats back down] I gotta show SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [building a house of cards looking like Gary] Hold still, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Almost done. [Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor; Gary flies away]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.[SpongeBob falls down to the floor]
SpongeBob: That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
Patrick: See for yourself.
SpongeBob: [his body is facedown, but his face come out and reads the award] "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?"
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
Patrick: But, it's shiny. [SpongeBob takes the trophy]
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
Patrick: Ice cream!
SpongeBob: Exactly!
Patrick: I can find it. Is it in here?
SpongeBob: No, don't! That's my... [Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet] ...award closet.
Patrick: I want an award! [starts to cry]
SpongeBob: [has two 1st place ribbons in his eyes] Aww, Patrick, don't cry. [Patrick starts sobbing loudly and wildly going away from the awards] You'll get an award one day.
Patrick: I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.
SpongeBob: But you're Patrick... [jumps on Patrick and his eyes turn into stars] Star. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.
Patrick: Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
SpongeBob: Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
Patrick: I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
SpongeBob: Smaller. [shrinks]
Patrick: Doctor?
SpongeBob: Smaller. [shrinks more]
Patrick: Fireman?
SpongeBob: [In a tiny voice] The smallest you can think of. [shrinks even more]
Patrick: A job at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Yeah! [grows to normal size] I do things at work all the time.
Patrick: Then let's go. [Patrick runs off, pulling off SpongeBob's arm]
Patrick: Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.
SpongeBob: And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?
Squidward: Guess who just quit? [puts his hat on Patrick's head and then leaves]
Patrick: Do I get my award yet?
SpongeBob: You have to work for it, remember?
Patrick: Tartar sauce. [SpongeBob flipping patties]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob places the order in the window] Pick up order! [Patrick comes and eats the order]
Patrick: Do I get my award, now?
SpongeBob: No, you have to take the tray to the customer.
Patrick: Ok. [tray gets to table but with no food; Patrick burps]
SpongeBob: Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table. [Patrick arrives with food on tray but then eats it as he sits down]
Patrick: Like that?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Patrick: [spits out food at the customer as he talks] Barnacles!
SpongeBob: Let's try something different.
SpongeBob: All you have to do is answer the phone.
Patrick: Aye aye, Captain! [phone rings]
Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: No, this is Patrick. [hangs up and starts whistling; phone rings again]
Girl on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: [annoyed] No, this is Patrick! [hangs up and continues to whistle; phone rings yet again]
Another Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: [angry] No! This is Patrick! [puts phone down and folds his arms] I'm not a Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
Patrick: Huh? Oh...Fishpaste!
SpongeBob: It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out? [hands Patrick a broom]
Patrick: What's the point? I can't do anything right.
SpongeBob: You'll do fine. [Patrick sweeps with the handle side of the broom instead of the head]
Nat: [approaches Patrick] Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown? [continues drinking]
SpongeBob: Keep trying, Patrick.
Delivery Guy: I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants. [Patrick becomes furious and sweeps harder]
Patrick: Why can't I do anything right?! [bangs the head of the broom on the floor making dust rise all over the Krusty Krab's dining area, which makes the nearby customers start coughing]
SpongeBob: [pushing Patrick] Kitchen!
Patrick: [throws the broom to the floor] I'm never gonna get an award, now.
SpongeBob: Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar. [gets a jar and opens the lid] Easy. Now you try. First get a jar. [Patrick gets out a pickle] Patrick, that's a pickle.
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: You need a jar. [Patrick picks up a spatula] No. [Patrick takes his pants off] No. [Patrick picks up SpongeBob] No. Try...this! [gives Patrick a jar] Now take the lid off the jar. [puts the lid in his mouth] Just relax. Lift your hand. [Patrick lifts his hand] Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. [puts his hand on counter] No, the lid. [slides his hand to the corner of the counter] [Patrick tries for the lid over and over as SpongeBob keeps telling him "the lid", Patrick pants due to exhaustion; few seconds later, Patrick is almost there] Freeze! [hand is on the side of the jar] Almost there. Now head for the lid. [hand goes lower] Cold. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!
SpongeBob: Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, you did it!
SpongeBob: That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.
Patrick: Yeah. Remember when I had my hand up? And I put it on the lid?
SpongeBob: That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [Patrick copies SpongeBob then SpongeBob stops] Huh?
SpongeBob: Well, back to the ol' grind.
Patrick: Well, back to the ol' grind.
SpongeBob: Forget my hat.
Patrick: Uh, me, too.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob mops the floor then puts the mop up; Patrick mops the floor but he makes the floor wet; SpongeBob comes out with a handful of plates and slips and breaks them all; Patrick follows in SpongeBob's footsteps; SpongeBob glares at him]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [at the grill, frying patties, both whistle a tune, then stop, they both wipe their foreheads] Whew! [SpongeBob drops his spatula]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Dropped my spatula. [bends down to pick it up]
Patrick: Uhh, me, too. [drops spatula and bends down to pick it up; SpongeBob takes off his hat, then Patrick takes off his, they both put their hats back on, then they both put their hands on the grill; Patrick's hand burns after a few seconds] Ow!
SpongeBob: Aha! [shows the fake hand] You're copying me!
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Why are you doing that?
Patrick: So I can win an award like you.
SpongeBob: Well, it's annoying, so stop it!
Patrick: Stop it. [both imitate the others facial expressions]
SpongeBob: Say, you're good.
Patrick: Thanks.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ha! Darn. [both look at each other with suspicion, while rubbing their chins] Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as...pickle fish lips! [both cover their mouths] Sea weavle. Gorgy smorgy.
SpongeBob: [in his head] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
Patrick: [in his head] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [screaming]
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick run out of the Krusty Krab] Stop copying me!
Patrick: There's no award for that!
Squidward: [leaning against the Krusty Krab sign pole, reading a newspaper, a Krusty Krab hat falls near him] Well, I guess it's safe to go in now. [puts hat back on and walks back in]
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick are still running] Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?
Patrick: Until I have as many awards as you.
SpongeBob: We'll see about that!
Patrick: No, we won't.
SpongeBob: [takes out a jump-rope] I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: Me, too. [takes out a jump-rope]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice. [crosses arms and jump-ropes while Patrick tries to imitate but ties himself up with his rope] Ha! Not a scratch on me. [body breaks down into pieces]
Patrick: Oh, no, you don't! [squeezes the rope on himself breaking his body down into smaller pieces, then both hit a hammer on their heads]
SpongeBob: Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?
Patrick: Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you. [SpongeBob stops hammering his head but Patrick does not notice; Patrick hits himself faster and too hard, he stops and gets dizzy, trophies appear and spin around his head, and falls on the ground; SpongeBob runs into Patrick's rock painted as SpongeBob's house; SpongeBob gets angry and steam comes out of his head]
Patrick: My turn! [runs into the pineapple rock]
SpongeBob: [runs into his house] I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me. [pushes his nose into his face and comes out of his house dressed in Patrick's normal outfit] Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.
Patrick: What's so great about being a big pink loser? [SpongeBob's nose pops back out] Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick...
Patrick: Patrick's not here!
Delivery Guy: [stops in front of SpongeBob and Patrick in truck] Trophy delivery! [he drives off and SpongeBob has a package in his mouth]
SpongeBob: Another trophy?
Patrick: [sarcastically] Oh, great! [SpongeBob opens the package] What's it for THIS time?
SpongeBob: 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'. Patrick! This trophy's for you!
Patrick: Yay! [puts trophy on his head like a hat] Eee! [both rip off their present outfits to reveal their own normal outfits]
SpongeBob: So, what are you gonna do, now?
Patrick: I'm gonna go protect my title. [jumps on his rock and falls asleep, the rock closes]
Narrator: So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock.


Narrator: Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up.
SpongeBob: [jumps out of bed] Hey everybody! It's Leif Erikson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgen! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Erikson Day! There's a note.
Patrick: [as note] SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Erikson Day! Yingin-hinga-dinga! 
SpongeBob: Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me. [throws his costume away] Another note. 
Sandy: [as note] SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy. 
SpongeBob: I don't get it. The water's fine. [scene shows the treedome snowing inside] Hey, Squidward! Want to play? 
Squidward: [as note] No. 
SpongeBob: Are you sure? 
Squidward: [as note] Yes. 
SpongeBob: Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy! [lets go of the stick which falls to the ground] Nah... [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a pile of rocks] Rock Buddy! Nope... [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a sink] Sink Buddy! "[Sink Buddy drips a little water]" Almost... [scene cuts to SpongeBob again] I've got it! [dips his bubble wand into bubble soap and blows a human shape-like bubble] Bubble Buddy! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Bubble Buddy on the seesaw] This...is...great! [scene cuts to SpongeBob going up to the Krusty Krab with his bubble] I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob walks in the Krusty Krab but his bubble just floats at the door] Don't be shy, come on! [SpongeBob squeezes the bubble through the doors] 
Squidward: Please come again. When I'm not working. Next. 
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! 
Squidward: How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway? 
SpongeBob: I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy! 
Squidward: This bubble is your friend? [sees his reflection in Bubble Buddy's face; giggles] Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be? 
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not hungry. 
Squidward: Well, thanks for stopping by. 
SpongeBob: Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet! 
Squidward: Why would I do that? 
SpongeBob: He's hungry. 
Squidward: He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here! 
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the register] What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here. [a criminal is eating a Krabby Patty] At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds. 
Squidward: I'm not taking an order for a bubble. 
Mr. Krabs: Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe. [goes back to the cash register, then he peeks at Squidward] Even if you quit. [goes back into the cash register again] 
Squidward: May I take your order? 
SpongeBob: Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you. [reads the menu] Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything. [Mr. Krabs explodes through the cash register] 
Mr. Krabs: One of everything?! Whoopee! [rips off his shirt and applies a tattoo on himself that has a heart and the words "Bubble Buddy" through it] I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table. [points his eyes to a table in the opposite direction] 
SpongeBob: Bubble Buddy's thirsty. 
Squidward: How about a glass of our finest shampoo? [laughs] 
SpongeBob: Sounds great! [Squidward looks annoyed that he took his comment literally, walks off and returns with a shampoo bottle with a straw in it] 
Squidward: Here's your hair care product, sir. 
SpongeBob: Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws. [Squidward bends the straw] Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think? 
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [chews and spits a Krabby Patty for an old lady to eat] Think of the customer. 
Squidward: [drinks shampoo] Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy. 
SpongeBob: Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties! 
Squidward: And? 
SpongeBob: Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do? 
Squidward: We? How about you take these patties and sh... 
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen; cutting him off] Mr. Squidward! [Squidward frowns in annoyance; he takes back the patty and walks off with the cart] 
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch. 
Squidward: What, is he allergic to bread, too? 
SpongeBob: Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... 
Squidward: Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style! [sets a bigger ferris wheel on the table] And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask. 
SpongeBob: That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs waves] 
Mr. Krabs: So long, boys! You see, Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day. 
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab. [hands Mr. Krabs a $100 bill made of bubbles] 
Mr. Krabs: What's this? 
Squidward: Bubble money. [$100 bill pops. Squidward shows his hand full of bubble change] At least they left a tip! [all the bubbles pop as Mr. Krabs and Squidward start growling with fury. Scene cuts to Goo Lagoon] 
SpongeBob: Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here. [Scooter runs up to SpongeBob] 
Scooter: Dudes, bury me! [laughs] 
SpongeBob: See what I mean? [fade cut] All done! 
Scooter: [buried under the sand] All right! 
SpongeBob: Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy. 
Scooter: Don't just stand there, dude. The tide's coming in. [laughs. Water reaches him] Dude? 
SpongeBob: [places Bubble Buddy inside] My friend's in there. 
Harold: Congratulations. 
SpongeBob: [goes to the music and he dances along] Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah! [everyone looks at their rears and they leave in embarrassment] 
Pearl: It's the world-famous surf punk, Grubby Grouper! 
Grubby Grouper: Later, groupies! [shakes Pearl's hand] Grubby's got to go catch some gnarly pounders. Ahoo! 
Pearl: [looks at her fin which is dirty now] Oh, I'll never wash this flipper again. [SpongeBob walks up with Bubble Buddy] 
SpongeBob: Hey, Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy! [rubs Bubble Buddy's hands on Pearl's dirty flipper, her flipper is now clean. Pearl sobs. Scene cuts to the port-o-potty] It's his first time on his own. 
Harold: Once again, congratulations. [later, the line is longer. Picture scrolls over to where we see a sign that reads '45 minutes from this point'] 
Man: Popcorn! Peanuts! 
Lou: [sounding desperate] Ice cold drinks! 
Harold: [camera stops on Harold and SpongeBob as SpongeBob whistles and Peterson struggles to hold it in. Unable to take the wait anymore] Two hours is long enough! That's it! [opens the port-o-potty door to see Bubble Buddy] 
SpongeBob: Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished! [takes Bubble Buddy away, leaving everybody to glare at them] 
Francis: He kept us waiting for a bubble? 
Larry: That's nothing! He called us fat! [along with others, he begins crunching on celery stalk] 
Pearl: [crying as she shows her clean flipper] He washed my flipper! 
Mr. Krabs: [storming up] He owes me money! 
Squidward: [following Mr. Krabs] He made me provide excellent service! 
Scooter: [appears with a halo and angel clothing on] Dudes! He made me experience high tide! [floats up towards the surface while laughing] 
Tom: He poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses! 
Protesters: He did? 
Tom: No... But are we just gonna wait around until he does? 
Mr. Krabs: I say we tip something over! [all yelling] 
Lifeguard: Hey, hey, hey! [everyone tips the lifeguard stand] 
Protester: Now what? 
Protesters: Get the lifeguard! [they go to the lifeguard, but Squidward stops them] 
Squidward: Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems! [holds up a needle] Who's with me? 
Protesters: [all hold a needle] Pop the bubble! [all yelling] 
SpongeBob: [everybody surrounds them] Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy? 
Protesters: Yes... 
SpongeBob: Hey, is this one of those sewing circles? 
Protesters: No... [group steps in closer] 
SpongeBob: Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable. 
Larry: SpongeBob, that bubble's got to go. 
SpongeBob: Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern. 
Pearl: No. "Go" as in... [blows a bubble gum until it pops] 
SpongeBob: [screams] Why?! 
Mr. Krabs: You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it! 
SpongeBob: No! I won't let you! [blows Bubble Buddy until they begin floating] Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never! [both start to get lower to the ground and the group surrounds them both again] Never... 
Squidward: Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble! 
Protesters: Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! 
SpongeBob: No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend? 
Mr. Krabs: [starts crying] Nickel Buddy, I'll never spend you! 
Sheldon: Funny Muffler... 
Larry: Jerky Pal... 
Harold: Boo-boo Keys... 
Man: Snake Eyes... [together with Harold] We love you! [burst into tears] 
SpongeBob: So, what do you say? 
Protesters: [look at each other, then they bring out their needles] Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! [throw SpongeBob away] 
Squidward: Let's get this over with so I can go home and play my clarinet! 
SpongeBob: Noo... [Squidward charges his needle towards Bubble Buddy in a slow dramatic manner, while SpongeBob begs them to stop. But then suddenly Bubble Buddy grabs ahold of Squidward's hand before the needle reaches the former] 
Bubble Buddy: Whoa! [all except SpongeBob gasp] Hey, don't I get a say in this? I'll see you later, SpongeBob. Things are getting a little weird around here. 
SpongeBob: So long. [Bubble Buddy gets into a bubble taxi and it floats away as it drives off] 
Bubble Buddy: Happy Leif Erikson Day! 
Squidward: He's alive? 
SpongeBob: Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes! [laughs as everyone walks off muttering and agreeing with Bubble Buddy's departure] Seems like only this morning I held his bottle. [sniffles] They blow up so fast. [weeps tears of joy while blowing his nose and runs off. A bunch of bubbles pop near Squidward except for one] 
Squidward: [thinking bubble is alive like Bubble Buddy] Uh...hi?


[Squidward is dressed in island clothes and playing the piano on an island (the future version of Bikini Bottom). He hits one of the notes, but realizes it's a sour note and he keeps hitting it. The sound is coming from SpongeBob hitting a bell.]
Dream SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward! [Squidward wakes up from his dream while his alarm clock goes off. Cuts to Squidward driving to work. Zooms in on one of his bumper stickers that reads "Don't Ask Me About My Day." Squidward blearily looks up from his steering wheel to prepare himself for the day ahead. He walks up to the front doors and SpongeBob follows him from inside, smiling. Squidward walks inside]
SpongeBob: Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me? [Squidward walks inside without saying a word] Okay, see you later, Squidinator.
Mr. Krabs: Good morning, Mr. Squidward. [Raises his eyebrows; Squidward sticks out his tongue] So, are you ready?
Squidward: To go home?
Mr. Krabs: No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards... [points at SpongeBob] ...that guy! [SpongeBob is washing a table with a buffer. He scrubs his face and gets it scrambled. He laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for ye.
SpongeBob: Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift. [holds up a sweater] Ta-dah. [zooms in to show it's a picture of a heart with Squidward's face on it]
Squidward: "I Heart you..."
Mr. Krabs: Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it. [laughs as Squidward has a hard time putting the sweater over his head]
SpongeBob: I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size. [Squidward gets the sweater over his head] Do you love it?
Squidward: [starts scratching the sweater] It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of? [cut to SpongeBob with no eyelashes or eyebrows]
SpongeBob: Eyelashes! [Squidward throws the sweater at SpongeBob, causing him to whimper]
Squidward: Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?
Mr. Krabs: After you present your brotherhood gift.
Squidward: I'll buy the little twerp a Gumball.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift.
Squidward: [walks to the doors] The only thing I'm making is for the exit. [opens up the door to see SpongeBob with a new sweater made out of a clear liquid]
SpongeBob: Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears. [sniffs. Squidward sighs and walks towards the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice.
Squidward: Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?
Captain: Heave-ho! [Squidward looks and sees some pirates outside carrying some pies onto the ship] If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!
Squidward: Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.
Pirate: Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs.
Squidward: Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one. [holds up money]
Captain: Wait! [jumps down off the ship] We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please.
Squidward: So, what flavor is it?
Pirates: [all talking at once] Cherry. Apple. Raspberry.
Squidward: Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back. [Squidward gives the pirate the money. Cut to Squidward placing the pie on Mr. Krabs' desk] Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.
Mr. Krabs: Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right. [about to put a piece in his mouth] Wait a second... this would go great with some milk! [while walking to the milk, he trips over a book and the piece of pie flies into the milk, causing an explosion] So, you tried to kill me over a little new age management, eh?
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain! [cut to inside Mr. Krabs' office]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie! [looks at the card attached to it] It's from Squidward. [reading] "To SpongeBob... Well, here you go."
Squidward: And that's what happened!
Mr. Krabs: 25 dollars?! A bomb?!
Squidward &amp; Mr. Krabs: [shouting] In the Krusty Krab?! [both run back into the office but the pie is not there]
Mr. Krabs: That's where you left it.
Squidward: It's not there.
SpongeBob: Hey guys. [licks his fingers then rubs his tummy] Thanks for the pie, Squidward. [sings] La, la, lalalalalala. [skips out]
Mr. Krabs: You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears... and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?
Squidward: Kill him? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob taking a tray to a customer]
SpongeBob: Here's your order, sir.
Customer: Thanks. [SpongeBob explodes and pieces of SpongeBob fly everywhere; back to reality]
Squidward: No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!
Mr. Krabs: Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!
Squidward: You've seen this before?
Mr. Krabs: Eleven times as a matter of fact. [Squidward runs over to a phone and dials the hospital]
Squidward: Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times? [hangs up] Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him? [both look out the window and see SpongeBob cheerfully wiping off a table, apparently having forgotten about the earlier incident]
Mr. Krabs: Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours. [walks away]
Squidward: [tears up] You're right, Mr. Krabs! [sobs] I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it. [opens the door then turns around, smiling] Drown in it! [walks out]
Mr. Krabs: [writes on a notepad] Note to self: Watch out for Squidward. [Cut to Squidward walking over to SpongeBob, who is singing happily and wiping the table]
Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [sing-songy] Yes?
Squidward: I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift.
SpongeBob: Part two? [bounces up and down] Part two, part two, part two, part two... [Squidward grabs him]
Squidward: Please, don't do that.
SpongeBob: What's the part two?
Squidward: Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of? [SpongeBob takes out a list]
SpongeBob: Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list.
Squidward: Great. Uh, let me see it. [looks at the list]
SpongeBob: The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.
Squidward: Everything's in red.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I know.
Squidward: We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.
SpongeBob: Then let's roll! [both walk out] Bye, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs cries and puts a "Help Wanted" sign in the window] Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you.
Squidward: Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.
SpongeBob: Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to a businessman] Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to some kids] Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward. [one of the kids throws a rock at Squidward's head. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking up to a fish sitting on a bench] Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward.
Squidward: Hey, Frank. [montage ends] Glad that's over.
SpongeBob: Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity.
Squidward: Which is...?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.
Squidward: You're gonna be wearing a salmon suit?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one Squidward! [cut to Squidward in a salmon suit in front of some kids. All the kids throw rocks at him. Cut to SpongeBob checking off the item on his list] Next. [SpongeBob and Squidward sit by a rock] Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.
Squidward: Who's there?
SpongeBob: I am! [laughs]
Squidward: [laughs weakly] Oh, yeah... [SpongeBob checks the knock-knock jokes off his list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking backwards]
SpongeBob: [imitates the beeping of a back up alarm] Look out, everyone, friends in reverse! [continues beeping. SpongeBob checks off this item off the list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward making noises with their tongues out of their mouths while moving their hands back and forth in front of their face. SpongeBob checks the item off his list. Cut to Squidward walking with SpongeBob as his face]
SpongeBob: Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.
Squidward:  [muffled] I can't breathe. [SpongeBob checks that off his list. Cut to SpongeBob performing open-heart surgery on Squidward]
Squidward: Are you sure you should be poking it like that?
SpongeBob: Who's the doctor here? [heart squirts blood. SpongeBob checks his operation off the list as well as some other items while he laughs] The last thing on the list is...
Squidward: [with a bandage over his heart] Does it involve more dismemberment?
SpongeBob: Watch the sunset with Squidward.
Squidward: Sunset? [thinks about what Mr. Krabs said earlier in a thought balloon]
Mr. Krabs: The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.
SpongeBob: Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs cries and runs off] Okay, see you later.
Squidward: C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.
SpongeBob: Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me, [a brick wall is shown between the two] ...and this brick wall that you built between us.
Squidward: Yeah. [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob exploding]
Squidward: Explosions... I mean, erosion. 
SpongeBob: You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay. [Squidward tears up. SpongeBob burps] Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine. [smells the aroma] Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry? [the sun starts to go down] Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.
Squidward: Four... three... two... one... [nothing happens]
SpongeBob: I guess we started too early. Let's start again.
Squidward: Five... four... three... [an explosion is heard from behind the wall] two... [cries] o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful. [he sighs] I am such a good person. [another explosion is seen behind the wall but this time, it knocks the brick wall down on top of Squidward. SpongeBob is blowing some bomb-shaped bubbles]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out! [Squidward gets up and mutters] Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.
Squidward: Why are you still here?!
SpongeBob: Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one. [holds up a book that says "Friends 4 Ever"] I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.
Squidward: [slaps book away] Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!
SpongeBob: You want me to explode?
Squidward: Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!
SpongeBob: Um, okay, I'll try. [grunts and then yells] Gary! You are gonna finish your desert, and you are gonna like it! [laughs] Now it's your turn!
Squidward: [yells and stomps on the ground] That's not what I meant you barnacle head!
SpongeBob: Oh, good one.
Squidward: No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces! [he flaps his arms]
SpongeBob: Why would I do that?
Squidward: Because the pie you ate was a bomb!
SpongeBob: What pie?
Squidward: The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!
SpongeBob: Pie...pie... [takes out a pie] Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat! [walks forward and trips on a rock] Oops! [pie flies into Squidward's face in slow-motion causing an explosion the size of an atomic bomb]
Squidward: [now in the destroyed town] Ouch. [fade to black, episode ends]


Narrator: Ah, Sandy Cheeks is going out of town and has asked SpongeBob and Patrick to do a little pet-sitting for her. [inside the dome are a few animals in cages and/or jars]
Patrick: Pet-sitting? Won't that hurt them? [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a bird cage]
Narrator: Perhaps she should have asked someone else. [Patrick whistles at the bird]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird.
Patrick: No, that's Italian, SpongeBob. [Sandy puts a big sack down]
Sandy: Okay boys, this here is Birdy's food. Feed him twice a day.
SpongeBob: This whole sack?
Sandy: No, just a cup's worth. [all walk over to a cricket] This here's my cricket. [the cricket makes noises] He's saying hello to you. Ain't he cute?
SpongeBob: Uh sorry, I don't speak Italian.
Sandy: And this here's Snakey. [holds up the snake that has a mouse in its belly]
SpongeBob: What's that lump in its belly?
Sandy: Well, that's his dinner. [SpongeBob pokes it and the mouse laughs] Well, I guess that's it. I gotta go. [walks off with a suitcase] See you guys in a couple of days.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bye, Sandy! [notices the worm in a jar]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Wait! You forgot about this pet!
Sandy: Oh, that's only Wormy. He don't eat much. [walks out]
SpongeBob: Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella.
Patrick: Kitchie-kitchie koo, koo.
SpongeBob: Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play. [cut to SpongeBob playing hide-n-seek and counting] 998, 999, 1,000. Ready or not, here I come! [turns around and takes the table cover off of Patrick's head]
Patrick: You found me. [both look for Wormy, who is on a leaf]
SpongeBob and Patrick: There you are! [cuts to Sponge and Pat hiding behind a tree. Wormy pops up behind it] He found us! [they laugh]
Patrick: Gee, SpongeBob, I don't want today to end ever.
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy. [puts a 'Best Friend' ribbon on Wormy] Our new best friend. [puts Wormy back in his jar] Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy. We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun.
Patrick: Why must the sun set on this perfect day? Sleep well, Wormy. [Patrick cries as they both walk home]
SpongeBob: Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. It's only until tomorrow.
[cut to the Bikini Atoll island as day turns into night. Meanwhile, back at Sandy's treedome, a now live-action Wormy sheds his skin one last time, turns himself into a chrysalis, then emerges from said chrysalis, now as a butterfly. The next morning, the rooster crows and SpongeBob wakes up.]
SpongeBob: Here I come, Wormy! [Patrick pokes his head out of SpongeBob's alarm clock]
Patrick: Me, too! [both run off to Sandy's with their water helmets already on] And then we're gonna play tag, and then we're gonna color, and then we're gonna build a house of cards!
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're back, Wormy! Wormy, Wormy? [holds up the jar with Wormy in it, who is now a butterfly]
Patrick: Wormy? Where's Wormy? What's that thing?
SpongeBob: He's gotta be in here. [he opens up the jar, causing Wormy to fly out] I think something bad happened to Wormy. [the best friend ribbon is still in the jar]
Patrick: He left his "Best Friend" ribbon behind!
[the butterfly flies onto SpongeBob's helmet. Cue a live-action close-up of a buzzing horsefly's face. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run behind Sandy's table.]
Patrick: What is that thing?! [the butterfly is on the tree]
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy!
Patrick: [In tears] Why does this keep happening to me?!
SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick! We've gotta make a run for the door! [They start to run to the exit but the butterfly flies in front of the door] No! Patrick, it’s blocking our only exit! [They begin to run backwards to the back of Sandy's tree]
Patrick: Now what? We're trapped in here with that... that... "Best Friend Eater!"
SpongeBob: Let's not panic. We just have to stick together. Remember, it's two against one. Right, Patrick? Patrick? [He sees Patrick gone and the butterfly flying at him and shrieks] It’s eaten Patrick! [He runs away and jumps in a barrel and sees Patrick in it] Patrick, you're alive!
Patrick: I am?
SpongeBob: Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house. It might eat Sandy's other pets!
Patrick: Or worse, it might eat Sandy's pets.
SpongeBob: No, it might eat Sandy! We've gotta get it out of here!
[We see SpongeBob and Patrick hiding behind Sandy's table and Sandy's phone in a jar to trap the butterfly and the phone begins to ring.]
Patrick: It's for you! [The butterfly begins to fly by the jar]
SpongeBob: It's working. It’s gonna answer it. [But instead the butterfly just flies past the jar and the lid closes]
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
[Then we see Patrick on a plate with an apple in his mouth]
SpongeBob: You look pretty appetizing, Patrick. Now, just stay here and wait for the monster. I'll go get the net. [He walks off and the butterfly begins to fly by and land on Patrick's butt which makes Patrick feel scared]
Patrick: [Whimpering, spitting out the apple] SpongeBob! Hurry up with that net!
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick! [He searches through Sandy's trunk for the net.]
Patrick: I really don't taste that good, Monster. [Wormy crawls down Patrick's helmet. Patrick sees the butterfly close-up and runs off screaming. SpongeBob runs by with the net]
SpongeBob: I'm coming, Patrick! [Patrick goes right through the net, tearing it up, and crashes into the tree, causing some acorns to fall into his helmet. SpongeBob sees his broken net as Wormy corners him] No, Monster, please don't eat me! No, no, no! Spare me, I don't taste good, no! Please! Wait a second. [takes out a bottle of bubbles and blows one to get Wormy stuck in one] Yeah! [Wormy flies out of the treedome, still in the bubble. Patrick shuts the door behind Wormy] We did it, Patrick! Sandy's gonna be so proud of us. We got that horrible monster out of her house and best of all her pets are safe. 'Cause that horrible creature is now...[Wormy flies to the Krusty Krab]...heading straight for the Krusty Krab! [both run off] It's going in the front! Let's use the secret entrance. [both go inside a rock and then appear inside the Krusty Krab in another rock. They gasp as Wormy flies toward Squidward and Mr. Krabs, who are taking pictures]
Squidward: Okay, hold still.
Patrick: It's gonna eat Squidward and Mr. Krabs! [both jump at them]
SpongeBob: Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Say "money."
Mr. Krabs: "Money!" [Squidward takes the picture. It reveals SpongeBob and Patrick jumping on top of Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: What's the meaning of this, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there.
Mr. Krabs: Is it a paying customer?
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties. It wants to eat YOU!
Patrick: [crying] Just like it ate Wormy!
Squidward: Um, Wormy? [SpongeBob and Patrick cry]
SpongeBob: Why? Why? He was so young.
Patrick: We’ll never forget you, Wormy.
Squidward: Well, if Moron Theater's over, I'm just going to take a look at this monster. [Wormy flies in a bubble] That's the monster?
Patrick: Pretty scary, huh?
SpongeBob: A living nightmare!
Squidward: I should have known. [walks away] Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express.
Mr. Krabs: Now just 'cause you swabs never seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous.
SpongeBob: We tried to warn them. I can't watch. [pushes his eyes into his head]
Squidward: Get a load of the scary monster. [laughs] Monster.
Mr. Krabs: Aww, it looks harmless...
Squidward: It's kinda cute.
Mr. Krabs: It reminds me of money!
Squidward: Monster. [both laugh until they see the butterfly up-close and personal. Squidward and Mr. Krabs scream as their teeth and eyes fall out and they both run away.]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Patrick: Mr. Krabs? [SpongeBob screams when he sees their underwear and hat only]
SpongeBob: [screams] It ate them! And there it goes! [Wormy flies out of the Krusty Krab] First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs! [has three finger puppets for each person] That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must inform the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The faith of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll.
Patrick: Aye-aye, captain. [pushes a lever to make the boat sail out of the Krusty Krab. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick on the streets]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity.
Patrick: Gotcha.
SpongeBob: Run, everybody, run!
Patrick: Monster on the loose!
SpongeBob: Monster! [everyone runs away screaming. SpongeBob and Patrick give each other a thumbs up. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick putting up a sign of the butterfly saying "Beware" when a crowd of citizens runs by screaming. Wormy flies by and SpongeBob and Patrick hide in the bucket of glue and bounce off. Cut to SpongeBob inflating a balloon but then inhales the air in the balloon so he can float in the sky.]
Patrick: [using a megaphone] Attention, Bikini Bottom! There's a flying monster that's going to eat you!
Fish #1, Gerbil, TV Fish, and Fish #2:  A monster?! [everyone screams and runs away. Cut to SpongeBob waving his arms and horrifyingly pointing at Wormy flying by. Everybody runs off, and in the commotion, a lamppost gets knocked over and the whole city is set on fire.]
Realistic Fish Head: Attention, attention! This just in! [TV shows a real monarch butterfly] A giant monster is attacking Bikini Bottom. [a man watching the announcement swallows his eyes and has them appear in his mouth when he screams. He runs through the wall]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved the city! [In the background, a meteor flies down and destroys a building] Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster.
Patrick: About the what? [just then, Wormy flies by. SpongeBob, Patrick, and everyone else run away from Wormy, but Wormy always finds them no matter where they go. Eventually, the crowd stops at a traffic light to allow another crowd through. The first crowd passes as well, and soon enough, Wormy stops at the light, too. The crowd runs inside of a building, and Wormy enters as well. In the struggle to get out, all of the citizens are ejected through the chimney. Cut to the crowd running. As SpongeBob screams, his mouth engulfs the camera. Bikini Bottom's welcome sign snaps in half, and a "Beware" poster drifts through the wind. Then, a bus drops off Sandy. Sandy sees the destroyed town.]
Sandy: Shoot! Looks like a twister hit this place. Where is everybody? [Wormy flies by] Oh, hey there Wormy. [puts him in a jar] You weren't supposed to change till I got back. That oughta hold ya, little guy. [everyone runs up to Sandy, SpongeBob also gives Sandy a hug.] Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Sandy caught the monster! [everyone cheers and picks up SpongeBob and Sandy and bring them into town]
Sandy: I didn't know I'd be missed so much. Golly, maybe I should go out of town more often.


[Episode starts with the Krusty Krab. Inside, it is dirty and covered in cobwebs. Squidward is seen covered in dust and cobwebs. He blows the dust off himself. SpongeBob dusts off a cobweb off a table with a feather duster. A spider comes down and makes a new web. SpongeBob dusts it off again, but the spider comes back and makes another one. Mr. Krabs is seen covered in dust against the wall. He sneezes the dust off.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah-ah-achoo! [sighs] 36 days without a customer.
Dave: [slowly crawls towards the Krusty Krab] So... hungry...
SpongeBob: Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer!
Mr. Krabs: Ah! [Krabs squeals in delight, revealing a spider web growing in his mouth. A spider crawls all over it]
Dave: No food... 3 days...
Mr. Krabs: Hold on, me bucko! Food's on the way! [He is about to call into the kitchen, but then has a second thought] Uhh... You got money, right?
Dave: Yeah...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Bring this guy some grub before he keels over!
SpongeBob: [offers him food] Here you go, sir.
Dave: Oh. Krabby Patties, huh?
Mr. Krabs: Finest under the sea!
Dave: Yeah, yeah, sure. But where's the pizzazz?
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Dave: I mean look at this place. [the inside of the Krusty Krab is all old and worn out] I mean... what is the theme here? Underwater? It's boring. [He turns and crawls away] Foooood... water... atmosphere...
Mr. Krabs: Nobody goes to a restaurant for atmosphere. [runs to the door] They go for food! [he looks out the door as Fred and Tom see each other on the street]
Fred: Hey, Tom!
Tom: Fred! Hey, you wanna eat at the Krusty Krab?
Fred: Nah. Let's go to the Shell Shack. They've got a talking dog!
Tom: [runs off with Fred] Great! Say, what's a dog?
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] Money walking! I need to think up a gimmick like that to bring people back in here!
SpongeBob: [peeks through Mr. Krabs' eye stalks] I have an idea! [Mr. Krabs' eye stalks pull back together, chopping SpongeBob in half]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I've got an idea! [Cut to outside the Krusty Krab, where a marching band plays, and a crowd gathers around Mr. Krabs] ...And so ladies and gentlemen, be sure to buy plenty of Krabby Patties as I bury myself alive! [Everyone cheers and confetti shoots up from the ground as Mr. Krabs wields a shovel. He digs a hole, and then hops into it] No free refills. [scene cuts. Then, he pats the dirt in around him, leaving himself underground with no trace of him. Fred runs up to on top of where Krabs was buried]
Fred: Hey, everyone, listen! [the music stops] The talking dog at the Shell Shack is SINGING!!! Come on!
[He motions for everyone to follow, and they do, leaving Mr. Krabs alone, under the ground. Cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab, where it has been cleaned out]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: What am I going to do? If I don't find an idea, I'll go out of business!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: Why can't someone give me an idea?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: [looks above] Great Neptune in Heaven, I need an idea!!!
[A divine light hits Krabs, and SpongeBob comes down, playing the harp and dressed like an angel]
Angel SpongeBob: [singing] Mr. KraaAAaaaAAAbbs! I haAave an ideeeaaaaAAaa!
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] What in the name of money are you waiting for, boy? Tell me!
SpongeBob: OK. Mr. Krabs, Prepare yourself. Don't bother sitting down, because you'll just stand up when you see this! [makes a Pretty Patty] Ta-da! [Shows Mr. Krabs a green Krabby Patty]
Mr. Krabs: Great Barrier Reef! That patty's spoiled!
[He knocks it off of the plate and onto the ground, where he burns it with a flame thrower. Once the fire is gone, SpongeBob appears in a fire-retardant suit]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Mr. Krabs, it's not tainted meat. It's painted meat [Fire once again overcomes him, and he emerges in regular clothing, with an artist's pallet in hand. On the palette, Krabby Patties lie in different colors] Pretty Patties! Available in 6 designer colors.
[short pause then Mr. Krabs laughs, and SpongeBob looks broken-heartedly at his own creation]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! Come look!
[Squidward walks up, smiling mockingly]
Mr. Krabs: [jokingly] Don't that look appetizing?
Squidward: Mmm, mmm!!! Good, sir!
[Both laughing]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Gimme an orange patty... with extra purple!
[Squidward laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What's next? [holds up a milkshake cup with sequins and encrusted into it] Sequin milkshakes?
Squidward: [holds up a French fry with a bow-tie on] Bow-tie French fries?
SpongeBob: [Welding with tears] No.
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs dance mockingly while Squidward chants "Pretty Patties! Pretty Patties!"]
SpongeBob: [Crying] Stop it! [SpongeBob becomes indignant] I know this is a good idea. I'll show you! I'll... I'll... I'll open my own restaurant! [He runs out of the Krusty Krab] You'll see!
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs look at each other, then they continue laughing. Cut to Conch Street]
SpongeBob: [angrily approaches an angry Patrick] Hey, Patrick, are you angry, too!?
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: What's the matter?
Patrick: I can't see my forehead. What's your problem?
SpongeBob: I have a good idea, and no one else thinks so.
Patrick: [no longer angry, and a cord appears from his shorts] Me too. [he pulls the cord, causing his shorts to inflate and lift into the air a few feet. Patrick is floating upside-down] Inflatable pants! What's your idea?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna open up a restaurant and sell Pretty Patties!
Patrick: [his shorts explode, leaving him with only a piece of his shorts covering his crotch] Forget my dumb idea, that's great!
[Cut to later, where SpongeBob has constructed a purple stand that says "Pretty Patties." Patrick is behind a second one to the left of SpongeBob that is brown and says "Pay Here"]
SpongeBob: Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick? [Patrick looks down and pulls up his purple-and-green trunks and gives SpongeBob the thumbs-up] Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open. [He puts up an "Open" sign. Cut to him at the stand] I'm ready! [He is an adult with the same camera angling. He has glasses on, and brown hair. His pineapple begins to rot] I'm ready. [He is an old man with a long, gray beard. His pineapple wilts and dies] I'm ready... [His gravestone behind the stand says "R.I.P. I'M READY." There is a vacant spot where his pineapple previously was. SpongeBob wakes up at the stand and sees that that was a dream] Patrick! How long have we been standing here?!?
Patrick: [looks at the sloppily-drawn crayon marks on his wrist made to look like a watch] Uhh... I gotta draw a new battery for this! [scribbles on his wrist with a blue crayon]
SpongeBob: What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb. [cries]
Patrick: SpongeBob, sometimes, we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems.
SpongeBob: I'm scared.
Patrick: Then I'm going in for you! [climbs into SpongeBob's head through one of his pores. Then, SpongeBob inflates like a puffer fish]
Patrick: Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants! [flies out of SpongeBob and lands headfirst on the ground]
SpongeBob: Did you find anything?
Patrick: Huh?
Harold: [walks up to the stand] Hey, do you sell food here?
[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle, making Harold feel awkward]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties! [holds out a green Pretty Patty]
Harold: That thing's green! [starts laughing hysterically] Green! [laughs some more]
Patrick: [laughs as well, but doesn't laugh hard at all] Green. [SpongeBob cries]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs was right! What am I going to do with all these? [holds out the palette of Pretty Patties]
Harold: [Stops laughing] Hey, is that one purple? Purple is my favorite color! [He tries it] This isn't half bad! Hey, world! "Pretty Patties" is the best idea ever! [SpongeBob and Patrick are elated]
[Cut to Mr. Krabs in his office, eating popcorn and watching a movie, crying. A spider dangling from its web cries as well]
Rick's Wife: [On TV] Oh, Rick, how could you? Together we were one.
Rick: [On TV] That was before. But now, I'm splitting us up.
[Onscreen, an amoeba splits into two amoebas. All of a sudden, it turns to a Bikini Bottom News emergency broadcast. Johnny talks at a desk. Behind him is a bamboo screen showing a crowd of Bikini Bottom citizens cheering]
Johnny: We interrupt this program to bring you a special news announcement! This wild crowd behind me is screaming for Bikini Bottom's latest culinary sensation. Let's take a listen.
All: [Chanting] Pretty Patties! Pretty Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Pretty Patties? [The spider comes down and steal Mr. Krabs' popcorn]
Johnny: It's easy to see Pretty Patties are popular, but what is it about them that drives Bikini Bottom feeders wild?
Millie, Sadie [has hair], and Evelyn: [we see Millie, Sadie Rechid and Evelyn on screen, who hold out their purses to compare with the Pretty Patties] They match our purses!
Scottish Man: [with Scottish accent, kilt, and bagpipe] They remind me of home. [holds up a plaid Pretty Patty and Larry runs up]
Larry: Pretty Patties rule! [flexes his muscles]
Johnny: Mr. SquarePants, how do you explain all this success?
SpongeBob: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... I don't know.
Mr. Krabs: How can you make money with such a stupid idea?
Johnny: [the TV background has money falling] And how can you not make money with such a brilliant idea?
SpongeBob: [laughs] At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it... [Mr. Krabs' eyestalks inflate] ...shredding it... [Krabs' eyestalks inflate some more] ...and burning it! [Mr. Krabs's eyestalks burst and fly around like a balloon with a hole in it as he screams] But in the end, we decided just to give it all away.
[Patrick is at this stand that now has a bamboo "$" and says "FREE MONEY." He hands a filled paper sack to Nathiel]
Patrick: Come again, sir!
Nathiel: I'm getting back in line! [runs off]
Mr. Krabs: I don't believe it! [runs out of his office and across the dining area] I've got to see this for me self! [runs out the door and into Sandals]
Sandals: Hey Watch it, buddy. I don't care how much you want your Pretty Patty. You're gonna have to wait in line [shows Krabs the very long line] like the rest of us.
Mr. Krabs: I've never had a line.
[At SpongeBob's stand, the "Now Serving" sign flips to 46,853]
SpongeBob: Who's #46,853?
[An enormous amount of people surround them and they simultaneously declare themselves as #46,853. Mr. Krabs makes his way to the front of the line]
Mr. Krabs: [surprised] I never had 46,853 customers.
SpongeBob: [hands a Pretty Patty to an anchovy] Here you are, sir. Stay pretty. [he laughs] All right. [notices Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs smiles nervously] The Pretty Patties are a big hit.
Mr. Krabs: They sure are, boy. You're doing pretty well for yourself. I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: [gets an idea, then he smiles smugly] I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs? [demonstrates rubbing two pickles together] That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... Yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab's only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down. For old time's sake. [takes SpongeBob by the hand and starts to walk away, but SpongeBob's arm expands and he just stays in the same place]
SpongeBob: Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, lad. I'll watch the stand for ye. [SpongeBob retracts his arm]
SpongeBob: You will?
Mr. Krabs: No, I've got a better idea! I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands- for keeps! An in exchange, I'll give ya the Krusty Krab! With Squidward, the grill, and all those squeaky pickles!
SpongeBob: [In a trance] What did you say, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Here's the key to the Krusty Krab. [gives SpongeBob the key, which is composed of 2 K's and a ring] She's yours now.
SpongeBob: [receives the key, while still in a trance] Thank... you... what should I do now, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Run to her, boy. She's waiting for ya.
SpongeBob: I can't feel my legs, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, boy! I'll fix it! [grabs SpongeBob and tosses him to the crowd] Get this to the Krusty Krab on the double! Good luck, lad!
SpongeBob: [while crowd-surfing, SpongeBob's surroundings turn into a pink sky with clouds] Dreams do come true! [gets thrown to the ground]
[SpongeBob floats up and kisses the building. He cheers in the dining area, kiss the floor, throw buns up into the air in the kitchen, laugh over the phone in Mr. Krabs' office, and stand at the ordering boat, the whole Krusty Krab cleaned and refreshed. Cut back to the Pretty Patties stand]
Mr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen! "Pretty Patties" is now under new management! [holds a green Pretty Patty] Who's next? [the crowd cheers]
[A sea-level shot of the Bikini Atoll Island. It turns from night to dawn and the rooster crows everyone up. Cut to Mr. Krabs at the stand beside SpongeBob's house. The "Free Money" stand has been disassembled]
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready...For me money. [the crowd gathers around him, all looking angry] Welcome to Pretty Patties. May I take your money?
Franco: [high-pitched voice] We want a refund, Krabs. [crowd yelling in agreement]
Mr. Krabs: [confused and scared as he turns his head three times] Who, huh, What?
Gus: Your dumb Pretty Patties turned my [shows his purple face] face purple!
Scottish Man: [Scottish accent] Look what I got under my kilt! [raises his kilt to reveal a plaid body, and white underwear]
Clay, John, and Frank: And look at our tongues! [they show Mr. Krabs their respective tongues: a yellow tongue, a speckled tongue, and a normal-looking pink tongue]
Mr. Krabs: [confused as he refers to Frank's tongue while sweating] What's wrong with you?
Frank: [turns off a light to reveal his tongue is glow-in-the-dark, and is pulsing green] We want our money back. All 46,853 of us. [turns the light back on, but Mr. Krabs is nowhere to be seen]
Harold: Hey, where'd he go?
[Cut to Mr. Krabs screaming and running away]
Crowd: Get him! [crowd yelling, chases Krabs, with a rainbow trailing behind them]
Mr. Krabs: [panting...]" Oof! "[slams on the Krusty Krab door but it's locked] My key! [checks his pocket for the key but it's not there] Where's my key?! [recalls he gave it to SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [he quickly bangs the door to get SpongeBob's attention] SpongeBob, let me in! [inside the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is too busy happily rubbing the two pickles together, making a squeaking sound] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [Mr. Krabs tries to get SpongeBob's attention from outside] SpongeBob! Let me in! [SpongeBob cannot hear due to his pickle-squeaking. Krabs screams as he is chased left and right by the mob, still vainly yelling for SpongeBob's attention. Crowd yelling] SpongeBob!


Sandy: [Sandy rakes a pile of leaves in the shape of Texas] There we go! SpongeBob, I got all the leaves ra... [steps on piles of leaves still on the ground] SpongeBob, what are all these leaves doing here? You said you were going to rake them!
SpongeBob: [peeks his head out of a pile of leaves he is in] I am raking the leaves.
Sandy: But they're still all over the ground!
SpongeBob: Sandy, I can't rake any faster. [picks up a leaf and starts scraping it with a tiny rake] These are big leaves. [leaf breaks into more pieces] And they keep breaking into more leaves.
Sandy: [Sandy pushes him away and rakes them herself] Then go scrape the salt lick or somethin'! We got to get this stuff done before it's too late!
SpongeBob: What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?
Sandy: [hanging laundry] I told ya, SpongeBob... [scrubs the birdbath with a toothbrush] I'm hibernating next week.
SpongeBob: Hibernating? What's that?
Sandy: [painting the fence] It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter.
SpongeBob: Can I do that?
Sandy: [chuckles] No, silly. It's a mammalian thing. [paints over SpongeBob's helmet]
SpongeBob: Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.
Sandy: [cleaning her exercise wheel] Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!
SpongeBob: Why, Sandy? When does your... "carburation" begin? [Sandy jumps down, pulling down a giant calendar with a giant x on the 8th]
Sandy: In one week!
SpongeBob: But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3... [gasps] 168 more hours of playtime!
Sandy: You're telling me. And there's still so much stuff to do! We gotta climb some things!
SpongeBob: Climb!
Sandy: We gotta jump off of stuff!
SpongeBob: Jump!
Sandy: We gotta ride!
SpongeBob: Ride!
Sandy: I don't wanna go to sleep yet!
SpongeBob: Wait, Sandy! [Sandy begins to cry]
Sandy: I can't burn carbs in my sleep!
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: What?!
SpongeBob: Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you. [Pantera playing]
Sandy: Well, I'm glad, SpongeBob, 'cause for the next seven days, it's gonna be you, me, and these sweatbands! [holds them up. Cut to the giant sand mountains area. Sandy is riding a giant clam shell smashing through a sign] Yee-ha! [sliding down the mountain so fast she is now on fire. She rides past a fish with a backpack on his back. When she goes past him, he drops to the ground and rolls around cause he is on fire. She then rides past a man and a woman. The woman now wears a jogging outfit and the man is now riding a tricycle and holding a lollipop and paddleball. The woman looks at him]
Unnamed Fish #1: Uh... I can explain. [Sandy flips in mid-air, still on fire]
Sandy: I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage! Woo-hoo! [SpongeBob is wearing his green karate head gear and riding down the mountain on his tongue. Cut to two kids, building a sandman]
Girl: Maybe, if we sing that song, he'll come to life.
Billy: Ready?
Both: [singing] Oh, there once was a sandman... [SpongeBob rides into the sandman. a musical note pops up]
SpongeBob: Life's as extreme as you want to make it! [jumps off the mountain] Whoo!
Girl: Maybe we didn't sing it right. [SpongeBob is flying toward the ground. When he hits it, two bones are sticking out]
SpongeBob: Yeahhh... [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob standing outside Sandy's treedome] Whew, what a workout. [pulls out his right arm and shows its damages] I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow. [his arm falls to the ground] Ow.
Sandy: I got to say, I'm impressed with you, SpongeBob. You're making this the best prehibernation week ever.
SpongeBob: Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again. [sighs as he lifts up his left leg and moves it alternately with the other over to his house. Later, it's nighttime and he is finally crawling into bed] Good night, Gary. [falls asleep. Then Sandy pushes a button which launches SpongeBob out of his bed and into a lake. SpongeBob is now a block of ice. Sandy jumps in and becomes a block of ice]
Sandy: Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [shivering] W-what h-happened to s-sleeping? [Sandy pulls down a calendar]
Sandy: I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun. [swims away] Well, hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour! [cut to SpongeBob lifting a bowling ball into a tube. Sandy blows her whistle giving the signal and SpongeBob runs to the end and picks up a few jacks before the bowling ball hits him on his head. Sandy does the same thing but the bowling ball cracks her helmet] Isn't this GREAT?!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I've never played extreme jacks before! [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob with giant q-tips]
Sandy: Okay, SpongeBob, this one's going to be fun! We just whack each other with these giant ear cleaners 'til one of us falls off! [lifts hers up] On your mark... get set...
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?
Sandy: Go! [hits SpongeBob off the Sea Needle. SpongeBob lands on a fire hydrant. Sandy rides up on a two-seated bike] Come on, SpongeBob, we're goin' for a tandem ride through the park!
SpongeBob: Gee, that sounds safe!...I mean, fun. [gets up but leaves a piece of himself on the fire hydrant. He jumps on the bike] Okay, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy?
Sandy: I did, SpongeBob: the industrial park! [they ride into a giant factory] This is where the real action is! [Sandy pedals on barbed wire] This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on! [they ride through a conveyor belt with a giant crunching mouth at the end] I hope we make it! [bike begins to fall to the ground fast. SpongeBob screams] I'm havin' fun, too! [as they hit the ground, SpongeBob melts into a puddle. Sandy tosses a fishing rod on him] Wake up, slowpoke! [scene scrolls over to show a plane] We're going fly-fishin'! [rimshot]
SpongeBob: [thinking] This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle! [sees his shoe floating] Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something.
Sandy: What is it?
SpongeBob: Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of... [his mouth melts away from his eyes. He pulls it back up] I just feel like maybe I need to... [his mouth melts away again. Sandy puts her hand over his mouth]
Sandy: Hold that thought, SpongeBob! 'Cause it's time for a down-home favorite! [holds up a piece of hay. Pantera plays again] Find the hay in the needle stack! [throws it in a giant pile of needles]
SpongeBob: [bites his fingers in fear. Cut to inside the needle pile] Ow-ow, ow-ow-ow! [he gets pricked by the needles. One needle pricks his nose, causing it to deflate like a balloon. Deep voice] ...OUCH.
Sandy: Did you find it?
SpongeBob: Not yet.
Sandy: Well I'm going to look over here!
SpongeBob: You do that. [SpongeBob digs a hole underground then emerges]
Sandy: Found it, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs away] Come on! Best two out of three.
SpongeBob: Gotta hide! Uh-G-Gotta hide! [looks at his house] Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret. [looks at Patrick's rock] Under a rock? It's so original! [as he jumps for the rock, his pants get stuck on a small coral bush]
Sandy: SpongeBob?! [SpongeBob struggles to get free and eventually does, but leaves his pants stuck on the plant] SpongeBob? [Sandy walks up to SpongeBob's pants] Where are you, little square dude? [gasps] SpongeBob's tie! And all his other little dressin's! But-but he always folds his clothes before running around IN THE NUUUDE! Something terrible must have happened to him! [crunching and munching] Alright, listen up, y'all! I'm rounding up a search party! SpongeBob's gone missing! [Squidward smiles at Mr. Krabs, thinking that Mr. Krabs will not look for SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs gives Squidward an angry look.]
Mr. Krabs: [Squidward frowns because they will search for SpongeBob] Man the lifeboats!
Sandy: Alpha Team, you search uptown, Gold Team searches downtown. Any questions?
Frank: Gold Team rules!
Sandy: Now get movin'! [crowd yelling. Fred put a Lost poster with a picture of SpongeBob] SpongeBob? [Cuts to Sandy and the search party] Someone look up there! [Sandy pops out of a sewer] Put your doors, and friends into it! [cut to searching in the sulfur fields] Come on! He could be anywhere in these sulfur fields! [Clay looks in a spout]
Clay: Hey, SpongeBo-ob! [a blast of sulfur hits him in the face] …Well, at least I still have my personality.
Sandy: Check in this here moist cave! [Old Man Jenkins, Nathaniel and Scooter walk in shouting for SpongeBob then run out, realizing the cave is actually a three-eyed sea elephant]
Sandy: Status report!
Small Fish: [covered in Poison Sea Urchins] He's not at the Poison Sea Urchin cove...
Sandy: Well, look again!
Vera: [covered in leeches] He's not at the leech farm!
Sandy: Well, look again!
Squidward: He's not in my thoughts.
Sandy: Well, THINK AGAIN! [cut to Sandy talking into a megaphone] Attention, Bikini Bottom, the time has come to double, no, triple our efforts!
Squidward: How about a break? We've been at it for days!
Gale: Think about the children!
Sandy: That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach.
Frank: [whispering to Sadie] This is a load of barnacles...
Sandy: I heard that! No one's going anywhere until we find SpongeBob!!
Frank: Uh... uh, wait! [picks up Francis] Uh, here he is!
Sandy: That ain't SpongeBob! SpongeBob is square!
[Frank shapes Francis into a square]
Francis:  [in a poor imitation of SpongeBob] "I'm ready, I'm ready"?
Sandy: No you ain't! [Clay holds up a box of Kelp-O]
Clay: I found SquareBob!
Sandy: That's just a cereal box. Besides, he's yellow.
Charlie: [holds up a banana] Uh... here he is! Hey, can I go home now? [Sandy becomes annoyed]
Tina: [points up] Oh, look! He's up in the sky! [Sandy happily looks up, but SpongeBob's not in the sky]
Sandy: He's not...huh? [everyone is gone] They must have gone to search some more. [Sandy continues searching for SpongeBob] SpongeBob, where are you?! [lifts up a house] You under there?! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house where the unnamed fish from before is at]
Unnamed Fish #1: Uhh, I can explain.
Sandy: [lifts up another house] SpongeBob?! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house] Nope! SPONGEBOB!!!! WHERE ARE YOU!?!?!?!
Unnamed Fish #9: [everyone is looking at Sandy] That squirrel's gone crazy.
Woman: But she'll never look under a rock.
SpongeBob: Ahahaha, you said it! Sandy'll never find us! [everyone glares at SpongeBob and throws him out] Hey, wait, you don't understand!
Squidward: [pops out from under the rock] "Oh, look! It is I, SpongeBob, out here in the open!" [Sandy turns around]
Sandy: SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: [in horror] AAAAAHHH! C'MON, LET ME BACK IN! You don't understand! [Sandy hugs SpongeBob]
Sandy: Oh, SpongeBob, I was so worried! I thought something terrible happened! [grabs his arm] Come on! There's just enough time to go atom smashing! [Sandy runs but SpongeBob is not moving]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait!
Sandy: There's no time to wait!! HIBERNATION!! [pulls on SpongeBob's arm]
SpongeBob: Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important! [Sandy lets go of SpongeBob's arm] I...am a man! [holds up a razor] Okay, Sandy, I...I...I-I-I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU ANYMORE! I JUST CAN'T TAKE THE GAMES!! THEY'RE TEARING ME APART!!! [rips off his nose and throws it on the ground, then holds onto Sandy's legs crying] There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I...
[He notices Sandy has fallen asleep]
SpongeBob: Sandy? [chuckles a little] I never thought I'd say it, but thank Neptune for hibernation! [laughs and falls asleep]
Patrick: [returning home with groceries and an ice cream] WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?!?!


[A shot of the exterior of the Krusty Krab is shown.]
TV Announcer: And now, back to Crustacean Crime Theater.
[The scene changes to show a black and white TV. On it, there is a sleeping crab. Another crab comes in and laughs evilly. He grabs the other crab's shell, and the sleeping crab wakes up. The crab, possibly the Sneaky Hermit, runs away with the shell, laughing evilly.]
Shellnapping Victim: Stop! Thief!
[Two police officers show up.]
Cop #1: Which way did he go?
Shellnapping Victim: [pointing to the direction the thief ran] He went that way!
Cop #2: Let's get 'em, boys!
[four police officers run after the Sneaky Hermit, off-screen. They run back into frame with the Sneaky Hermit tied up. The scene cuts to the Sneaky Hermit wearing prison stripes.]
Thief: [As bars come down and the scene pans out to show the TV inside of the Krusty Krab, at a table.] Curses! Foiled again!
[The scene shows Mr. Krabs at a table watching a small TV. Patrick and SpongeBob are behind him.]
Mr. Krabs: What a no-good eel-in-the-kelp that guy was! [Stands on barrel.] There ain't nothing worse than a thief! Thieves need to be locked up forever! They should all be strung up by their gills and forced to breathe air!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, what about all the stuff you stole?
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
SpongeBob:  [points to the barrel Mr. Krabs is standing on] Like that barrel. [The scene then shows a close up of the barrel.] It says, "Property of Salty Sea Farms".
[Mr. Krabs jumps off the barrel.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's where I rent me pickles from.
SpongeBob: Are you renting the barrel, too?
Mr. Krabs: Well, no.
SpongeBob: Then you bought it?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: Then, isn't that stealing?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I, uh...
Patrick: [While holding up a towel.] What about this towel from the Sizzling Spring Sauna?
Mr. Krabs: Um... Well..
SpongeBob: [While waving a phone back and forth] And this Bikini Bell phone.
Mr. Krabs: Well, uh, it's
Patrick: [While holding up hedge clippers] And Sandy's hedge clippers.

Mr. Krabs: [While grabbing the hair curlers] That one was a gift! [He stops sweating.] Listen, all that stuff is, uh... borrowed.
SpongeBob: Borrowed? Well, that's a relief. I thought you took it without [While shaking his head] permission.
Mr. Krabs: [While waving his claw down] Ah, permission shmermission! You can borrow anything you want, anytime, as long as if you give it back [puts arms to side] before it's missed. [While shrugging] Everyone knows that! Right?

Patrick: Oh, that's it. [Patrick stomps his foot down on the firewood. The fire lights up again. Patrick howls in pain, hopping around holding his foot.] First the balloon, now my candy bar. You're out of control. I'm... [menacingly] I'm telling on you!
SpongeBob:  [gasps] Not if I tell on you first!
[SpongeBob runs off-screen.]
Patrick: I'll beat you there!
[He runs off-screen. The two are shown running next to each other. The two are shown running from a worm's-eye view]

[SpongeBob and Patrick are running down the block jumping up and down, disfiguring themselves in the process]
SpongeBob: [hyperactive, in time with Patrick] Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house! Yeah! Ha-ha! Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house! Ha-ha-ha...
Patrick: [hyperactive, in time with SpongeBob] Yay! Yay! Ha-ha! I'm gonna beat you there! I'm gonna... ah, it's gonna be fun! Ah-ha...
[They freeze in mid-run when they see Sandy's treedome is enclosed with metal walls. The two walk up to the door, which has a "Keep Out" sign on it]
SpongeBob: Sandy? [they enter] Hey, Sandy, what's with the sign?
[the two walk up to a TV which shows Sandy in a pink nightgown eating acorns]
Patrick: Look, she's on the eating channel.
Sandy: [On TV. Sandy fills her cheeks with acorns and swallows, wincing in pain as the giant mass of acorns passes down her long, thin neck and into her small torso, deforming it as it goes] Howdy, [eats more nuts] if y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called HIBERNATION. ["HIBERNATION" appears on the bottom of the screen. Sandy eats more nuts] During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So, do not disturb! [sternly] ...That means you, SpongeBob.
[Patrick turns the TV off and puts on SpongeBob's water helmet and his own]
Patrick: We better put these on.
SpongeBob: Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray.
[Patrick pushes the button, letting all the water drain out of the front foyer]
Patrick: When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? "No" means "yes"!
SpongeBob: Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?
Patrick: SpongeBob! Look at this! [snow falls in and covers the bottom of the treedome. SpongeBob gasps and walks in]
SpongeBob: What is this stuff? [pan around the treedome]
Patrick: It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before!
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Wow, Patrick, that was beautiful!
Patrick: What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see? [he hands SpongeBob the wrapper. SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Put your helmet back on! [Patrick has taken his helmet off and is eating the snowflakes] You know there's no water in Sandy's house!
Patrick: It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look! [Patrick lets a flake land on his tongue and it melts into water]
SpongeBob: I guess you're right. It's okay here!
Patrick: Take it off, no one's lookin'. [SpongeBob does so and the two cheer and burrow themselves in the snow. They pop back up with noses made of snow. Then, they hear a weird sound] SpongeBob, did you hear that?
SpongeBob: I think it came from Sandy's tree.
Patrick: That is one tired tree.
SpongeBob: Let's check it out. [cut to inside Sandy's tree where SpongeBob and Patrick come in. They both gasp] Look what's in Sandy's bed! [they walk over to the bed, where Sandy is asleep in hibernation form, looking like some weird squirrel-like monster]
Patrick: Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!
SpongeBob: I think this thing is Sandy.
Patrick: Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep.
Sandy: [snoring, talking in sleep] I've had enough of your dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan. I'm gonna get you and your partner, Pinhead Larry or my name ain't Sheriff... Sandy... [snores]
SpongeBob: [giggles] She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws. [the two giggle] Look out, Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan.
Sandy: I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense.
SpongeBob: Oooh, you better run faster, Sandy!
Patrick: Yeah, I'm getting away! Faster! [Sandy moves her arms and legs]
SpongeBob: Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!
Patrick: Faster! faster! [the two giggle]
Sandy: I'll get you two. You're nothing but pure evil! Just like newspaper comics... [snores off to sleep, the two giggle again]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore.
Patrick: That's not disturbing, this is disturbing. [Patrick struggles to create a talking face that protrudes from his back] Hi there, SpongeBob, my name is PATBACK.
SpongeBob: Ha! That is really disturbing!
[the two laugh uncontrollably. Cut to Sandy, her eye shoots open. A giant shadow looms over SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick stops laughing while SpongeBob continues to laugh]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [stops laughing] Huh?
[Sandy is really mad now, she's steaming and roaring. SpongeBob and Patrick run, but Sandy has them both by the their pants and gives them an extreme wedgie. They run in mid-air anyway.]
Patrick: Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!
SpongeBob: [Crying from the pain of the wedgie.] Sandy! NO! STOP!
Sandy: I warned you, Dirty Dan. Now, you've just crossed the border into Hurtville.
SpongeBob: Sandy, it's us, your friends, SpongeBob and Patrick!
Patrick: Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!
Sandy: Gonna skin y'all and make a pair of size six...boots... [she falls asleep and drops the two. They inch away and see Sandy fall back into her bed]
Patrick: Fun's over.
SpongeBob: Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her.
Patrick: Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint. [he takes the lint out of its designated area. It somehow forms into the shape of earmuffs]
SpongeBob: All right, Pat! [he takes them and crawls over to the bed. SpongeBob puts the earmuffs on Sandy]
Sandy: I'm gonna rip your arms off and.... flapjacks? [snores]
SpongeBob: Well, that oughta work.
Patrick: [loudly] Hey, Sandy, does it work? [Sponge and Patrick look at each other and raise their eyebrows repeatedly and in symmetry]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!
Patrick: Hey, Sandy! Don't wake up! [the two giggle, SpongeBob holds a megaphone up to Sandy's head and yells into it]
SpongeBob: See ya later, Sheriff Sandy! [laughs, the two run down to the snowy plains and act like outlaws, with that drawling voice] You're under arrest!
Patrick: You'll never catch me! [he giggles and makes a snowball and throws it at SpongeBob's face. They both laugh. Patrick starts to make another one, but he's hit by a giant mound of snow. SpongeBob stands on a giant snow cannon, laughing] Hey, that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons.
SpongeBob: They couldn't afford station wagons either! [A giant snowball shaped like a station wagon lands on Patrick]
Patrick: Nice paneling.
SpongeBob: All right, Pinhead. Your time is up! [cut to Patrick, who looks like a cone-head]
Patrick: Hey, who you callin' Pinhead? I wanna be Dirty Dan!
SpongeBob: What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?
Patrick: I'm dirty. [he's hit on the head by a giant "snow" shovel that SpongeBob has]
SpongeBob: I'd say I'm Dirty Dan. [Patrick runs off and returns with a giant bat with a nail in it made of snow]
Patrick: I'd say I'm Dirty Dan! [whacks SpongeBob with it]
SpongeBob: Ow! [whacks Patrick again] I'd say I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! Oof!
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! D'oh!
[Inside the tree, Sandy blissfully sleeps until the repeated impacts cause the earmuffs to fall off.]
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!
SpongeBob: [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! Ow! [Sandy's eyes snap open] [Cut back to outside]
Patrick: [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. [SpongeBob sees something behind Patrick]
SpongeBob: [in terror] AAAAAAAHHH!
Patrick: Screaming will get you nowh- [Sandy reaches out, grabs the top of Patrick's head and rips it off. Sandy huffs and growls as she stands behind Patrick, towering over him with sharpened teeth bared in a snarl]
Sandy: [breathing heavily] Which one of you fellers is the REAL Dirty Dan?
Patrick: Uh...I am? [bad idea, as Sandy promptly backhands him and sends him flying across the treedome]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick slams against the dome hard enough to leave a dent and little drumsticks float around his head]
Patrick: Hot wings! [cut back to Sandy, who rounds on a cowering and terrified SpongeBob]
Sandy: Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours! [SpongeBob's pupils shrink in fear, he screams and jumps away to avoid it seconds before Sandy's fist obliterates where he was just sitting. Sandy throws her head back and bellows] PINHEEEEAAAADDDD!!!! [SpongeBob whimpers and runs, Sandy is close behind. SpongeBob later doesn't seem to be going far because he's right behind Sandy on the exercise wheel. He slips and gets flung across the wheel. He flies off and slams into the picnic table, leaving a giant crater in its place. Sandy leans over the crater] Now you're gonna pay for those crimes, Pinhead! [SpongeBob picks up a wood board]
SpongeBob: Sandy, stand back. I'm warning ya! [Sandy roars right in SpongeBob's face] Okay, I warned ya! [SpongeBob throws the wooden board, Patrick pops up beside Sandy]
Patrick: Did you win? [he's hit by the board and rolls down the crater to SpongeBob’s feet] Hi, SpongeBob! [Sandy growls before leaping into the crater. SpongeBob and Patrick cling onto each other in fear for their lives as a huge shadow covers them before a cloud obscures them, presumably simulating a fight. Cut to the treedome at night where two gravestones are in front of Sandy's Treedome: one for Dirty Dan and one for Pinhead Larry. Patrick and SpongeBob come up from under the snow in respective tombstone order] Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just wanna be Patrick.
SpongeBob: Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again! [the two run to the door and SpongeBob tries to open it, but his hands slip off the wheel and accidentally hits Patrick in the face]
Patrick: Ouch! [covers his eyes in pain]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!
Patrick: Let me have a try. [he goes up to the door and spits on both hands, preparing to open the door] *Ptuh* *Ptuh* Open sesame! [nothing happens, Patrick shrugs] Well, I've done all I can do...
SpongeBob: Then we're stuck in here...until the door thaws...in spring.
Patrick: Barnacles. [cut to much later, where SpongeBob and Patrick are completely buried in the snow, shivering and blue] Is it spring yet?
SpongeBob: N-n-n-no. [Patrick and SpongeBob's snow covering on their faces breaks off]
Patrick: I'm so c-cold that I'm sh-shivering. [a piece of Patrick's side of his head cracks off, revealing his brain.]
SpongeBob: I'm so cold... [SpongeBob snaps off his two nose drippings and clicks them together] that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks.
Patrick: I'm so c-cold... that... I'm shivering.
SpongeBob: Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree! [SpongeBob begins to pull a strip of bark off the tree, but he is stopped by Sandy's booming voice]
Sandy: [off-screen] You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead! [SpongeBob quickly puts the strip back on and puts duct tape on it, whimpers. SpongeBob goes back to Patrick]
SpongeBob: The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?
Patrick: Maybe she just ignores it.
SpongeBob: Maybe...
Patrick: Maybe...
SpongeBob: Maybe it's her fur! [cut to a shot of a real-life squirrel]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah! [cut to inside the tree where SpongeBob and Patrick marvel at Sandy's fur]
SpongeBob: Look at all that warm, toasty fur.
Patrick: It's like a gold mine, but with fur. [SpongeBob slowly prepares to pluck a hair off Sandy]
SpongeBob: Carefully...carefully? [Patrick smacks him]
Patrick: Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!
SpongeBob: All right, all right, hang on a second! [he plucks one hair off and Sandy jumps up from her sleep and roars ferociously. Then goes back to sleep] That should be enough, right? [Patrick takes the hair]
Patrick: Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, big man!
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I've lived a full life! [he plucks one more hair, causing the same reaction with Sandy]
Patrick: This is taking too long! I want the warm now! [he takes a piece of duct tape, places it on Sandy]
SpongeBob: Pat, no! [Patrick rips a patch of Sandy's fur off with the tape, leaving a patch of bare skin. Sandy roars and goes back to sleep, SpongeBob sighs in relief] Pat, are you crazy?! [we see that Patrick has placed the fur on his forehead]
Patrick: No, I'm warm.
SpongeBob: Let me see that roll of tape.
[As we pan out from the tree, we hear the tape ripping out Sandy's fur and her roaring. Cut to later, Patrick comes out of the tree with a strip of hair on his forehead and his pants full of fur. SpongeBob comes out with big eyebrows and a goatee.]
Patrick: Man, that fur really hits the spot. No more frozen armpits! [he lifts his arm up, revealing fur under it]
SpongeBob: And this eyebrow-goatee-combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.
Patrick: You said it!
SpongeBob: I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!
SpongeBob and Patrick: BRING IT ON!!!
[Just then, all the snow stops and melts. It's springtime again, flowers bloom.]
SpongeBob: ...Spring?
Sandy: [off screen. yawns] Wow, spring already!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run frantically to the door, but the handle hasn't thawed yet]
SpongeBob: Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!
Sandy: [off-screen] I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!
[SpongeBob and Patrick frantically blow on the door handle until it melts. Sandy peeks out the window]
Sandy: Oh, look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!
[With that, SpongeBob and Patrick go crazy trying to open the door. Patrick screams. Sandy walks over, completely hairless and in her bikini.]
Sandy: Hey, guys! [They climb off the door]
[She sees all the different fur assortments the two are wearing. She looks down at her bald pink body and shrieks in horror.]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Sandy. [Patrick removes the furry piece from his forehead, smiling fearfully] Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals! [Sandy is really ticked now]
Sandy: [growling with fury] SpongeBob... Patrick...
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered.
[He giggles nervously. Cut to Sandy's arm pouring some lemonade, she giggles.]
Sandy: [giggles] More lemonade, boys? [pan out to see that Patrick is curled around Sandy's head and SpongeBob around Sandy's body with miserable looks on their faces, in order to cover up her bald pink hide and keep her warm until her fur grows back. The two take a glass]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Thanks, Sandy.
Sandy: Spring sure is lovely.


[It's another great day in Bikini Bottom. Gary is out in a clearing and SpongeBob tiptoes over to a rock behind him giggling. He looks from behind it]
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got ya now, Gary.
Gary: Meow? [SpongeBob jumps up and lands in mid-air. He touches Gary's shell with his index finger]
SpongeBob: Tag, you're it! [he runs off, SpongeBob jumps and he opens his mouth. He flies to his house and chomps down on the side of it, leaving him clinging. garbled] Gary will never find me here! [Gary crawls over the ground, up the house and toward SpongeBob] Uh-oh. [Gary's eye substitutes as an arm as he tags SpongeBob and meows] Tag! Now I'm it! [he laughs uncontrollably as he slides down the wall, scraping off two slices of the covering with his teeth. Patrick is below and SpongeBob takes the shavings out of his teeth]
Patrick: Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Gary and I are playing tag. You wanna join us?
Patrick: Oh boy, would I!
SpongeBob: [slyly] Okay, [touches him] Tag, you're it! [walks away]
Patrick: I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it! [Gary is still there, and he meows. Patrick tags him] Tag, you're it! I win, I win! [Gary purrs and rubs against Patrick. Then he crawls all around Patrick's body. SpongeBob walks over] What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat! [laughs]
SpongeBob: That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!
Patrick: [laughs] It tickles! [the two laugh endlessly as Gary continues to crawl around. They continue laughing and laughing until it's dark]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gare-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary. [he pulls Gary off of Patrick and walks away] Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay. [Patrick waves] What about you, Gary? [SpongeBob sees that he's no longer holding Gary] Gary? Gary? [cut to Patrick's house where the rock is up and Patrick's brushing his teeth and looking in a mirror on the side of the wall. He has his nightcap on]
Patrick: [singing] Brush brush brush, brush brush brush… [SpongeBob walks over]
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?
Patrick: [singing] Brush brush brush, [he brushes under his armpit] Brushin' everywhere… [he spits and turns around. We see Gary attached to his stomach] Nope. [looks down] Oh, hey, here he is! [Gary purrs and meows]
SpongeBob: Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep.
Patrick: Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?
SpongeBob: Hey, that's a great idea!
Patrick: A sleep-over! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games… [SpongeBob thinks to himself and we hear Patrick in the background saying, "Blah blah blah blah…"]
SpongeBob: Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover.
Patrick: And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books…
SpongeBob: OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow. [they wave good-bye and SpongeBob walks home]
Patrick: Blah blah blah blah blah… [soon, night becomes day and SpongeBob wakes up to his foghorn alarm clock]
SpongeBob: I'm awake!
Patrick: [off-screen] Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob leaps up and runs to the window. Patrick and Gary are outside]
SpongeBob: Hey, guys, how was the sleepover?
Patrick: Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows! [he pulls Gary off his chest and runs. Gary goes after him as he runs around SpongeBob's house. He runs on top of his house and falls off and continues running, which Gary then imitates] See? [SpongeBob jumps from the window and runs off]
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee! [laughs] Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me? [he notices he's not being chased] You're not chasing me… [Gary is still with Patrick]
Patrick: Come on, Gary, let's play a different game. [he and Gary walk away. SpongeBob jumps in front of Gary]
SpongeBob: Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of… [Gary crawls away after Patrick] …you… What's wrong with me? [he sniffs his armpit] Do I offend? [Patrick is playing with Gary, Gary is crawling on Patrick's toes. Patrick's on his back and laughing while Gary purrs. SpongeBob runs inside the house and brings out a ball covered in snail slime] Hey, Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball! [Gary is sitting on Patrick's bum and Patrick shakes it, laughing. SpongeBob drops the ball. Gary is now crawling up to Patrick's armpit. SpongeBob pulls a can of snail nip] Hey, Gary, look! Snail-nip! [he eats some] Huh? Huh-huh? [Gary is too busy crawling on Patrick's head to notice. SpongeBob decides to try something else, he runs inside and hangs from the window by his head] Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh, merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head! [Gary is on his shell rolling Patrick left and right] All right, that's it! [The window opens and SpongeBob falls. Gary is now rolling on Patrick's belly. SpongeBob walks up to them] Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now. [Gary's eyes lower] Gary the Snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me this instant! [SpongeBob struggles and pulls Gary off Patrick] Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary. [he walks off, Gary lets out a meow of sadness]
Patrick: Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!
SpongeBob: What's that supposed to mean?
Patrick: I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. Now, I suggest that you put him down and let him choose. [SpongeBob does so]
SpongeBob: Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him. Okay, Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary! [Gary turns around to Patrick] Uh, wrong way, Gary. [Ignoring, Gary is crawling toward Patrick] G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary! [he collapses as Gary crawls up to Patrick]
Patrick: Well, well, well… I guess that answers that question. [SpongeBob's eyes well up] So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do.
SpongeBob: [angrily, to Gary] Okay, fine, if that's how you want to thank me… [whimpers] ...for all that I've done?! [Patrick's rock falls down into place. Cut to SpongeBob's darkened room where SpongeBob is on his bed looking down at Gary's bowl. He sheds a tear into it] I guess you're not coming back, Gary. [angrily] I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend! [cut to Patrick running around laughing with Gary on his head. SpongeBob walks by with a giant worm by the leash. The worm is bluish green and is panting heavily] Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex! [Rex barks, SpongeBob pats him] Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks, too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit! [he waits, but Rex is just sitting there] Roll over, Rex, roll over! [Rex just sits there again] Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? [Patrick laughs and dances with Gary on his head] I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me. [loudly so Gary can hear] So loyal, so trusting, always by my side! [Rex barks and we see he's waiting for the bus across the street with a hitch-hiking hole with stuff in it. The bus comes and he rides off. Cut to SpongeBob entering the house with a pet carrying case] Who needs worms anyway? [SpongeBob puts down the case and opens the door] Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy. [a snail comes out. It's got big bushy black eyebrows and a tan shell, with the same design as Gary's] You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone whose name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary.
Lary: [in a deeper voice than Gary's] Meow. [Cut to Lary sitting at a table as SpongeBob walks over with a plate with a cover on it. SpongeBob is in chef garb]
SpongeBob: And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time! Ta-da. [he takes off the cover, it's snail food in Gary's bowl. But the Gary inscription now has an L written over the G] Bon appetite, Lary. [giggles. Lary sniffs it and hisses. SpongeBob quickly takes the bowl away, scared] Okay, maybe later. [walks backward. Cut to SpongeBob with his robe on, showing Lary the newspaper bed next to his own] This is where you sleep, Lary. [Lary goes over on it, hisses, and tears it up. Lary is now up on SpongeBob's bed] Uh, that's where I… [Lary hisses loudly and falls asleep instantly] I guess you can sleep there… [SpongeBob lays down on the shredded newspaper] I'll sleep down here. [lays some shreds on him like a blanket] Well, good night, Lary. [Lary hisses again. Cut to morning where Lary is watching TV. SpongeBob jumps in upside down and surprises him, causing him to hide in his shell] Hey, Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one! [clears throat] What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor! [laughs, Lary hisses and crawls away] Don't you get it, Lary? A snailor. [he deflates then he stands up] Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry. [he holds a real-life snail from his pocket. He looks at a photo of Gary] Oh, Gary, why did you have to go?! [cries] Why, Gary?! Why…?! Why, why, why, why, why, why?! [we hear Gary meow] Gary? [we see Patrick and Gary are behind him. Patrick is holding a basket of laundry]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Patrick.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Hello, Gary.
Patrick: Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?
SpongeBob: Laundry? But… we used to do laundry…
Patrick: And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?
SpongeBob: Soap? But… we used to use soap. [holds up two bottles] Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'… [tears up]
Patrick: Here it comes…
SpongeBob: Du… du… duuuuu… [cries] ttyyyyy! [his tears make both of the bottles bubble up] Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you! [stops crying] I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want. [runs up to the sofa and tears it up furiously] If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up! [runs up to the litter box] And the litter box? Forget about it! [he dumps the litter on his head] The world is your litter box! [he runs to the fridge and opens it] And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access! [he takes a milk carton and drinks it] And you don't even have to use a bowl! [he runs to a giant carving of Squidward] And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward. [scratches at it] Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary? [we see SpongeBob has carved Squidward into a heart]
Patrick: How pathetic…
SpongeBob: Gary…? [the heart breaks in half and one half hits him. The two walk to the laundry room]
Patrick: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it, SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself. [he takes off his shorts and puts them in the machine; Gary crawls in after them] It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary? [the two notice Gary is in the machine, nudging in Patrick's shorts] He only liked me for my shorts!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket! [Gary is indeed eating the cookie. He finishes and crawls out up to SpongeBob]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: G-G-Gary? [Gary burps and happily meows] Whee! [he hugs Gary] Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww… [giggles, he takes his leash] Let's go for a walk, pal! [the two walk out.]
Patrick: Gary? I thought what we had was special...!

  
 [It's another day at Mrs. Puff's Boating School as SpongeBob skids along his way to failing his driving test again]
 French Narrator: Here we are again at the Bikini Bottom Boating School. Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year, [cut to a shot of SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff's car coming straight to the camera] ...and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means another [starts going into a screaming tone] whole yeAR OF BOATING SCHOOL!! [Shows a static scene as SpongeBob crashes into the camera and glass breaks. Back on regular view, the cameraman is seen to have fallen over. The French Narrator groans.]
 SpongeBob: ...whahappened?
 Mrs. Puff: Oh, nothing SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian. [writes on clipboard] Minus 20 more points.
 SpongeBob: How many does that leave me with?
 Mrs. Puff: Negative 224.
 SpongeBob: How many more minutes left in the test?
 Mrs. Puff: The test is over.
 SpongeBob: That's enough time, I can make up those points! [Sponge is about to pull into reverse]
 Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me! [the boat rams into reverse and Mrs. Puff screams.] It's too late, SpongeBob! [Mrs. Puff pleads Sponge to stop as Sponge knocks over a whole row of cones, knocks through a brick wall and crashes in front of the school's main building. The dust clears]
 SpongeBob: OK, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?
 Mrs. Puff: 6.
 SpongeBob: Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?
 Mrs. Puff: Six.
 SpongeBob: [raising arms slowly] Whooooooooooooo...
 Mrs. Puff: Hundred. [SpongeBob stops]
 SpongeBob: What?
 Mrs. Puff: 600. You need 600 to pass. You got 6.
 SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll be all right Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year! [he slams his fist down, which causes a piece of the motor to fly upward] Well, see you next Tuesday! [Sponge walks off and the piece crashes on Mrs. Puff. She inflates like she always does when Sponge crashes. SpongeBob runs out to his unicycle-like bike] Yeah! [singing] I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year. [goes around in circles on his bike] One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! [Mrs. Puff looks on, still inflated]
 Mrs. Puff: [thinking] Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole! [starts to talk, when she does, she deflates to her normal size] Extra crediiiiit!
 SpongeBob: What was that, Mrs. Puff? [Mrs. Puff runs over and shakes him in joy]
 Mrs. Puff: Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit! [laughing wildly] I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.
 SpongeBob: What's extra credit?
 Mrs. Puff: It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.
 SpongeBob: [singing] Oh….. [cut to Sponge at his desk]
 Mrs. Puff: Now, are we ready for that extra credit?
 SpongeBob: Extra credit!
 Mrs. Puff: That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a 10-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.
 SpongeBob: But I've learned so many things.
 Mrs. Puff: Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started. [SpongeBob writes what she says] "What I learned in boating school is…" There! That's already 7 words! Only 3 more!
 SpongeBob: [writing] L… e… a… r… [pencil snaps] Oh, barnacles.
 Mrs. Puff: What's wrong?
 SpongeBob: Got to sharpen my pencil. [Sponge whistles as he walks to the sharpener. He then sharpens it multiple times to get just the right sharpness. Mrs. Puff begins to sweat. Sponge is finally satisfied and walks back to his desk] N… e… [pencil breaks again, he walks to the sharpener again, Mrs. Puff stops him, grabs the pencil and holds out a pen]
 Mrs. Puff: Give me that! Here's a pen.
 SpongeBob: A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils. [walks back to desk singing] Gonna write an essay, that's what I say. [SpongeBob finishes] There.
 Mrs. Puff: Fantastic, let me see it.
 SpongeBob: No, wait! I changed my mind! [erases some stuff out]
 Mrs. Puff: I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see. [Sponge jumps on top of his paper]
 SpongeBob: Don't look! It's not ready.
 Mrs. Puff: It's so simple, only 10 words! "What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity, [her eyes grow bulging veins] Blank!"
 SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!
 Mrs. Puff: "What I learned in boating school is…!" "What I learned in boating school is…!"
 SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this! [starts to pant] Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here? [screams] My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop! [Mrs. Puff jumps on Sponge and forces the pen to push on the paper]
 Mrs. Puff: You only need 3… more… words! [the desk finally collapses and breaks. Mrs. Puff reaches for the essay] OK, let me see what you've written. [SpongeBob grabs on]
 SpongeBob: It's not ready yet.
 Mrs. Puff: It's OK, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.
 SpongeBob: No!
 Mrs. Puff: Give it to me! [the 2 pull on it]
 SpongeBob: No!
 Mrs. Puff: Let me see it! [the page rips in half. Mrs. Puff grabs Sponge's piece and attempts to read it] "What I learned in boating school is…" Uh… [on the page, it says 'What I learned in boating school is how to drive.' 'School,' 'how' and 'drive are crossed out and below are pictures of a boat, Sponge and a jellyfish] Well, the rest doesn't matter! [throws the 2 pieces on the floor] You pass! [laughs] You pass!
 SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.
 Mrs. Puff: That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.
 SpongeBob: Really?
 Mrs. Puff: Besides, here's your license. [gives it to SpongeBob]
 SpongeBob: My license! [licks it] It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-
 Mrs. Puff: [dragging him out the door] Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!
 SpongeBob: Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants! [echoes] SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants! [fades to a vision of Mrs. Puff's fears] La La La La! [he hits many pedestrians] La La La La! [he crashes through Harold and Frank]
 Fish: [crushed by the bus when SpongeBob hits it] Ow!
 [A small birthday party is going on]
 Partygoers: Harris, happy birthday! [SpongeBob runs over them] My leg!
 News Reporter: So much destruction...this reporter asks, "Why?" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who- [SpongeBob runs him over] OOF!
 SpongeBob: La la la la!
 Reporter: Let's- not- use that take. [Fades to reality]
 Mrs. Puff: That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive. [Later that night while walking home] Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.
 [she opens the door and turns on the light to see the SquarePants Family standing in the center of her living room with a huge round cake in the middle saying, "Thank You, Mrs. Puff! "]
 The SquarePants': Surprise!
 SpongeBob: To the greatest teacher ever!
 Mr. SquarePants: Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family. [kisses her hand for a long while]
 Mrs. SquarePants: I think you made your point, Dear.
 Mr. SquarePants: Ahem. [blushes, and walks back to the family] Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!
 Mrs. Puff: Well, I...Okay.
 Mrs. SquarePants: We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...
 Mrs. Puff: See what?
 Mr. SquarePants: Ta-da. [reading back license plate: "IM-RDY"]
 Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob: A brand new boatmobile?!
 SpongeBob: For me...? [faints and hits the cake, cutting out a perfect square. The family is in the car ready to drive away with SpongeBob still passed out in the backseat]
 Mrs. SquarePants: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff...he'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!
 Mrs. Puff: What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name...! No. Not again! I've got to end this before it begins.
 [In SpongeBob's bedroom, he's laying in bed with his parents overlooking him]
 Mr. SquarePants: You took quite a buster there, son.
 SpongeBob: What I learned in Boating School today is!
 Mr. SquarePants: We're gonna hafta hold off on the driving there for a while, son.
 Mrs. SquarePants: That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat!
 [SpongeBob peeks out to see if it's all clear, then slides through the window and floats to his new boat]
 SpongeBob: Hi, Boaty. [he runs his hand on the side of the boat and gasps] Boaty, you're cold! [he stands up and lays his socks on the side of the door] Take my socks. [he jumps on the side and hugs it] Oh Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! [he kisses the throttle lever, sighs, then falls asleep. On the horizon, a shifty dark figure runs by. It's Mrs. Puff, wearing a black ski mask. She peeks over and jumps into the boat, checking to see if the coast is clear]
 Mrs. Puff: I hope I still remember how to do this. [she takes out a purple balloon and blows it up. She then forms it into a balloon animal and snickers to herself] Hehehe yeah… [she starts the boat and drives off. What she doesn't know is that she's sitting on an asleep SpongeBob. He wakes up and sees the sky moving]
 SpongeBob: Hey, I'm driving! [the two notice each other]
 SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff: Aaaaahhhhhh!

[Mrs. Puff skids off the road for a bit, then returns to normal]

 SpongeBob: [jumps up] Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SKIING! [gasp] Oh my gosh, I know who you are!
 Mrs. Puff: [nervous] No, you don't! You don't know who I am!
 SpongeBob: Yes I do! I know that you're...a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray. [takes it out. He sprays, but it's pointed the wrong way and it gets in his eyes and he screams] Somebody help me!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!! [Mrs. Puff kicks SpongeBob out of the boat]
 Mrs. Puff: Sorry SpongeBob, but it was for your own good. [we see SpongeBob supposedly running next to the boat, but he's actually riding his bike. Mrs. Puff speeds up faster and loses him]
 SpongeBob: Give me back my boat! [SpongeBob finally catches up to Mrs. Puff and slaps his hand on the windshield. He grabs with both hands and jumps up. Mrs. Puff skids and swerves to get him off but he's not budging] You'd better stop this boat! [Mrs. Puff slams the brake and SpongeBob falls to the ground. He's still hanging on and running] I'm not letting go. Nothing will stop me! Not even… [gasps. He sees a sign reading…] Giant clams?!?! [so, SpongeBob is dragged through a field of giant clams. He comes out with a bunch of pieces missing from him] I'm… not… letting… go! Even for… [gasps, when he sees another sign for…] CHEESE GRATERS!?! [so he skids through the cheese graters. Now he's just three yellow sponge strands with arms] If you think I'll let go for a little… [he then approaches the most dreaded sign of them all…] EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION?!?!?!?! OH, NOOO!!!! [cut back to Mrs. Puff]
 Mrs. Puff: Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes. [she turns on the radio, which bears a striking resemblance to SpongeBob. It is SpongeBob, in the shape of a radio: his eyes are knobs, mouth the speaker, and so on]
 SpongeBob as Radio: And now back to K.R.U.D. with all of your personal "you won't get away with stealing my car!" hits! [Mrs. Puff screams as SpongeBob squeezes out of the box and jumps on Mrs. Puff. They get into a giant brawl and the car goes out of control. Two cops look on]
 Cop 1: Hey, look. [the car then flies off a cliff and straight for the squad car. The two policemen scream as they are now scared out of their wits. While plummeting, SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are still brawling]
 SpongeBob: I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were… [he rips off the ski mask, revealing who the culprit is] … Mrs. Puff!?! [SpongeBob flaps his lips in disbelief in a hypnotic background as the car crashes into the police car. Seconds later, the siren goes off. Later, SpongeBob is calling Mrs. Puff on the phone. Every time a person talks, it cuts to them] So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?
 Mrs. Puff: Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to… apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.
 SpongeBob: So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?
 Mrs. Puff: I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.
 SpongeBob: You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student [cut to see that Mrs. Puff is talking to SpongeBob from jail, through that visiting window]. And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?
 Mrs. Puff: What's that? [pan out from the jail exterior]
 SpongeBob: [from inside] Free driving lessons! [laughs]

 
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join Bikini Bottom's noblest, boldest, oldest superheroes as they bravely prepare for vacation. [both pack their clothes into their bags while the words “FOLD” and “PACK” come up] But wait! While our heroes relax at Leisure Village... who will watch the Mermalair?! [Barnacle Boy opens the doors and SpongeBob and Patrick jump in]
SpongeBob: ManSponge...
Patrick: ...and BoyPatrick...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Reporting for duty!
Barnacle Boy: Yeah, yeah, follow me.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Up, up, and awayyyyyy!!
Mermaid Man: EVIL!
Barnacle Boy: Now, we want you boys to keep an eye on the place. Water the plants, and make sure that...
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh, Patrick! This is the greatest wall of superhero secret gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!
Patrick: I get the Aqua-Glove!
Mermaid Man: Hold on there, boys! You cannot play with this stuff!
SpongeBob: What about the Orb of Confusion? [turns the orb on and makes confused faces]
Mermaid Man: [turns it off] No, no! Prolonged exposure to the Orb of Confusion will give you... uh... confusion!
Patrick: [opens the boat's door] What about the Invisible Boatmobile?
Barnacle Boy: Especially not the Invisible Boatmobile! [closes the boat's door] When we say don't touch anything, we mean don't. Touch. Anything! Do you understand?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Loud and clear, trusted boy companion!
Barnacle Boy: Well, great. Here are the keys. [SpongeBob takes the key from his hand] We'll see you in a week.
Mermaid Man: [both run out the door] UP, UP, AND AWAYYYYYY!
SpongeBob: Come, BoyPatrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay! [both flip into the other room while letting out battle cries]
Patrick: Huh? MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA...
SpongeBob: What is it, trusted sidekick?
Patrick: MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA!
SpongeBob and Patrick: MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! Man Ray! Aaaaaaaahhh! [both hide]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?
SpongeBob: Looks like he's frozen or something.
Patrick: FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO!
SpongeBob: It appears to be some sort of prison chamber... [licks the chamber] ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible! Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him! [Patrick pulls the lever down to UNFREEZE] Pat, what are you doing!?! We're not supposed to touch anything!
Patrick: But you said you had a question.
SpongeBob: We could get in trouble!
Patrick: Well, that's not a question. [they both argue when Man Ray's eyes start to light up]
SpongeBob: They said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! [pulls level up back to FREEZE]
Man Ray: I'm free! Hahaha!
SpongeBob: Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.
Man Ray: By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once!
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that.
Man Ray: Why... NOT?!
SpongeBob: Because you're evil!
Man Ray: You mean, if I was good, then you'd let me go?
SpongeBob: Yeah, sure, why not?
Man Ray: Then, uhhh, in that case... I am good.
SpongeBob: Really?
Man Ray: Yes, really.
SpongeBob: Really, really?
Man Ray: Yes. Yes. Really, really.
SpongeBob: Really Really Really???
Man Ray: YES, YES, ALREADY! I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD! NOW, LET ME OUT OF HERE OR YOU'LL SUFFER DIRE CONSEQUENCES!!
SpongeBob: Well, that's good enough for me. [SpongeBob pulls the lever back to "UNFREEZE" Man Ray is unfrozen and falls to the ground]
Man Ray: You fools! Prepare to be eradicated! [tries to jump at SpongeBob and Patrick but stops in mid-air and falls to the ground then laughs] What's wrong with me? Hahaha! What is this, HAHA HEH HEH HA, infernal contraption!?
SpongeBob: Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode 17!
Narrator: [showing a picture of the belt] As seen in episode 17!
Patrick: Oh, I love that episode.
SpongeBob: Oh, me too, me too!
Man Ray: I'll never get out of here wearing this belt! [chuckles] I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me. [chuckles again] Time for those acting lessons to pay off.
SpongeBob: Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
Man Ray: Oh, boohoo! Oh, sob! Oh, cry! [opens and closes his eyes] Oh, woe is me! You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
SpongeBob: We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go!
Man Ray: [turns around] Ahh, that would be fantastic! [chuckles] I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready for your first day at goodness school? [Man Ray puts an apple on his desk] Pat, get your wallet out. [Patrick gets his wallet out of his pocket] Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet. [Patrick tosses it on the ground] Now, what do you do?
Man Ray: Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet.
Patrick: Doesn't look familiar to me.
Man Ray: What? I just saw you drop it. Here.
Patrick: Nope, it's not mine.
Man Ray: It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.
Patrick: Return what to who?
Man Ray: [facepalms, then shows Patrick his ID] ...Aren't you Patrick Star?
Patrick: Yup.
Man Ray: And this is your ID.
Patrick: Yup.
Man Ray: I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet.
Patrick: That makes sense to me.
Man Ray: Then take it.
Patrick: It's not my wallet.
Man Ray: [in anger and frustration] You dim ball! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off! [SpongeBob pushes tickle button and Man Ray laughs]
SpongeBob: Ah-ah! Wrong. [SpongeBob pushes button] Good people don't rip other people's arms off! [Man Ray chuckles] Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?
Man Ray: Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help with... [Patrick drops package on Man Ray's foot] Ow!
Patrick: Oops, sorry. Can I start over?
Man Ray: I noticed you was... [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
Patrick: Oops! Gotta start again.
Man Ray: Would, [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
Patrick: Oops!
Man Ray: [Growls in anger] You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?!
Patrick: My wallets.
Man Ray: [Screams in fury. He grabs Patrick's head]
Patrick: No! SpongeBob, tickle him! [Man Ray slams Patrick into the ground. SpongeBob presses the tickle button]
Man Ray: [laughs] It tickles, but it's worth it! [continues slamming Patrick into the ground, while still laughing]
SpongeBob: Alright, goodness lesson number three. [Patrick is shown angry and severely injured] Uhh, let's see. [Patrick grabs the remote]
Patrick: I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?
Man Ray: Umm... 62?
Patrick: Wrong! [pushes button]
Man Ray: Haha! Stop!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.
Patrick: Let go of it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad!
Patrick: Let go!
SpongeBob: No, you let go!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Let... GO! [remote breaks and the belt goes hay-wire]
Man Ray: Frequency rising. Belt out of control. Hahahaha. Belt on too hard. [he continues to laugh] It's tickling my DNA. Make it stop! [tears come out as he laughs] Haha. Please!!
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.
Patrick: Peanuts?
SpongeBob: No. Please.
Patrick: Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.
SpongeBob: Rehabilitated.
Patrick: Gesundheit.
SpongeBob: It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future. [unlocks the belt, then the tickling stops] Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness. [Man Ray takes the Aqua-Glove off the wall of weapons] Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff. [Man Ray put the glove on his hand and activates it] We're not supposed to touch that, either. [Man Ray grabs the Cosmic-Ray and attaches it on the Aqua-Glove] We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. [He aims the weapon at SpongeBob and Patrick] Good people have no use for weapons such as... [Man Ray zaps them into dust] thoooooooooose!
Man Ray: [laughs] The only thing I'm good at is being evil. [door opens and Man Ray runs] So long, suckers!
Patrick: What's that smell, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.
Patrick: Good, I thought it was my skin.
SpongeBob: Forget about your skin, Patrick! Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him! This is a job for Mermaid Man...
Patrick: ...and Barnacle Boy! [both slide down the poles and get their costumes on]
SpongeBob: To the Invisible Boatmobile! [both stop in the invisible boat]
Patrick: Ignition, on!
SpongeBob: Wait! I don't have a license!
Patrick: Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. [shapes hand into a rectangle]
SpongeBob: You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy. [they scream as the boat rams through the wall and into a street light]
Patrick: Thank goodness for invisible seat belts!
Man Ray: Out of my way, fools! You no longer have control of me. And now this town belongs to Man Ray!
SpongeBob: Not so fast, arch-villain! We still have the Orb of Confusion! [Patrick takes out the Orb of Confusion] Take this! [turns it on and gets all confused] Doy... Duh...
Man Ray: Well, that was easy. [heads to the bank where he kicks in the door] Hahaha! All right, people! Everybody stand right where you are!
[citizens gasp]
Man Ray: I want you to, uh... [Man Ray chuckles, so everyone else chuckles, too] No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to... [chuckles again, so everyone else is still chuckling] STOP LAUGHING, YOU FOOLS!
Bank Lady: What can I do for you, sir?
Man Ray: I'll tell you what you can do! [points glove at the lady] Gimme all of your... [Man Ray chuckles again] G-gimme, gimme all of your... [Man Ray is still chuckling] Give me...! [he chuckles so much he realizes what's going on] Aah! The belt is gone, but I still feel its tickle! The urge to do bad is gone! [sighs] I guess I'll just open a checking account. [Man Ray returns to SpongeBob and Patrick and turns the Orb of Confusion off]
SpongeBob: Doy... [gasps] Man Ray!
Man Ray: No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them! [Man Ray takes his head off and gives it to SpongeBob] I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder. [walks off] 
SpongeBob: Bye, Man Ray! Wow, we did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We saved the day! Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: Uhh... [still has a confused look on his face]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Woo-hoo? Patrick?


[Lights are circling outside the Krusty Krab. Inside, there is a sign hanging from the ceiling that says 'Komedy Krab'.]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, everybody settle down. Welcome [pauses] to the Komedy Krab! [Puts an arrow on his eyes. Everyone laughs] Now please give a warm welcome to our first comic, the indiscernible Dougie Williams! [Dougie walks onto the stage as Mr. Krabs walks out]
Dougie Williams: Good evening, folks. I'm going to skip the jokes and get right to the part where I throw pies at you! [Pulls out a cart of pies. The crowd takes out their umbrellas. SpongeBob opens the curtain from behind and gets splattered with pie]
SpongeBob: [Laughs] I hope I do as good as that guy.
Dougie Williams: [Backstage] Man, those people will laugh at anything. Hey, don't sweat it kid, I got them all worked up for you.
Mr. Krabs: Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants! [SpongeBob walks out with a bow tie on]
Sandy: Go get 'em, SpongeBob!
Patrick: [Sitting at a table with Sandy] Whoo-hoo! [SpongeBob gives them a thumbs-up]
SpongeBob: Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers? I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean?
[No one laughs. A cricket is heard chirping. Cut to a live-action clip of a cricket chirping.]
SpongeBob: And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things? [Chuckles weakly. Crowd is still silent] I mean, you chop them up into slices, but... [Cut again to the cricket, who is no longer chirping.] What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup? [Chuckles weakly]
Fred: Oh, brother, THIS GUY STINKS!
Harold: HEY, HEY, FUNNY GUY! I'VE GOT A JOKE FOR YOU! WHAT SMELLS ROTTEN AND PUTS PEOPLE TO SLEEP?
SpongeBob: Umm, noxious gas?
Harold: NO! YOUR ACT! [Everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: Did you ever notice how, uhh... [Notices a fork on a table] ...forks, uhh...
Fred: Forks?! Come on! [Crowd is booing]
SpongeBob: [Thinking] Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation! [Looks around for material then notices Sandy's teeth] Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are? [Crowd chuckles]
Fish: That's true.
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things. [Crowd laughs more] And what's up with that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home, too. [Crowd laughs loud]
Patrick: [Laughing] Squirrel fur!
SpongeBob: And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt. [Crowd laughs] Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?
Fred: WHY?
SpongeBob: Because, they're so darn stupid! [Crowd laughs]
All: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Patrick: That's a good one, huh, Sandy?
Sandy: Uhh, y-yeah... [SpongeBob walks behind the curtain where Mr. Krabs is waiting for him]
Mr. Krabs: That was fantastic, boy! You really knocked 'em out! I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!
SpongeBob: I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is.
Mr. Krabs: The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show. [Hands SpongeBob a mop]
SpongeBob: Well, at least I don't have to clean up my act! [Laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy. Now get busy! [Walks off]
SpongeBob: Mops, mops, mops, what's up with those things? I mean, really. [Walks up to Sandy] Oh, hey, Sandy!
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Did you enjoy the show?
Sandy: Well, ac-actually, SpongeBob, n-no. Those jokes are hurtful and you know it.
SpongeBob: Come on, Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom.
Sandy: Well, I can't argue with that.
SpongeBob: We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time! [Holds up a mirror and laughs excessively into it. Sandy chuckles]
 Sandy: You're right, SpongeBob. I was being a little too sensitive. [Both hug] No hard feelings. [Scene cuts to Sandy at Barg'N-Mart] Okay, deodorant. Huh, let's see. Roll-on or stick? [Fred and Nancy walk by]
Fred: I think she should buy both. [Laughs]
Sandy: Huh?
Scooter: Hey, look, guys! [Seen with Lloyd and Eddy] It's the stupid squirrel!
Lloyd: I know, let's try to communicate with it.
All: Duh... [Making funny faces, then walk off laughing]
Sandy: Hmph! [Throws the deodorant into the cart, then walks up to a little kid] Hello, little critter! What's your name?
Mable: [Grabs her child] Don't stand too close to a squirrel, Billy. You'll catch its stupid. [Walks off]
Billy: Okay, mom.
Sandy: Stupidity isn't a virus. But it sure is spreading like one. [Scene cuts to the Komedy Krab where everyone is chanting for SpongeBob. SpongeBob is sitting at a desk preparing for his act]
SpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid.
Sandy: Hey, uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Sandy.
Sandy: Umm, I need to talk to you about them squirrel jokes.
SpongeBob: We already talked about that, remember? [Looks in a mirror and laughs]
Sandy: SpongeBob, this is serious. Since you've been telling them jokes, people have been treating me different. [Patrick walks backstage]
Patrick: SpongeBob, five minutes. [Notices Sandy, then talks slowly] Hel-lo... Sandy. Me Patrick. Do you un-der-stand? [Sandy looks away] Squirrels. [Walks off]
Sandy: Y-y-you see? That's what I'm talking about!
SpongeBob: Ah, that's just Patrick. He's just fooling around.
Sandy: I'm just asking you as a friend, please lay off them squirrel jokes, okay? Tell some of them other jokes you got.
SpongeBob: [Nervously] Other jokes? [Imagines the fork joke] Bah! I got a million of them.
Sandy: [Hugs SpongeBob] Thanks, SpongeBob, I knew you'd understand. [Walks to her seat. The crowd is still chanting for SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants! [Everyone cheers as SpongeBob walks out]
SpongeBob: Uhh, hi. [Chuckles nervously] Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish. [Crowd is confused] I guess you heard that one.
Sandy: I haven't heard it! Good one, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water? I mean, the stuff's everywhere.
Patrick: Tell the one about the squirrel and the light bulbs!
SpongeBob: Uhh... [takes out a big rubber chicken] Hey, what about this thing? Huh? Huh?
Fish #5: Get on with the squirrel jokes! [Crowd chants for squirrel jokes]
SpongeBob: [thinking] What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make: [Looks at Sandy] your friends... [Looks at his microphone] ...or your career.
[After a beat, he drops the microphone and everyone gasps. He walks backstage then, after a beat, jumps back on stage with hillbilly teeth]
SpongeBob: HOWDY, Y'ALLLLLLLLLL!!! [Crowd cheers loudly] How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?!
All: BECAUSE THEY'RE SO. DARN. STUPID!
SpongeBob: [Laughs as he walks around tooting a bicycle horn] My people! [Sandy gets angry] But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy. [Spotlight on Sandy as the two women around her giggle] Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes. [to audience] Am I right?! [Crowd cheers; to Sandy] Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you. Do you understand now, Sandy, huh, do ya?
Sandy: [deadpan] I understand everything that's going on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Great. I knew sooner or later you'd understand. What a great sport! [to audience] Let's give a big hand to Sandy. But clap slow, because remember, SHE'S A SQUIRREL! [Crowd is cheering their loudest] Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night! [Walks backstage] Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob. [Sees a note taped to his mirror] Oh, what's this, a fan letter? [Reads it]
Sandy: [voiceover] You were right, SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate. Sandy.
SpongeBob: You did it, SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to the Treedome with his water helmet on and flowers in his hands. He knocks on the door as the water empties from the Treedome] I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy. [Door opens] Good morning, Sandy.
[He stares on; Sandy is dressed as a hillbilly with flies floating around her]
Sandy: Well, hooOOOoowwWWWw-deeeEEEeeeEEee!
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you feeling alright?
Sandy: I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self! [Licks her teeth with her tongue. SpongeBob laughs nervously] Well, come on in! Y'all must be tired from telling them funny jokes all the time. Why don't you take a load off? [Pushes him onto a log with glue on it]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat.
Sandy: Naw, [Holds up a brush and a bucket of glue] I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off. [Gasps and grabs the flowers that SpongeBob was holding] Are them flowers for me?! You even done got me a vase! [Takes SpongeBob's water helmet off his head]
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, that, that's not a... [Sandy places the flowers in the water helmet]
Sandy: Ain't that purdy?
SpongeBob: [already dried out] SANDY, I NEED WA...
Sandy: Oh, that's right! You's a sea critter. Now what was that thing that sea critters need? Umm, uhh... let's see... [A big lump in her throat wiggles up and down] UHH, UHH, SEA CRITTERS NEED...
SpongeBob: WAAAA...
Sandy: [covers SpongeBob’s mouth] Oh, wait, don't tell me. I know this one!
SpongeBob: WAAAA...
Sandy: A Wallet? A Watch? Waffles?
SpongeBob: [hoarsely] SANDY. WATERRRR.
Sandy: Well, why didn't you just say so? [Puts the end of a hose in SpongeBob's mouth] Here you go! Yup, us squirrels sure is stupid. [Connects the other end of the hose to a pipe then turns it on. SpongeBob enlarges as more water enters into him]
SpongeBob: Sandy!
Sandy: Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb.
SpongeBob: Sandy! Okay, Sandy, I get it!
Sandy: What's that? You want more? [Connects to the end of the hose to a bigger pipe and turns it on] Okey-dokey! More water for the sea-critter! [SpongeBob is still enlarging]
SpongeBob: Okay, Sandy, okay!! I get it! [SpongeBob is filled up every inch of the Treedome] No more squirrel jokes... [Scene cuts to the Komedy Krab where the crowd is chanting for SpongeBob again. SpongeBob, who has bandages on his face, goes on stage] Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel. [winks at Sandy. cut to Patrick show his happily exciting smile, Sandy blinks with a smirk] And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of your squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb?' [Crowd laughs] But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge. [Crowd is silent] I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae. [Twists himself] Look at me! I got no bones!
Fish #6: That's true. [Crowd laughs]
SpongeBob: Crabs? Oh, brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] It's true, I am cheap!
SpongeBob: Now, let me tell you about those fish. Boy, are they smelly. Whoo-hoo, how could a creature who spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really. [Imitates a fish] "SOAP, SOAP. WHAT IS SOAP?" [Crowd laughs more. SpongeBob and Sandy give each other a thumbs-up as the scene cuts to an outside view of the Krusty Krab] And don't even get me started on starfish!


Sandy: [looking at the clouds] You know, SpongeBob, sometimes, it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by.
SpongeBob: Yup, and just relax.
Sandy: Yeah. Relax.
SpongeBob: OOOH! Ooh-ooh-ooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
Sandy: What?
SpongeBob: A flower.
Sandy: They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time.
SpongeBob: They sure do.
Sandy: You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty.
SpongeBob: Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
Sandy: Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
SpongeBob and Sandy: [both laugh] Me.
SpongeBob: That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.
Sandy: Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See? [points to her acorn patch]
SpongeBob: I thought that meant you were nuts.
Sandy: Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby. And if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength! [his fingers flex] What do you say to that, "Miss Mittens"?
Sandy: I'd say I'm already halfway there!
SpongeBob: Aaaaah! [begins to climb the mountain] No fair, Sandy! You got a head start!
Sandy: Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles! [collapses the rock SpongeBob is climbing on]
SpongeBob: Hey! [gets back on another rock] You did that on purpose!
Sandy: Yeah, but this is an accident! [unleashes more rocks at him]
SpongeBob: [screams] Aaaaahhhhhhh!!
Sandy: Too bad you forgot your umbrella!
SpongeBob: [holds on to an umbrella and floats up] ♪ I didn't! ♪ [laughing, reaches the top of the cliff]
Sandy: [sitting in a lounge chair, reading a newspaper] Well, it's about time you showed up.
SpongeBob: But you were... I saw you by the... I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
Sandy: Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter.
SpongeBob: I can underwater! I'm... [Low voice] Hydrodynamically designed! [Normal voice] Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
Sandy: Why don't you ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you say to that, HydroPants?
SpongeBob: I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there! [zooms out to reveal a record player] -halfway there!-halfway there!
Sandy: [gasps] Hey!
SpongeBob: [running at the bottom of the mountain, laughing, hits a brick wall]
Sandy: [jumps on SpongeBob's face and over the brick wall] Thanks for the face lift! [runs into the Krusty Krab, laughing] You see? I told ya you didn't have a chan-
SpongeBob: [dressed as an old man] There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature [licks lips] waiting! [rips off suit, laughing]
Sandy: I thought y'all wanted a rematch.
SpongeBob: I did! And I took a head start like you did!
Sandy: Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!
SpongeBob: I guess we don't, air breather!
Sandy: Water sucker!
SpongeBob: Tree climber!
Sandy: Gulf streamer!
SpongeBob: Kite flier!
Sandy: Chum chewer!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Take that back! You- [nervously] not wet person!
Sandy: Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!
SpongeBob: Proves what?
Sandy: That land critters are better than sea critters!
Patrick: [walks to the two] Better at what?
Sandy Cheeks: Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!
Squidward: [walks to the three] What's she blabbering about?
Patrick: She says land creatures are best.
Sandy: Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur styling and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking [Mr. Krabs joins the four] and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs all gasp]
Sandy: And name calling, for sure!
Squidward: And drowning, don't forget drowning!
SpongeBob: [laughing] Good one, Squidward! [jumps to high five Squidward, but freezes in midair] Woo!
Squidward: Not on your life, sport. [SpongeBob falls]
SpongeBob: I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel. [SpongeBob and the rest except Sandy start laughing until SpongeBob signals them to stop] But you're still just a land creature.
Sandy: Squirrels can do anything they want to!
Patrick: I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite. [gulps a big patty down] Ah.
Sandy: [reaches offscreen for the same big patty] Give me that. They don't call me cheeks for nothin'. [tries to eat it, but it splatters on her air helmet. Everyone, but Sandy and Patrick, begins to laugh]
Patrick: Thank you, thank you.
Sandy: Well, that's just one thing.
Mr. Krabs: Can you do this? [pops his eyestalks in and out of his head] Everyone in my family can do that.
Sandy: [Tries to do it] Uh...uh...
Squidward: How about this? [balances six spinning plates on a stick with his tentacles] Huh?
SpongeBob: Can you reproduce by budding? [begins to do it] Can ya? Can ya? Huh? Can ya?
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: Most importantly, can you do this!? [all except Sandy make their eyes big and round, and begin gasping three times without releasing any breath]
Sandy: Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?
SpongeBob: Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if it wasn't for that suit, you couldn't even live down here! [everyone but Sandy starts laughing]
Sandy: Well, you don't... [all continue laughing] I don't need to... [all laughing harder] Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit! [rips off suit, and all gasp] And I don't need this helmet neither! [throws helmet to ground, releasing an air bubble]
Mr. Krabs: Neptune preserve her!
Squidward: How long can she stay like that?
SpongeBob: I don't know!
Patrick: Sandy's a girl?!
SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe... [he, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs chuckle while Sandy winks] Yep, won't be long now. [she starts struggling to hold her breath] Feelin' light-headed yet?
Sandy: Mm-mm. [Sandy shakes her head]
SpongeBob: Remember this? [SpongeBob takes a deep breath in and out]
Mr. Krabs: It's free! [also takes a deep breath in and out]
Sandy: [Starts suffocating underwater. Screen shows her insides where her lungs shrivel and her left lung breaks and falls off. She suffocates, looks around, runs to the counter, and quickly digs through multiple objects, then puts her head into a pickle jar and breathes heavily. All the others start laughing] Stop laughing at me!
Mr. Krabs: I knew it! There was no way some "airhead" was gonna win anything against a water breather!
Patrick: Airhead... [laughs. The top of his head deflates like a balloon] Huh? [puts thumb in mouth and blows. His head becomes round at the top]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water!
Sandy: All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya?! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!
Squidward: Do we have to wear pickle jars? [All, except Sandy, laugh]
Sandy: Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs.
SpongeBob: One minute? No problem, Landy! [All but Sandy begin to laugh]
Sandy: [all but her are still laughing, as she leads them all to an island rising out of the water from the seafloor, as they see the island, they stop laughing] Well? So are you going or not?
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stammering] Uh, well, uh, uh, um...
SpongeBob: Actually, you know, but...
Squidward: We can't, uh...because...
Mr. Krabs: We're late for, um...
Patrick: Our fitting!
Sandy: Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes?
Patrick: [holding and eating popcorn] Hey! We are not chicken! [drops popcorn] Huh! My popcorn! [begins pecking at it like a chicken]
SpongeBob: Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it. [looks at the water's surface and pokes his finger above the water] There. Mission accomplished.
Sandy: Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!
SpongeBob: No way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!
Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: We're not afraid of your dumb old land!
Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: We're sea creatures!
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Okay... Well, this is it.
Mr. Krabs: Wait, boy, [gives him a glass of water] ...make it last.
SpongeBob: [drinks from it] Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay. [gulps hard, and starts running] Here I go! [gasps out of real water; he's now a real yellow kitchen sponge on a stick; he breathes heavily] Hey! This isn't so bad! [proceeds up to the real island] We can do this. Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!
Patrick: I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball! [jumps up out of the water. He's now a real pink starfish, missing his pants, on a stick] Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: All right, Pat, you made it!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here! [cut back to Squidward and Mr. Krabs left in the water]
Mr. Krabs: All ashore that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! [runs up] Land-ho! [he is a red rubber toy crab on a stick]
SpongeBob: Lookin' good, Mr. Krabs!
Patrick: Oh, yeah! Woohoo!
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward, you're missin' all the dry! Come on, Squidward!
SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs: [chanting] Squid-ward! Squid-ward! Squid-ward!
Squidward: [walking up] Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it.
SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs: [chanting] Squid-ward! Squid-ward! Squid-ward! Squid... [they stop chanting after Squidward walks up. He's a puppet octopus with his eyes and big, bulbous nose]
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: Well, here we are! [all four are walking on the island]
Squidward: This is pretty easy.
Patrick: I may keep a second rock up here.
Mr. Krabs: Once you get your land legs, it's not so bad!
SpongeBob: We're the masters of land and sea! [a string puppet seagull lands in front of them] Hey! It's a local. Hi! We're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks? [seagull looks towards the screen]
Sandy: 3. 2. 1. Well, tan my fur! They made it! Better go congratulate 'em. [walks onto the island. She's now a real plush squirrel toy with a small, round plastic helmet on her head] SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to? [we now see two seagulls terrorizing SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Patrick. One seagull has Patrick in it's mouth, the other is chasing around SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward. Sandy sees them and gasps.] Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! HI-YA! [she runs off camera and we hear karate noises and see feathers flying. She briefly backs into the camera's view, then runs off to fight again. All five sink back down to the seabed, with Squidward upside-down.]
SpongeBob: Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy.
Sandy: You know, everyone's best at something.
SpongeBob: But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy.
Sandy: Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!
All: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
All: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
Seagulls: [lying injured on the island with their feathers missing] Hooray.


[The episode starts at the Bikini Bottom Zoo.]
Narrator: Ah... the Bikini Bottom Zoo is having its annual Free Day. Free balloons...
[Jimmy gives Monroe a balloon but Mr. Krabs, disguised in a mustache, steals all the balloons from him.]
Narrator: Free drinks...
[Mr. Krabs comes by and fills up a huge barrel.]
Narrator: Free light bulbs?
[Mr. Krabs unscrews a light bulb from a path light and puts it into his pants just as the police arrive and become suspicious of him.]
Mr. Krabs: Aha! Top of the mornin', boys! [Laughs nervously] Whew! Next stop: gift shop.
[Mr. Krabs runs into the gift shop, then SpongeBob and Patrick walk by wearing zoo hats.]
SpongeBob: There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!
SpongeBob: [Like an announcer] He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball!
[SpongeBob crumples up his hat and spits it into the air and into a little fish's ice cream.]
Patrick: Why are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!
[The two run into the stadium]
SpongeBob and Patrick: This is the greatest day of our lives!
[Clamu is snoring and gurgling]
Patrick: This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring.
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. We came to see [Announcer voice] pearls 100 feet in the air! [normal voice] Right? I'll try my oyster call.
[SpongeBob makes a strange noise, but he gives up, because the oyster is asleep.]
Patrick: Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob.
[Patrick walks away.]
SpongeBob: Come on, come on, wake up already! [He pulls out his bag of sea peanuts. He looks left and right and then throws one at the oyster. The oyster stirs.] I think it's working!
[The oyster frantically looks around]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, it's waking up!
Patrick: Oh, boy, did I miss it?
SpongeBob: No, the show's about to begin!
[The oyster suddenly cries at the top of her lungs. SpongeBob and Patrick get blown away to the seats. The oyster hops around while bawling. Two zoo employees come running into the arena.]
Zoo Worker #1: What's wrong with Clamu?
Joe: Easy, girl! It's me, Joe! Remember?
[Clamu snarls as if it sounds like a belch and uses her tongue to throw Joe out of Oyster Stadium. Patrick and a nervous SpongeBob wait at the stands]
Patrick: Now, this is a show!
[Outside...]
Announcer: Attention, zoo patrons! Clamu, the giant oyster is on an emotional rampage! Please scream and run around in circles. [everybody runs for their lives and screams] Thanks for coming.
[In the stadium, Clamu is still smashing things and making snarling belch noises. The zoo worker goes up to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Zoo Worker #1: You boys better get out of this area, pronto! There's nothing more dangerous than an emotionally disturbed oyster. [The worker points menacingly at SpongeBob] You didn't do anything that might have caused this horrible tragedy, did you?
SpongeBob: Uh...
Patrick: No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob hides the peanut bag]
SpongeBob: Right. [SpongeBob lets out a nervous shriek]
[Clamu chomps on a piece of metal. Cut to Patrick and SpongeBob leaving the zoo]
Patrick: Man, if I ever see the guy who upset Clamu, I'd have a few choice words for him, like "you"... and... "are" ... and... "a jerk!" [SpongeBob and Patrick have now gotten to Conch Street, where their houses are] Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?
SpongeBob: I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh!
[Walks up his cobblestone path into his pineapple]
Patrick: Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!
SpongeBob: Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate! Now go home! [SpongeBob stomps into his pineapple, slamming the door behind him.] Stupid Patrick... I didn't do anything wrong! Aw, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory.
[He chuckles and turns on the TV]
Johnny: Our top story tonight: giant oyster has its feelings hurt! The only clue that could be found was this lone peanut! And as you can hear, the oyster continues to emit its horrible cry. A cry so powerful, it can be heard around the world. [TV is shown with real people covering their ears in Egypt, Holland, and India] A cry that not only breaks the sound barrier, it breaks the hearts of our citizens! [SpongeBob stares a the TV with a look of guilt and horror] What kind of cruel, careless, evil person would deliberately upset one of Neptune's most gentle creatures? [Hans uses a tissue to wipe a tear off Johnny's face. SpongeBob turns off the TV]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: [screams] No, Gary! How would I know anything about the oyster?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something? [He peers out the window at Oyster Stadium, where we still hear Clamu's wailing] This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now. Who could never hate me no matter what I do? [Cut to SpongeBob knocking on Squidward's door] Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Do you have to knock so loudly?!
SpongeBob: Sorry, neighbor.
Squidward: Oh... that overgrown clam is giving me a headache! I can't even take my afternoon beauty nap!
SpongeBob: [chuckles nervously] Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I... uh... was kind of wondering, um... Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster.
Squidward: You mean you know the guy who did it?!
SpongeBob: [gulps]
Squidward: Oh, this is great! You and I can go turn him in! And then I'll get so much sleep, I'll be gorgeous!
SpongeBob: Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically.
Squidward: You mean you don't know who did it?
SpongeBob: Well, um... I... uh... no. [Squidward slams the door in SpongeBob's face] Squidward? 
[SpongeBob walks away. On his way home, he encounters Patrick in a Sherlock Holmes outfit]
Patrick: Gotcha! [SpongeBob screams and jumps out of his pants]
Patrick: Where were you on the day of today? Don't play games with me, mister!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: Oh, hi, SpongeBob. I'm just continuing my investigation of the Great Clamu Caper!
SpongeBob: Um... have you found out anything?
Patrick: Yes! No, wait, uh... no. [Holds up sand] But this grain of sand looks pretty suspicious, [holds up a rock] and so does this rock! [Holds up magnifying glass to look at a piece of grass] And I've got a few questions for this little piece of grass! Don't worry, SpongeBob! Patrick's on the case! The truth will be revealed!
[SpongeBob runs away]
SpongeBob: I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do!
[We see Sandy and SpongeBob in the treedome, and Clamu is still shrieking]
Sandy: Oh, I can't stand it anymore! That poor, poor critter! What kind of inconsiderate person would upset such a gentle creature?
SpongeBob: Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy.
Sandy: Why, when I find out who caused that oyster so much pain, no more jiggery pokery!
[Holds up the Bikini Bottom Phone Book and rips it in half in front of SpongeBob]
Sandy: Now, what was it you wanted to talk about, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob tries to speak, but can't]
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob, how come you're all twitchy like that?
SpongeBob: Twitchy? Twitchy? Who's twitchy? I'm not twitchy! Sorry, Sandy, I have to, um... um... go get my hair cut. [He runs home]
Sandy: SpongeBob doesn't have hair... or does he?
[SpongeBob runs down the block panting. He runs to the house and tries to open the door. Patrick approaches him to talk]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is startled and he falls apart. His limbs and facial features all reattach in different places] This is it! All of the clues are coming together. I followed these footprints right to this exact spot, and then, right where you're standing, I found this bag of peanuts! Ha! Oh, I'm so close to solving this crime, I can almost taste it! [Zoom in on Patrick's mouth licking what appears to be SpongeBob's head. It is revealed to be instead licking a yellow ice cream pop that appears to be shaped like SpongeBob's head] Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow Popsicle hits the spot!
SpongeBob: Okay, uh, good luck with all that, Patrick, and, uh, I guess I'll see you later!
[He shuts the door, and inside]
Police Fish #1: Open up! This is the police!
[SpongeBob's eyes pop out of his head]
SpongeBob: Uh, uh, just a second!
[Two policefish bust in and one flashes his I.D]
Policefish #1: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
SpongeBob: Y-y-yes?
Policefish #1: Put those eyeballs back in your head, son. We've got a few questions for you.
[SpongeBob puts them in and twists them like a dial until they are positioned. Policefish #2 taps the baton on his hand while Policefish #1 talks.]
Policefish #1: Were you at the zoo on the day of the oyster incident?
SpongeBob: [stutters] Y-yes! [hides in his pants]
Policefish #1: Did you, or did you not take part in various activities of zoo-time merriment?
SpongeBob: Yes... [he sinks even lower into his pants]
Policefish #1: [holds up a peanut inside a ziploc bag with "Exhibit A" written on it] And are you familiar with... this peanut?
SpongeBob: Yes!
[His eyes peer out over the top of his pants. The bottom of his pants rip, and his body falls through.]
Policefish #1: Just one more question... Is it true that you were at the oyster's lair with a Mr. Patrick Star?
SpongeBob: [Sobbing] Yes! Yes! It's true! It's true! It's all true! The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick!
Policefish #1: That's all we need to know, son. Let's book 'im! [clink. The police put the cuffs on Patrick]
Patrick: Wow, you guys are good! I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time! It's the perfect crime!
Policefish #1: Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge, pinky!
[Police Man and Police Man 2 escort Patrick out]
SpongeBob: Oh, no! Patrick's too sensitive for the big house! [SpongeBob follows the police boat to the zoo] Wait! Stop! I'm the one you want! I am the criminal!
[crowd booing and yelling]
Sandals: [Cockney accent] Hey, everybody, let's throw peanuts at him and see how he likes it!
[The crowd is throwing the peanuts at Patrick..]
Patrick: I get what I deserve! [Crowd yelling. Patrick attempts to catch all the peanuts with his mouth.] Ouch.
SpongeBob: Wait! Hold your peanuts! Patrick Star is innocent! I have come here to reveal the truth! They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness!
Patrick: [humming while SpongeBob talks] Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum...
SpongeBob: I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I...
Sandals: Hey! Just get on with it!
SpongeBob: I am the one who threw the peanut! I know now that what I have done is wrong. And so I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster. I am sorry, Patrick. I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom. [Patrick stops humming]
Sandals:  Hey! Let's throw peanuts at both of them!
[crowd yelling]
Zoo Worker #1: [objecting] Wait! Here's the real criminal! [pulls Mr. Krabs out for the crowd to see]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, top of the mornin'! [his fake mustache falls off]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
[All gasping]
Patrick: I knew it!
Zoo Worker #1: Mr. Krabs has stolen a very important item from the oyster. [rips off Mr. Krabs' clothes by accident] Behold! [the crowd gets disgusted] Wait a minute... [reveals Clamu's pearl] Behold! The oyster's pearl! [The crowd gasps in shock; the zoo worker then gives the pearl to Clamu] Here you go, girl.
[Clamu sniffs her pearl and the crowd cheers. But suddenly, the pearl starts to crack. And to everyone's amazement, it hatches into a baby oyster.]
Baby Oyster: Mama! Mama!
SpongeBob: Mother of pearl! The oyster's a mother! And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg!
Baby Oyster: Mama!
Clamu: Aww!
[The baby oyster and Clamu embrace each other.]
All: Awww... [They glare at Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] But it's... Free Day!
[The crowd boos as they throw peanuts at Mr. Krabs, burying him.]


Version #1 (Original Airing/The First 100 Episodes Version)
Narrator: Ahoy, kids. It's time for SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special!
Pirates: Hooray!
Narrator: And now the host of You Wish. He's got puffier pantaloons than Captain Kidd, and fuzzier facial hair than Blackbeard. He's America's favorite Pirate, Patchy of Encino!
Patchy: [opens the door] Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to me quarters. Why don't come on back on the galley, I'm cooking up a little treat for you today. (walks inside, and to the kitchen) It's call-in-and-vote time. You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if you're technologically inclined. Now this cartoon is different from most cartoons in that-
Potty: Bawk! In what way?
Patchy: Well, if it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
Potty: Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Patchy: Argh... [Potty flies away] Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Where'd you go? [enters something] Potty? You in there, buddy? Potty? Potty?
[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window]
Potty: [laughing and squawking] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Patchy: Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Now, what was I saying? (Patchy walks to his desk with so many phones and sits down) Now, this cartoon ain't like most of your "land-lubbing cartoons". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to, call the number that's scrolling down there at the bottom of the screen: 1 (800) 624-4094 or go to Nick.com. ["1 (800) 624-4094" appears on the bottom of the screen (in the First 100 Episodes version, it says "Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!" instead). Phone starts ringing. Patchy picks up phone] No, not now! Don't call till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because- [More phones start to ring] You're not gonna make this easy, are ya? Quiet! I'm not there! Belate that ringing! Stop! It's driving me mad!
[episode starts]
SpongeBob: (yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward] Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
Squidward: [Looks at the anchor and annoyed at SpongeBob's idiocy]That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
Patrick: [Stupidly]Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
SpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?
Patrick: How about...
Squidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
SpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
Patrick: Clean...
Squidward: [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
SpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!
Patrick: Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
Narrator: A few inches later...
SpongeBob: [points up] Ship!
Patrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
SpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship![A giant green ship is seen. Patrick is shocked to see he was wrong while Squidward is not fazed.]
Squidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
Squidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
Squidward: All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says "owner" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
SpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?
Patrick: I don't know. Why?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
Patrick: Yes!
SpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says "property of the Flying Dutchman"]
Flying Dutchman: Rawr!
SpongeBob: No, no, it's not "rawr!"
Flying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob: That's it! [Stupidly]Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
Flying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
SpongeBob: [Oblivious]It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward as he waits for answer]
Squidward: [Nervously]I...no, I don't.
SpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
Squidward: [laughs nervously] I never said that.
Flying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
SpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
Squidward: [screams] Ow.
Flying Dutchman: [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back!
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
Squidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?
Patrick: Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: How 'bout now?
Patrick: Uhh...
Squidward: [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: Now listen. [takes out a "Ghost Rule Book"] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
Squidward: Will we be getting business cards?
Flying Dutchman: [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.
Squidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [holds up a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick watch Squidward disappear from sight with a clearly worried expression.]
Flying Dutchman: [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
SpongeBob: [Terrified]No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.
Patrick: [Terrified as well]We'll do anything you say!
Flying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
Patrick: And I got this hat!
Flying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
SpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
Patrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
SpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
Patrick: I don't get it.
SpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
Flying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
SpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?
Flying Dutchman: Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick are scared and start mopping]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
Flying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [bleats like a sheep]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
Flying Dutchman: [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [bleats like a sheep]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
[Very long and awkward silence]
Flying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
SpongeBob: Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy. The Flying Dutchman stares wide eyed, then nervously blows on the telescope, spinning it slightly to land on a little kid]
Billy: [sing-song voice] I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
Flying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
Patrick: Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
SpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
Flying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
Flying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confuse]
SpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
Flying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
Patrick: How does he do that?
Flying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!
Billy: Those guys are dorks.
Flying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
SpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Patrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
SpongeBob: Like movie passes?
Patrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
Flying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
SpongeBob: You're setting us free?
Flying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
Patrick: Wait, I have an idea!
SpongeBob: Really?! What is it?
Patrick: Let's leave!
SpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
Patrick: Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume. Someone even goes as far as removing Patrick's gas mask and spraying him in the face with perfume]
SpongeBob: [panting]I always hate going in there!
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
Flying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and sees SpongeBob and Patrick peeping on him before escaping.]
Flying Dutchman: [On the ship, SpongeBob and Patrick are running but the Dutchman pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
SpongeBob: Never!
Flying Dutchman: Okay, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No! [Sock begins to tear]
Flying Dutchman: [panicking]Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
Patrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Flying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
Patrick: Make it five.
Flying Dutchman: Four.
Patrick: Three. Take it or leave it.
Flying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
SpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
Patrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
Flying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [Taps Patrick on the shoulder]Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [Squidward is screaming as he falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]
Squidward: [Relieved]Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [disappears and re-appears on the ship.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back![Squidward looks around shocked.]
SpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
Squidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
Patrick: [Protesting]Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
SpongeBob: [Angrily]Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny-meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...
Voting Guy: All hands! All hands! Time to vote! It's voting time!
Patchy: Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good Ol' SpongeBob? Just dial the number below: 1 (800) 624-4094 or go to Nick.com and tell us who you be choosing. ["1 (800) 624-4094" appears on the bottom of the screen (again, in the First 100 Episodes version it has been changed to "Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!")] My trusty crew is eagerly awaiting your call. [Potty is shown sleeping against phones and a quote bubble with "Z" slides in] So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, and we'll be right back to announce...the winner! [Commercial break (in the original version, this happens)] That's it, kids! Keep calling! It's almost time! Get those votes in! A-Ha-Ha! WHOO! Democracy! A-Ha-Ha! WHOO! This is Patchy. Please hold. Potty's not here. Well, not yet. A-HA-HA-HA! [After commercial break] Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because it’s time for you to walk the plank! [Screen reads: PLEASE STAND BY] Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner! [blows horn] But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter-ology, you didn't choose...Patrick. [An image of Patrick is shown, with a skull in front of him.] But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh god!
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] My mother told me to pick the very best one and you are it! [Stops on Patrick.]
SpongeBob: That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
Patrick: Um...
Squidward: Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time... [demonstrates the length of eternity as if it were a piece of string. Patrick's eyes look at each end] Understand?!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.
Patrick: Uhh...
SpongeBob: That's not gonna do it! Think harder!
Patrick: Uhh...
Squidward and SpongeBob: [overlapping] Come on! You can do it! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Think really hard! Put on your thinking cap!
Patrick: Uhh... [Inside Patrick's eye is a toaster that brings up some toast.] Okay! I've got it.
Flying Dutchman: Thy wish is granted.
Patrick: [Chewing on gum.] Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum? [SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked.]
Squidward: You wished for gum?
Patrick: Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
[Each take a piece of gum. Later, we see Flying Dutchman with a big belly while everyone is begging for out.]
Flying Dutchman: Ahh, minty.
Patchy: Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Malarkey! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh! [An image of Squidward is shown, with a skull in front of him.] It appears you didn't vote for Squidward! I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either. But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Meeny-Miney-Mo finger landed on Squidward!
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [Stops on Squidward]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!
Squidward: That's right! And you know what I wish?
Patrick: No!
Squidward: I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Flying Dutchman: So be it.
SpongeBob: Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.
Patrick: Hi.
Squidward: That's not what I meant!
Flying Dutchman: Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner. [Flying Dutchman appears with a big belly]
SpongeBob: And what did you say your name was?
Squidward: I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
SpongeBob: Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward. [Tries to pronounce it right] We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess. [Laughs.]
Patchy: And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because it's time to announce...the winner! The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well, what do you know? The winner is...SpongeBob! [A flag is shown with SpongeBob with the words "Winner" on the left side, Patchy sniffs the air] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
Potty: Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]
Patchy: And now, the most requested ending! Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor]
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
Squidward: Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house but you can only see their heads]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Hooray!
SpongeBob: We're home!
Patrick: You did it, SpongeBob. We're safe!
Squidward: But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
Flying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. Fruit prevents scurvy! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast.]
Patchy: [sitting at the couch crying] Hold on! Sorry about that, kids! It’s just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lubbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now you're an official big time cartoon decision maker! [Cuts to a bunch of monkeys at a zoo] Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks, Potty! Potty!
Potty: Squawk! I quit! I quit!
Patchy: [growls] Well, that's it folks. Right now, I've got a little "employee management" to take care of. Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage!
Potty: Brawk! I don't think so!
Narrator: [while they argue] And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special. Thanks for voting.
Patchy: Ow!

Version #2 (Reruns)
Narrator: And now, it's time for Patchy's Pick. Hosted by: SpongeBob's number one fan, Patchy the Pirate.
Patchy: [opens the door] Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to Patchy's Pick. Why don't come on back on the galley, I got a little treat for you today. [walks to a red curtain and shows a large cue card with the title "Shanghaied" on it] We're gonna see me favorite show, "Shanghaied"! Ta-da!
Potty: Boring!
Patchy: Well, if it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
Potty: Bawk! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Patchy: Argh... [Potty flies away] Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Where'd you go? [enters something] Potty? You in there, buddy? Potty? Potty?
[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window]
Potty: [laughing and squawking] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Patchy: Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Well, roll the cartoon. [screen fades to black, episode starts]
SpongeBob: (yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward] Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
Squidward: That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
SpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?
Patrick: How about...
Squidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
SpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
Patrick: Clean...
Squidward: [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
SpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!
Patrick: Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
Narrator: A few inches later...
SpongeBob: [points up] Ship!
Patrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
SpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship!
Squidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
Squidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
Squidward: All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says "owner" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
SpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?
Patrick: I don't know. Why?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
Patrick: Yes!
SpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says "property of the Flying Dutchman"]
Flying Dutchman: Rawr!
SpongeBob: No, no, it's not "rawr!"
Flying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob: That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
Flying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
SpongeBob: It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward]
Squidward: I...no, I don't.
SpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
Squidward: [laughs nervously] I never said that.
Flying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
SpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
Squidward: [screams] Ow.
Flying Dutchman: [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back!
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
Squidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?
Patrick: Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: How 'bout now?
Patrick: Uhh...
Squidward: [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: Now listen. [takes out a "Ghost Rule Book"] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
Squidward: Will we be getting business cards?
Flying Dutchman: [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.
Squidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [shows a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick look at Squidward in blank worried faces.]
Flying Dutchman: [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
SpongeBob: No! We know our place now, Mr. Dutchman.
Patrick: We'll do anything you say!
Flying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
Patrick: And I got this hat!
Flying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
SpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
Patrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
SpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
Patrick: I don't get it.
SpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
Flying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
SpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?
Flying Dutchman: Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
Flying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [screams]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
Flying Dutchman: [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [screams]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
[Very long and awkward silence]
Flying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
SpongeBob: Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it slightly to land on a little kid]
Billy: [sing-song voice] I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
Flying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
Patrick: Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
SpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
Flying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
Flying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confused]
SpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
Flying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
Patrick: How does he do that?
Flying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!
Billy: Those guys are dorks.
Flying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
SpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Patrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
SpongeBob: Like movie passes?
Patrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
Flying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
SpongeBob: You're setting us free?
Flying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
Patrick: Wait, I have an idea!
SpongeBob: Really?! What is it?
Patrick: Let's leave!
SpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
Patrick: Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
SpongeBob: I always hate going in there!
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
Flying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
SpongeBob: Never!
Flying Dutchman: Okay, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob, but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No! [Sock begins to tear]
Flying Dutchman: Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
Patrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Flying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.

SpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
Squidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
Patrick: Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
SpongeBob: Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny-meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
Squidward: Hurry, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?

Patrick: You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!
Squidward: But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
Flying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. [slices some fruits to the blender] Fruit prevents scurvy! [he whistles as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward scream and bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Ahoy, children! I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls enjoyed the show because it's time for you to walk the plank! [Screen reads: PLEASE STAND BY] Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time for fan mail! [blows horn]
Old-time crowd: Hooray!
Patchy: And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, so get ready to blow milk out of your nose because we're gonna open a letter! [Potty flies to Patchy with the letter. There is a lit fuse on Potty's head] The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant.
Potty: Brawk, you're not welcome.
Patchy: [sniffs the air] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? [notices the fuse] Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
Potty: Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]
Patchy: Well, that's it for Patchy's Pick. Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor and Patchy frowns]

Different endings
There are various endings to "Shanghaied". Differences between each other are the different fates of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, depending on who the Flying Dutchman picked. Below are the different endings:

SpongeBob's ending

Patrick: You did it SpongeBob. We're saved!
Squidward: But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
Flying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. Fruit prevents scurvy! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast. Patchy reappears]

Patrick's ending
[...]
Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on Patrick]
SpongeBob: [worried] That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
Patrick: Umm...
Squidward: Wait, Patrick. Listen, I do not particularly want to be trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time... [demonstrates the length of eternity as if it were a piece of string. Patrick's eyes look at each end] Understand?
SpongeBob: [rushes in] Patrick, you've got to think harder than you ever thought before.
Patrick: Uhh...
SpongeBob: That's not going to do it! Think harder!
Patrick: [thinks harder] Uhh...
Squidward: [simultaneously with SpongeBob] You can do it! Come on! Put on your thinking cap! Come on!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously with Squidward] Come on, Patrick! Yes, think, think really hard! [Patrick goes really intensely thinking] Yes, Patrick! You're doing good!
Patrick: [his head's toaster ejects bread] Okay! I got it!
Flying Dutchman: Thou wish is granted.
[Gum appears in Patrick's pocket. Patrick eats some gum.]
Patrick: Oh, I'm sorry... Want some gum?
[SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked]
Squidward: You wished for gum?
Patrick: Well, if we're going to be there forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
[SpongeBob and Squidward take a piece of gum each and chews some gum as well]
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward complain in the Flying Dutchman's belly]
Flying Dutchman: Ahh... Minty!

Squidward's ending
[...]
Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on Squidward]
SpongeBob: Squidward! You get to have a wish! A great big wish!
Squidward: That's right! And you know what I wish?
Patrick: No!
Squidward: I wish that I never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Flying Dutchman: So be it. [magically makes SpongeBob and Patrick not know Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hi there. I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob and this is my associate Patrick.
Patrick: Hi.
Squidward: That's not what I meant!
Flying Dutchman: Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner. [grabs out a metal knife and fork]
SpongeBob: [in the Flying Dutchman's belly] And what did you say your name was?
Squidward: [also in the Flying Dutchman's belly] I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
SpongeBob: Oh, nice to meet you, Squid Ward. We have plenty of time to know each other, I guess. [laughs]

Version #3 (Without Patchy Segments)
 SpongeBob: (yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward]Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
 Squidward: That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
 Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
 SpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?
 Patrick: How about...
 Squidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
 SpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
 Patrick: Clean...
 Squidward: [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
 SpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
 SpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!
 Patrick: Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
 Narrator: A few inches later...
 SpongeBob: [points up] Ship!
 Patrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
 SpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship!
 Squidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
 SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
 Squidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
 SpongeBob: Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
 Squidward: All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says "owner" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
 SpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?
 Patrick: I don't know. Why?
 SpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
 Patrick: Yes!
 SpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says "property of the Flying Dutchman"]
 Flying Dutchman: Rawr!
 SpongeBob: No, no, it's not "rawr!"
 Flying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!
 SpongeBob: That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
 Flying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
 SpongeBob: It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward]
 Squidward: I...no, I don't.
 SpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
 Squidward: [laughs nervously] I never said that.
 Flying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
 SpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
 Squidward: [screams] Ow.
 Flying Dutchman: [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
 SpongeBob and Patrick: [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
 Flying Dutchman: Welcome back!
 SpongeBob: [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
 Flying Dutchman: Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
 Squidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
 Flying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?
 Patrick: Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
 Flying Dutchman: How 'bout now?
 Patrick: Uhh...
 Squidward: [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
 Flying Dutchman: Now listen. [takes out a "Ghost Rule Book"] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book]And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
 Squidward: Will we be getting business cards?
 Flying Dutchman: [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.
 Squidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [shows a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick look at Squidward in blank worried faces.]
 Flying Dutchman: [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
 SpongeBob: No! We know our place now, Mr. Dutchman.
 Patrick: We'll do anything you say!
 Flying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
 SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
 Patrick: And I got this hat!
 Flying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
 SpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
 Patrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
 SpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
 Patrick: I don't get it.
 SpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
 Flying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
 SpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?
 Flying Dutchman: Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
 SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
 Flying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
 SpongeBob: [screams]
 Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
 Flying Dutchman: [howls like a wolf]
 SpongeBob: [screams]
 Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
 [Very long and awkward silence]
 Flying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
 SpongeBob: Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it slightly to land on a little kid]
 Billy: [sing-song voice] I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
 Flying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
 Patrick: Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
 SpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
 Flying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
 Flying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confused]
 SpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
 Flying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
 Patrick: How does he do that?
 Flying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.
 SpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!
 Billy: Those guys are dorks.
 Flying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
 SpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
 Patrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
 SpongeBob: Like movie passes?
 Patrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
 Flying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
 SpongeBob: You're setting us free?
 Flying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
 Patrick: Wait, I have an idea!
 SpongeBob: Really?! What is it?
 Patrick: Let's leave!
 SpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
 Patrick: Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
 SpongeBob: I always hate going in there!
 Patrick: Yeah.
 SpongeBob: [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
 Flying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
 SpongeBob: Never!
 Flying Dutchman: Okay, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob, but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection]Give it to me!
 SpongeBob: No! [Sock begins to tear]
 Flying Dutchman: Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
 Patrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.
 Flying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
 Patrick: Make it five.
 Flying Dutchman: Four.
 Patrick: Three. Take it or leave it.
 Flying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
 SpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
 Patrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
 Flying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]
 SpongeBob: Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]
 Squidward: Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [re-appears on the ship]
 SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back!
 SpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
 Squidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
 Patrick: Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
 SpongeBob: Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
 Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [then one of the above endings.]


SpongeBob: Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time! [Gary's pupils dilate] Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way, [zooms in on Gary's eyes] or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way... [Gary just stares] So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
SpongeBob: Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch! [Throws the ball to Gary. Toy boomerangs back to SpongeBob and he reads the box] Huh? "New" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm. [throws the box but it boomerangs back and hits SpongeBob in the head]
SpongeBob: [with a bomb strapped to his chest] Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath! [Gary doesn't react] Please...? [bomb explodes] I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages!
[pictures of a bathtub, a shower faucet running, and then a bar of soap come up, then a disturbing picture of a giggling girl appears]
Subliminal Girl: [high-pitched laugh]
SpongeBob: Sorry you had to see that. [on the phone] Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath. [person on the other side is talking] What? Can you say that again? [Gary slithers away] Slow down! It's like you're speaking some other language! [hangs up] Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leapfrog? Weehee! Okay, your turn. [flips Gary into the wall and breaks his shell, then we see Gary with his shell bandaged] Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leapfrog? [Gary whacks him on the head with a cane] ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house! [Mr. Krabs comes in taking a bath then takes SpongeBob's dollar] Ya-da-da-da... [stops dancing] That didn't work either, huh? [Gary is sleeping. SpongeBob, who is dressed as a pirate, runs to Gary, who wakes up] Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house! Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure! Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen... [nervously looks at Gary] 40. The treasure must be in here! [opens bathroom door] Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Why, no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub. [Kicks away a paint can] It's treasure! Look, doubloons! [shows 2 bars of soap] Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch! [shows a rubber ducky]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is on SpongeBob] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but he floats over the tub, and appears back on the floor after 2 seconds] Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to... [pulls up Gary off the floor but both end up dangling from the ceiling] Gary, could you... [Gary sucks in one of his eyes into his head and SpongeBob loses his grip] Gary, no! [Gary pulls in other eye] Gary! [SpongeBob falls in the tub]. Alright, Gary, you have duped and/or frustrated me for the last time! So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. [absorbs all the water in the bathtub]. Psst, Gary. Bath delivery! [SpongeBob spits water at Gary but misses and hits the armchair instead]. Come back, Gary! I have something to "chair" with you. [SpongeBob spits more water at Gary but misses and hits dirty dishes, which cleans and stacks them] "Dish" is more like it! "Water" you waiting for, Gary?
Gary: [meowing in a tree]
SpongeBob: Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary! [spits out water at Gary but realizes it's a gramophone playing a record of Gary's meows]. Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin! [Gary, while meowing mockingly, takes the ladder off the tree] Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant! [ladder falls down] I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath and you are going to get clean right now!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I am so the boss of you!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say. [Gary slithers forward] What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister! [Gary stops right next to some mud] Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary The Snail, do you hear me? I am giving you 3 seconds to get away from that mud puddle! 1, [Gary moves closer to the mud] 2, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two and a half... [Gary leans over the mud] don't make me say 3! [Gary leans further over the mud] Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!! [SpongeBob falls out of the tree and into the mud] I'm a dirty boy... [SpongeBob is in the bathtub]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, Gary. [scrubs his ears] I'm getting behind my ears. [Gary grins]


[The Krusty Krab at night. The lights are still on]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob! It's quittin' time! [the lights turn off and Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk out] I've got a card game tonight. [he locks the doors]
SpongeBob: Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs? [we see the Chum Bucket across the street, with its lights still on]
Mr. Krabs: I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton. [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: [Gasps] Plankton?! [a thought bubble appears over SpongeBob's head with Plankton inside] But, Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy! [he picks up a Krabby Patty] He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years! [the Plankton in the thought bubble sees the Krabby Patty and goes to get it, but SpongeBob squishes him with a fly swatter.]
Plankton: Ouch. [the thought bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Why would you play cards with him?
Mr. Krabs: Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom! [cut to him and Plankton holding cards and a giant stack of money on the table] Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years! [Mr. Krabs puts his cards down on the table and rakes in his money with his claws. Back to the present, Mr. Krabs' eyes have turned to dollar signs] I never lose! [the two start laughing and walk off their separate ways. Cut to the morning where Mr. Krabs walks to work crying, and SpongeBob walks in laughing.]
SpongeBob: Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one! [Mr. Krabs leans against the Krusty Krab doors] How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I lost.
SpongeBob: Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?
Mr. Krabs: I didn't lose any money. [he sheds away a tear] I lost...
SpongeBob: Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: I lost... [SpongeBob grabs him]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Mr. Krabs: I lost... [he points to SpongeBob] you!
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: I bet your contract and I lost. [SpongeBob stares blankly, then laughs]
SpongeBob: Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties. [he begins to walk to the door, but Mr. Krabs' claw stops him. After continually walking and getting nowhere, he falls to the floor]
Mr. Krabs: I'm afraid you don't work here anymore. [Squidward runs out the door to the two]
Squidward: Please tell me this isn't a joke.
SpongeBob: Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke. [Plankton walks over]
Plankton: As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking. [he points at SpongeBob] You work for me now, SpongeBob. [he whips out a bucket with the initials "CB" on it] Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet. [he jumps onto SpongeBob's head, kicks off the Krusty Krew hat and puts the bucket on his head. SpongeBob screams and runs to Mr. Krabs while knocking Plankton and the bucket off his head]
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him! [he tugs at Krabs' shirt collar] I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab! [he and Krabs start crying loudly and hug]
Mr. Krabs: I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!
Plankton: [pretending to sound genuinely sad] What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship? [whips out a crowbar] I would! [he jumps up and uses the crowbar to pry SpongeBob off Krabs. SpongeBob goes flying with Mr. Krabs' arms still clung to him]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! [he slams into a cage and Krabs' arms fly off him. Plankton walks over and shuts the door]
Plankton: This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For fifteen years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em! [a propeller emerges from the cage] I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs! [the propeller spins and pilots SpongeBob into the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [he cries] Can I have my arms back? [Plankton walks over and throws the arms on Krabs' head. Cut to the cage hovering over a spotlight and dropping SpongeBob into it]
SpongeBob: What is this place? [the lights turn on and screens with wires and gizmos start starting up. SpongeBob gasps. A giant boiler turns on. SpongeBob yelps. A light turns on and a calendar entitled "Science!" appears and the photo of the month is some nerd in front of a blackboard. SpongeBob screams. Plankton bursts open the doors]
Plankton: Okay, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty! [he walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh...
Plankton: Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now [he jumps onto SpongeBob's knee] and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef! [we see a giant robot that bears a slight resemblance to SpongeBob] So get cooking. [he twangs SpongeBob's nose. Later, SpongeBob is in front of a weird looking grill. He picks up a spatula with a spring end. He puts his fingers to one of the holes in the grill and steam bursts from it. SpongeBob screams. He looks at a digital sign reading "KITCHEN"]
SpongeBob: The sign says "kitchen", but my heart says "jail". ♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪A patty is a patty, that's what I say.♪
SpongeBob: ♪A grill is a grill, this is surely so,♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪And fries should be fries, either way.♪
SpongeBob: ♪But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know.♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪I would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay.♪
Unison: ♪This kitchen's not the same without you.♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪It's just a greasy spoon♪
SpongeBob: ♪It's just a greasy spoon...♪
Unison: ♪...without you.♪ [SpongeBob cries]
Plankton: What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.
Karen: You know that never works! The answer is obvious: to get to the SpongeBob, you must show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give you what you want.
Plankton: Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.
[We see SpongeBob struggling to make a Krabby Patty with one of Plankton's cooking machines]
SpongeBob: [Sound of surprise]
Plankton: Hi!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!
Plankton: Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.
SpongeBob: Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?
SpongeBob: Well, I usually cook on a grill.
Plankton: You got it! [Plankton brings a grill into the Chum Bucket] Well, it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.
Plankton: Say no more, I'll take care of everything. [Plankton pushes the grill] How about here?
SpongeBob: A little more to the left.
Plankton: How's this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Move it over a little more.
Plankton: Here?
SpongeBob: Keep going.
Plankton: Here?
SpongeBob: Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right.
Plankton: [cut to a blindfolded SpongeBob] Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Okay, go ahead, take it off! [he removes the blindfold] It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!
SpongeBob: It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs! [his face turns sad. wailing] Oh...Mr. Krabs!
Plankton: Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?
SpongeBob: Well...there is one thing I've always wanted... [cut to SpongeBob with some fancy vibrating shoes on] Wow!
Plankton: So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: Well... [cut to SpongeBob in a bubble bath, licking green mint ice cream]
Plankton: You ready to make some patties?
SpongeBob: Wait ‘til I finish my ice cream! [cut to SpongeBob riding a toy seahorse, with Plankton pushing him]
Plankton: [while pushing him] How about those patties?
SpongeBob: Faster! Faster! Faster! [cut to Plankton reading to SpongeBob a baby book]
Plankton: And then the littlest sea-elf said... [drool drops on Plankton. SpongeBob is sleeping. He wakes up] Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?
SpongeBob: All this preparation is making me hungry.
Plankton: Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.
Plankton: [laughs] Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?
SpongeBob: [yawning] No, I don't really feel like it!
Plankton: But I don't understand. [SpongeBob drinks soda from a cup] You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair. [loses his cool as he exposes his hands with fumes rising out] I rubbed your putrid feet!
SpongeBob: Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later!
Plankton: [growls in fury] I command you to make me a patty this instant!
SpongeBob: [crossing his arms in refusal] No!
Plankton: Don't back sass me!
SpongeBob: [mocking Plankton] Do ba da ma!
Plankton: What?! [SpongeBob blows a raspberry as he moons at him] That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges. [cut to Plankton outside of a lab] Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants... [to the audience] I put the brain in the robot, you know. [to Robot SpongeBob] You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want. And I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!
Robot SpongeBob: [Beeping] Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response: Why don't you ask me later?
Plankton: [going mad] What? What?!
Robot SpongeBob: Get welded.
Plankton: [pressing the button on the control] Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!
Robot SpongeBob:  [Reads a comic and drinks oil] I don't wanna.
Plankton: [screams out of madness]
Mr. Krabs: [cut to the Krusty Krab] Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter. [holds up an "Out of Business" sign] Huh?
Plankton: [crying] I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.
Mr. Krabs: Um...Well... [taking off the "Out of Business" sign off the doors] a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.
Plankton: Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!
Mr. Krabs: How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands.
Plankton: It's a deal! I cheated anyway.
Mr. Krabs: Now, be gone with you, you puny pest! [Mr. Krabs throws Plankton back inside the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: Thank you! [a crashing sound is heard] Ouch.
SpongeBob: My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!
SpongeBob: [Yawns] I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, Krabby? [laughs; Mr. Krabs glares at him] I mean...I'm working all day for free! My treat! [runs to the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: That's what I thought you said.

French Narrator: Well, well, what is this? Ah, the artist at sea. Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck.
Artist: Hmm... ah! [He kisses his pencil, then he draws some more strokes. He hums something. He accidentally throws his pencil into the sea. It sinks in the water until it's out of sight]
Artist: My pencil! [searches for it in the sea] What? No, no!
French Narrator: The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: Always bring a spare pencil.
Artist: Noooooo! [with a loudly sound. Cut to the pencil dropping into the water. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with bubbles]
SpongeBob: Okay. Ready, Patrick? One...
Patrick: Two...
Both: Three!
[SpongeBob blows a scissors bubble and Patrick blows a paper bubble]
SpongeBob: Scissors beats paper, Patrick! [they both laugh at that] One...
Both: two...
SpongeBob: Three! [both blow paper bubbles] Patrick, how come you always do paper? [the pencil pops the two paper bubbles and drops in the sand and the two scream while running around. They both hide behind the Pineapple away from the pencil.]
Patrick: What is that thing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It looks like a giant pencil!
Patrick: Go touch it!
[SpongeBob extends his arm and touches the pencil]
SpongeBob: It is a giant pencil, Patrick! [SpongeBob grabs the pencil] Let's draw some giant pictures with it.
Patrick: Whatcha drawin'?
SpongeBob: Stand back, Patrick. I can't draw with you breathing down my neck.
Patrick: Psshh, artists.
SpongeBob: It's a jellyfish.
Patrick: Pretty good, SpongeBob, but it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired.
SpongeBob: Eh, everybody's a critic.
[The drawing comes to life and swims away buzzing]
Patrick: SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!
SpongeBob: Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic.
Patrick: No, I mean it's swimming away!
SpongeBob: Do you know what this means, Patrick?
Patrick: Your art can never hang in a museum.
SpongeBob: It means we found a magic pencil!
Patrick: Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Coming right up! [he draws mustache on Patrick's face]
Patrick: Life is good! [the mustache floats away. He shrugs] Easy come, easy go...
Squidward: Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea. You've got looks, talent, all you need is a full head of... [the mustache goes on his head] HAIR!
Patrick: My turn!
SpongeBob: Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such.
Patrick: Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.
SpongeBob: Okay! Why didn't you say so?
[Patrick draws a crudely-drawn picture of Squidward with a small stature and a waving fist.]
SpongeBob: Hey! Another jellyfish!
Patrick: It's Squidward, silly!
[The badly drawn Squidward comes to life and grumbles at them]
SpongeBob: It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.
Patrick: You're right, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: We can't let it go into town! [Patrick erases it]
Patrick: Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hey! My brain just hatched an idea. [he draws a dollar on Squidward's green mat, attached to a string while laughing] This is gonna be classic!
Squidward: [dressed up] I think I fancy a stroll around the park.
SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: [opens door] What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy! [SpongeBob pulls the string] Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair! [it floats away] SpongeBob!
[Squidward goes back inside and slams the door, Patrick and SpongeBob laugh while hopping up and down and suddenly stop]
SpongeBob: Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me! [SpongeBob draws a doodle of himself, Patrick laughs. The drawing stands up] Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie. [Draws it] Ready for action! 
[The SpongeBob doodle shouts nonsense and he runs over to Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Patrick: He's going to the door.
[DoodleBob knocks on the door]
SpongeBob: He's knockin' on the door. Squidward's answering the door... aaaaand...
[DoodleBob picks up Squidward, holding him upside-down and repeatedly pounds his head on the ground]
Squidward: OOH! OWW, OWW, OW!
Patrick: He's beating up Squidward! Ha! Ha! Ha!
[Patrick and SpongeBob watch DoodleBob slam Squidward back and forth]
SpongeBob: DoodleBoy, stop! [DoodleBob throws Squidward back in his house. Then he steals the magic pencil and then runs away with it]
Patrick: He's got the pencil.
SpongeBob: What have I done? We've got to find him!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick in a field with tall bushes] 
SpongeBob: Where could he possibly be?
Patrick: Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.
SpongeBob: Come on, let's go! [Patrick hides in a bush]
Patrick: I'm not going in there [SpongeBob also hides]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there... [DoodleBob draws a hole. They fall into it]
Patrick: What just happened?
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense] Meahoy, memoyay? Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!
Patrick: Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?
SpongeBob: No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him. [a giant wrench falls and hits Patrick on the head]
DoodleBob: Neofineyin!
SpongeBob: See what I mean, Patrick?
Patrick: [dizzily] WHERE'S THE LEAK, MA'AM? [DoodleBob draws a bowling ball and rolls it. Patrick's head turns into a bowling pin in surprise] Yurrgh! [Hits Patrick and some pink bowling pins and a "strike" symbol appears. Another "strike" symbol then appears after the bowling ball falls into the hole]
SpongeBob: You okay, Patrick?
Patrick: FINLAND!
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense and more nonsense] Meyaiovah! Mee hoy minoy! Meah froyay! [he runs off in the distance, Bubble transition to a coral rock wall and a field]
SpongeBob: There he is.
Patrick: He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie! [SpongeBob looks down at his own clothes]
SpongeBob: Uh... *ahem*.
Patrick: [blushes] Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob. Heh heh!
SpongeBob: He's putting down the pencil. This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him.
Patrick: Ooh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?
[DoodleBob breaks through the coral rock wall where SpongeBob and Patrick are hiding behind.]
DoodleBob: [nonsense] Bawahh bwah bwah wahh! [DoodleBob grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick!! Patrick! Do something!
Patrick: Happy Birthday!
[DoodleBob throws SpongeBob, who screams and lands with a thud in the distance]
Patrick: [Gives DoodleBob a rock] Here's your present. [DoodleBob bashes it on his head] You're welcome.
DoodleBob: [nonsense] Dewaaagheaugaaagh! [DoodleBob was about to run for his life until SpongeBob stops him whilst holding the pencil in his face]
SpongeBob: Hold it right there, Doodle! I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense fast] EEDAHFAAWAHOBABOBBA!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, what was that?
DoodleBob: [Slowing gibberish down] Ee...DAh...Faawa...HobaBobba... [DoodleBob starts to shout more gibberish while SpongeBob erases his face. DoodleBob mutters, then he hits a rock]
SpongeBob: Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good. [begins to erase DoodleBob to oblivion] Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...! [he screams in victory] I AM SPONGEBOB, DESTROYER OF EVIL!
Patrick: Take it easy. It's just a drawing.
SpongeBob: [calmly] Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?
Patrick: Done and done.
[When SpongeBob and Patrick go home, it is soon revealed that one of DoodleBob's arms is still alive. It creeps out from under the rock. Cut to nighttime. SpongeBob had just returned home. He draws on the spaces of his bedroom to make it look like a fancy bedroom, complete with a canopy for his bed.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince.
Gary: [with a crown on] Meeeoowww.
SpongeBob: Good night, magic pencil. [Falls asleep. DoodleBob's arm goes into SpongeBob's house, it starts going up the stairs and takes a bathroom break, finally he sneaks up to SpongeBob's bed, grabs the pencil, and starts to re-draw himself. He wakes up] Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water? [laughs] [DoodleBob pops up in his bed] AAAAH! DOODLEBOB! Heh heh, no hard feelings, right? [DoodleBob draws two angry eyebrows on his face and jumps on SpongeBob's bed holding the pencil threateningly] [screams] What do you think you're doing, doodle?!
DoodleBob: You Doodle! Me SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams and jump out of the ways as DoodleBob erases his pillow, then part of SpongeBob's house whilst chasing him, they chase downstairs. DoodleBob erases a door and the back of SpongeBob's pants, revealing his butt] Huh? [Erases his butt]
SpongeBob: [screams] Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen? [DoodleBob erases his nose] I nose. [DoodleBob erases some parts of his face and body, DoodleBob laughs at the way he looks now] Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn. [When SpongeBob and DoodleBob struggle, the pencil breaks into two. SpongeBob has the lead and draws the rest of his face and body back] Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw. [DoodleBob sharpens the pencil with his mouth. He now has both sides] You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school. [the lead piece flies out of his hand, crashes through the window and hits Squidward]
Squidward: [offscreen] Ow! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!
SpongeBob: Or maybe it was most clumsy. [DoodleBob starts to attack him again as SpongeBob hides in a bookshelf, as DoodleBob approaches him, he gets his foot stuck in a piece of paper on the floor, DoodleBob sees this and tries to get it off] Huh? [SpongeBob looks in a book] Paper! [DoodleBob tosses the pencil from his hand] Page for Mr. Doodle! [Smashes him with a notebook. SpongeBob watches as DoodleBob is preserved as a drawing, when it was all over, he smiles. The next day, SpongeBob hangs the piece of paper on the wall with a push-pin]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?
SpongeBob: Take a look for yourself, Patrick.
Patrick: [Gasp!] It's the evil Doodle!
SpongeBob: No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose. [he blows from a pipe]
Patrick: So... he's a drawing?
SpongeBob: Exactly! See how happy he is?
Patrick: [He looks at the paper with DoodleBob on it] He still looks kind of creepy.
[Cut to outside. SpongeBob has just drawn a diving board. The pencil's broken halves have recently been taped together.]
SpongeBob: Oh, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?
Patrick: Ready! [SpongeBob drops the pencil into Patrick's mouth. SpongeBob jumps from the diving board and onto Patrick's chest, and the pencil is launched back to the surface. In the real world, the artist from earlier is curled up in a fetal position]
French Narrator: We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.
Artist: [the pencil reaches the surface and lands on him] Huh? What's this? [he jumps up and holds his pencil in joy] My pencil! [he tries to draw, but unfortunately, the pencil lead breaks]
French Narrator: [As the artist starts to cry] The second most important rule for the artist at sea: Always bring a pencil sharpener.
Artist: NOOOOO!!!



SpongeBob: [as he runs to Patrick's rock] Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing? [Patrick comes out of his rock with a box, doing an acrobatic trick]
Patrick: Oh, boy, am I!
SpongeBob: Here's your net. [Patrick glances at his box] Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.
Patrick: First, I have to put away my secret box.
SpongeBob: Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box! [SpongeBob tries to peek in the box, but Patrick pulls it away]
Patrick: Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh! [opens the box, laughs at it, and shuts it as SpongeBob tries to peek it] Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life! [SpongeBob gets behind Patrick to see what's inside the box, but Patrick holds it to himself]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.
Patrick: You do?
SpongeBob: I've got a gazillion secrets!
Patrick: Like what?
SpongeBob: Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly. [Patrick drools as the top of his head has lightning bolts coming out of it, showing that he couldn't understand the whole sentence]
SpongeBob: You wanna hear one of my secrets?
Patrick: Do I?
SpongeBob: Uhh... Let's see... [he runs up to Patrick] Did you know that you're my best friend? [he runs away]
Patrick: No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!
SpongeBob: Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve.
Patrick: Wow! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh. [SpongeBob clears his throat and taps on Patrick's box] Tell me some more secrets!
SpongeBob: Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think jellyfishing and bubble-blowing are the... [transition to SpongeBob still telling secrets as Patrick lays his head on the box] ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word "fancy" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now. [he shows his three pairs of underwear to Patrick]
Patrick: Gasp. I never would have guessed.
SpongeBob: Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. [Patrick imagines a carton of milk spilling itself]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh… [close-up of SpongeBob's socks] I've got my secret socks on. [he runs away and comes back with Gary's bowl] And my secret Gary's bowl! [he runs away then comes back, pulling his television] My secret TV! [turns on the TV] And my secret TV channel. [the TV shows an off-air color bars screen] What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: [he giggles, then laughs loudly after a gander at the box and then stops to breathe. He looks again and laughs harder and wildly. He stops to breathe] Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret. [he shows the box to SpongeBob] Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the mystery of the box. [SpongeBob tries to peek inside the box, but Patrick slams it shut] Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house. [scene zooms out to show Squidward's Tiki Head home looking down at SpongeBob and Patrick, who notice the looks before it goes back to normal] It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna… [gasps when he finds out his box is gone, The scene cuts to a laughing SpongeBob running with Patrick's secret box, but then he bumps into Patrick's belly] SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!
SpongeBob: [Struggles with Patrick on the box] But, Patrick, I must know the secret!
Patrick: [Struggles with SpongeBob on the box] For the last time, SpongeBob, no!
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, just a peek?
Patrick: Never! [SpongeBob and Patrick strain as they fight over the box. Eventually, SpongeBob's arms pop off and he gasps] So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club! [he shows his finger with the ring on it and then the camera zooms in on the ring. He grabs one of SpongeBob's arms and points it at SpongeBob] Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants! [as he pokes SpongeBob's nose with his arm] If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!
SpongeBob: But... we're supposed to be... [his eyes get big and sad] friends forever. [flashback to SpongeBob and Patrick as babies in a crib laughing, then we see them as kids riding on a bike, then as they are now, riding a bike, then as older men in rocking chairs, then we see a shot of two gravestones with their names and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick still laughing, but they are buried. The flashback ends.] I feel so filthy! [he starts to cry] I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself! [he jumps on Patrick] I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!
Patrick: Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever? [we see a close-up of Patrick's box] The most amazing... [as he sticks the box in SpongeBob's eyes, the eyes pop out of him and then back in] mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom. [he eyes are glued to the box for a moment, and then goes back to him]
SpongeBob: So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?
Patrick: Friends. [they shake hands. Cuts to a night view of SpongeBob's house, then inside as SpongeBob talks]
SpongeBob: What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish! [he slides down in his bed] Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds. [he sits up] Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box. [he hides himself in the blanket and shivers] Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party! [screams, then jumps onto the bedroom window and talks a little muffled] I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do! [SpongeBob's face pops off and sticks onto his back] That's it! How do you look in a secret box? [he jumps off the window] Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back. [he turns around to show only his nose. He turns back around] Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary? [Gary narrows his eyes]
Gary: Meeh… No. [cut to the outside]
SpongeBob: Oh, what do you know? You're a snail! [SpongeBob sneaks over to Patrick's house, puts gloves and a ski mask on him, crawls up the rock with his back, and tears him in half and gets both halves under the rock. He then lands and notices Patrick. He then screams gibberish, drools and SpongeBob hides behind the portrait of SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob then peeks and then the wall starts to crack. Patrick mumbles, the wall breaks even more and then the nail falls off. He then grabs the nail with his foot and puts it back.]
Patrick: [as the camera zooms in on the box] Seee... cret.
SpongeBob: [thinking] I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up. [slides down the wall from the portrait and makes a loud noise upon touching the floor. Patrick stretches and then goes back to sleep. SpongeBob then lifts his leg and then Patrick makes another noise. He then tosses himself over on the bed. SpongeBob puts his leg down, which makes a loud noise]
Patrick: Duh... who's there? [he mumbles then goes back to sleep.]
SpongeBob: [talking to his foot] Shhh! [SpongeBob steps on a potato chip and makes a broken glass sound]
Patrick: Eh?! [gibberish] Who's that?! [Patrick is back asleep. SpongeBob sweeps his sweat drops off him and they land, causing a loud splash sound.] Mmm... water. [he licks his mouth dry, then tosses himself on the bed. SpongeBob takes another step and makes an "AWOOOOGA!" noise. He then steps again, making a loud machine gun noise. Steps again, making the sound of an elephant. He then stretches his leg near the side of the bed, then takes the step, making a very loud crashing noise. He then peeks above Patrick to see the box. He gets ready to reach for the box, but Patrick takes the box before SpongeBob could grab it. He then slides onto Patrick, grabbing the box] Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside. [opens SpongeBob's mouth and pulls out his tongue, then laughs. He lets go of his tongue] Nighty-night, boxie. [he puts SpongeBob on the side of the bed. SpongeBob gets off the bed and then trips on a shoestring, causing him to bounce around Patrick's house, making a lot of loud noises until his head hits the wall, causing the portrait to fall off the wall, hitting him in the head, breaking the portrait half. The box then lands on SpongeBob and makes a loud noise. The scene cuts back to Patrick, who, despite all the noise, continues to sleep]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. [Patrick wakes up]
Patrick: Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!
SpongeBob: Uh…
Patrick: It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box! [he runs up to SpongeBob] Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life! [he readies his pillow like a shotgun ready to suffocate him]
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! [takes off his mask] It's me, SpongeBob!
Patrick: [stares at him while clueless] Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me.
SpongeBob: No, really, Patrick! Look! [Patrick gasps. SpongeBob presses a button on the ring]
SpongeBob and Patrick BFF Ring: It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!
Patrick: Our friendship ring! It is you! [crying as he covers his face with his pillow] How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!?
SpongeBob: If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside. [he throws the pillow away and snatches the box out of SpongeBob's hands]
Patrick: [with a tear coming out of his eye] That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is over!
SpongeBob: [gasps and tears up] Really?
Patrick: Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to.
SpongeBob: Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes! [he lifts the lid off the box] Huh?
Patrick: Well, didn't I tell ya? [we see a string inside the box] Isn't it great?
SpongeBob: It's just a string.
Patrick: A secret string!
SpongeBob: Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that! [he puts the lid back on the box] Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!
Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob pops out of Patrick's house]
SpongeBob: I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along! [he laughs] Wait 'till I tell Gary!
Patrick: [laughs menacingly] Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the... [a secret compartment opens] ...secret compartment of my secret box... [he takes out a photo] ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party! [cut to the Bikini Atoll] Merry Christmas, SpongeBob! [laughs as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]


Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about...
Squidward: [talks cheerfully as he switches the "Open" sign to "Closed"] Now! 8:00! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is: [pulls out his clarinet] Clarinet. [Tom shows up at the door and knocks on it, causing Squidward to drop his clarinet] What?
Tom: Are you open?
Squidward: [points to the sign] Read the sign.
Tom: [ignores him] I'll have a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a Double Chili Kelp Fries.
Squidward: NO, YOU WON'T. I can't hang out here all night. I've got a life!
Tom: Well, fine, if you don't want my money!
Mr. Krabs: [says cheerfully] Money?! [Mr. Krabs then falls from the ceiling on top of Squidward] You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?
Tom: [pulls out cash; Sadie, an anchovy, and an old man appear behind him] Sure!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, [tears up the "Closed" sign] welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day.
Squidward: What!? [crowd of fish barge in cheering]
SpongeBob: Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life. [leaves]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working! [gasps] It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease! [jumps on cash register counter] Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
Squidward: [Sandals walks up to counter; Squidward hands him a baseball bat] Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.
SpongeBob: Pst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen [laughs] at night!
Squidward: [takes hat off; leans head on counter] Don't hold back.
SpongeBob: [cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen] Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob in the bathroom wiping it clean with himself] Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob at the grill picking up spatula, misses the spatula and hits the grill; screams] I burned my hand!...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob walking on the counter, singing to the tune of Charge] Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! NIGHT!
Squidward: WILL YOU PLEASE?! Here, [hands SpongeBob a bag of garbage] give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!
SpongeBob: All right! [takes bag from Squidward] Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night. [stops at the door] You mean outside?
Squidward: That's where the dumpster is, yes.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward, [leans face against window] it's kinda dark out there.
Squidward: But I thought you liked the night shift.
SpongeBob: You're right! [lifts bag over his head] FOR THE KRUSTY KRAB! [runs out of the building to the dumpster, panicking the whole way] AHHHHHaahhAAAhhhhhhAahhaAAAAAAHHHaaaAaaAAaAhhhhAAhhahahAAHh! [reenters the building panting heavily. He confidently snaps his fingers] Piece of cake.
Squidward: So you're not afraid?
SpongeBob: Pfft, nah.
Squidward: Well I am. Especially after, [looks around, gulps] well, you know.
SpongeBob: [turns around] What? What do I know?
Squidward: You don't remember? It was all over the news.
SpongeBob: Tell me, tell me!
Squidward: No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you. [gives a sympathetic look, then smiles slyly]
SpongeBob: [excitedly] What happened, what happened, what happened!?
Squidward: You mean you've never heard the story of the [thinks] "Hash-Slinging Slasher?"
SpongeBob: The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
SpongeBob: The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, [a boring-looked Squidward frowns] The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.
Squidward: Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha---[breaks into scream] because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!
SpongeBob: [begging] Tell me the story!
Squidward: Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.
SpongeBob: He forgot the secret sauce?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: He didn't wash his hands?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Irregular portions?
Squidward: No!! He cut off his own hand by mistake!
SpongeBob: You mean like this? [pulls one of his arms out of socket, another one grows back in its place] Or like this? [pulls it again, another one grows back] Or this? [does it again] Or this? [does it again] But what about this! Or this, or this, or this, or...
Squidward: [interrupts] Except he wasn't a sponge.
SpongeBob: [ask with all his extra hands creating a rainbow-like line] So?
Squidward: So it didn't grow back!
SpongeBob: [screams] OH, NO!!! [all his extra arms lift their hands upwards and run away]
Squidward: And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?
SpongeBob: Tuesday.
Squidward: Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.
SpongeBob: [gasps] But tonight's Tuesday night!
Squidward: Then he'll be coming.
SpongeBob: How will we know?
Squidward: There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First: the lights will flicker on and off. Next...
Harold: [interrupts] Dude, can I have some ketchup?
Squidward: Oh, here you go. [hands him ketchup] Next: the phone will ring and there will be nobody there. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails] And finally: the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails, starts eating his arms, the arms regrow and he eats those and then he eats his arms like popcorn] Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead! [SpongeBob begins eating his hands like popcorn] Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand...
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: He opens the door... [pushes his tentacle to SpongeBob's face, making it looking like he's a door that's being opened; while doing this he imitates the sound of a squeaky door opening. leans towards SpongeBob's face, which sinks in] ...he slowly approaches the counter! ["counter" echoes menacingly] And you know what he does next?
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: You really want to know?
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Are you sure you want to know?
SpongeBob: WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DOES HE DO?!?!
Squidward: [sneaks up on SpongeBob, taps him] He gets ya! [SpongeBob now screams repeatedly for about 20 seconds while Squidward is laughing] SpongeBob... [continues screaming] SpongeBob I wa... [screaming continues] I was ju... [SpongeBob's pupils are now screaming too] I was jus... [screaming continues] SPONGEBOB, I WAS JOKING!!
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: It's not true! None of it's true!
SpongeBob: It's not?
Squidward: Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.
SpongeBob: Ohhhhh... [laughs repeatedly like he did with screaming. Cuts into later in the night. Shows Krusty Krab with a big sign that says 'Open Forever']
[Squidward is shown at the counter reading a book. Squidward hears spooky noises and feels water dripping on him but he doesn't know what it is.]
SpongeBob: [on the ceiling wearing suction cups cleaning] Isn't this great, Squidward? [Squidward screams] There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.
Squidward: [says to himself] Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?
[cuts to Patrick's bedroom]
Patrick: [Patrick's alarm clock goes off] Oh, boy! Three A.M.! [whips out a Krabby Patty and starts to eat it; cuts back to The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here! [lights start to flicker on and off] Very funny, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: "And the lights will flicker on and off," just like the story. I get it. [realizes no one is flickering the light switch and looks shocked]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?
Squidward: I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day! [phone rings, Squidward picks it up] What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: [walks up to the counter] Nice try, Squidward.
Squidward: Nice try, what?
SpongeBob: "The phone will ring and there will be no one there." [raises eyebrows up and down and giggles] Oh, you crack me up.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm not doing this. [hangs up phone] Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights, [lights flicker on and off] and the phone, [phone rings] ...and the walls will ooze green slime?!?! [walls start to ooze green slime] Oh, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing? [hears a motor, turns his head and opens his eyes wide; a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab doors]
SpongeBob: [walks up to the counter] I didn't know the buses ran this late. 
Squidward: They don't! [a man gets out of the bus and the bus pulls away, all Squidward and SpongeBob can see is his spooky outline]
SpongeBob: Well, they're dropping someone off. [from the outside, the man lifts his spatula]
Squidward: [screams to the point where hair grows from his head and starts wiggling] The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...
SpongeBob: The Hash-Slinging Slasher! [starts to cry]
Squidward: At last you understand! We're doomed!
SpongeBob: No, that's not it. [wipes tear] I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me. You must really like me! [cries again]
Squidward: SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One: I hate you. And two: how can that be me when I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE!? [the man taps on the door with his spatula]
SpongeBob:  [screams to the point where his eyelashes grow and start wiggling]
SpongeBob and Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!!!! [the guy walks in the door and up to the counter]
SpongeBob: [Squidward screams] He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!
Squidward: SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!
SpongeBob: Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!
Squidward: Huh? [a nerdy unnamed guy reaches the counter]
SpongeBob: Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!
Richard: Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula. [holds up spatula] I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.
SpongeBob: Do you have references?
Squidward: Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights? [lights flicker on and off; SpongeBob, Squidward, and Richard look over to see a vampire flicking the light switch]
SpongeBob, Squidward and Richard: [playfully] Nosferatu!
Nosferatu: [smiles, light turns off]


[The exterior of the Krusty Krab is shown.]
Mr. Krabs: [Off-Screen] Da da dee. [Mr. Krabs is shown in his office. He is stitching.] Stitch one purl two. da da dee doo. [The scene shows that he is stitching a pattern of a dollar bill.] Da day dee da. Dee doh.. [He abruptly stops and sniffs the air.] What's that smell? [He runs over to the cashier boat.] The register! [He shakes the register and smells it.] $49.0... 8?! That's a penny short! [He starts crying.]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, no. Not a penny. Help! Somebody, help us.
[SpongeBob slides up from the floor of the boat.]
SpongeBob: It's just a penny, sir. [Mr. Krabs stops crying. SpongeBob jumps out of the boat.] It doesn't matter.
Mr. Krabs: Doesn't matter? It's money that makes the world go round, boy! It's money that keeps your [He holds up a right-angled ruler to SpongeBob's pants.] pants square! It's money that keeps Squidward in frilly soap!
[The scene cuts to Squidward in the Dining area sniffing the air.]
Squidward: Lilac!
[The scene cuts to show the Krusty Krab with numerous large bandages on it.]
Mr. Krabs: It's money that paid for all them renovations we did! Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that... [Something catches his eye] Hmm? ...scrumptious, curvy cutie.
SpongeBob: I see her, Mr. Krabs. [The scene cuts to a Krabby Patty on a tray, next to a soda.] A Krabby Patty with cheese. [A pair of flippers grabs the sandwich. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs.] The classic.
Mr. Krabs: Not the sandwich, boy. The curvy cutie holding the sandwich.
[The scene cuts to Mrs. Puff eating the Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] Hey! [On-Screen] that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!
Mr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff? Aw, she's married.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single.
Mr. Krabs: Then what happened to Mr. Puff?
[The scene cuts to Mr. Puff, who is now a lamp, being turned on. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: She doesn't like to talk about it.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a lass like that on me claw.
SpongeBob: Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, I, I'm, I'm too old, boy. Too hard-shelled for love. Besides, I ain't not properly dressed.
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Mr. Krabs! [The scene cuts to a close-up of his clothes, which are messy.] You look great. [The scene cuts back to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.] You wait here while I go break the ice.
[SpongeBob quickly runs off.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooh!
[It cuts to a wide shot of Mrs. Puff.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
[Mrs. Puff screams.]
Mrs. Puff: Hit the brakes, SpongeBob! Watch that tree! Left! Left!
SpongeBob: [He snaps his fingers.] Wait, Mrs. Puff! We're not driving.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't expect to see you here.
SpongeBob: I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss?
Mrs. Puff: Well, I'm not...
SpongeBob: Don't move!
[SpongeBob runs back to Mr. Krabs.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
SpongeBob: [While dragging Mr. Krabs to the table] Mrs. Puff, [The two stop.] I'd like to introduce you to Mr... [Mr. Krabs falls forward onto the floor. SpongeBob props him back up.] Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs.
Mrs. Puff: [Nervously] Uh, hello.
[Mr. Krabs quivers.]
SpongeBob: Psst! Mr. Krabs, say hello. [Mr. Krabs nervously mutters.] No, no, Mr. Krabs. Just say hello.
[Mr. Krabs performs a strangled groan.]
Mrs. Puff: Hmm, perhaps another time would be...
Mr. Krabs: [As Mrs. Puff is starting to leave, Mr. Krabs yelling at SpongeBob] No!
SpongeBob: Wait. [As Mrs. Puff sits back down and shivering] He's trying to tell you something.
Mrs. Puff: [Shivering] Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs jerks his eyes and moving his arms around weirdly, while speaking gibberish.] I don't understand.
[Mr. Krabs looks at SpongeBob and speaks gibberish to him.]
SpongeBob: [While Mr. Krabs is speaking gibberish] Oh! I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to... [Mr. Krabs stops speaking gibberish and turns around.] ...hit you with a rake!
Mrs. Puff: [Scared] Goodness!
Mr. Krabs: No!
[Mr. Krabs lifts his tall eyes up and down, while Speaking gibberish.]
SpongeBob: Try to guess your weight.
Mrs. Puff: [Offended] Well!
[Mr. Krabs flails his arms, while speaking gibberish.]
SpongeBob: [While Mr. Krabs is speaking gibberish] No, wait. He wants to take you... [thinks for a second] ...on a date!
[Mr. Krabs gasps happily and falls over]
Mrs. Puff: Is that true, Mr. Krabs? Do you want to take me on a date?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. What do you say?
Mrs. Puff: What do I say? [starts laughing] I say, you have a way with words, Mr. Krabs.
[Mrs. Puff walks away.]
Mr. Krabs: I still got it. [chuckles]
[The bubble transition goes to the exterior of the Krabs' house at night.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] Ready for your date, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [Off-screen] I'm always ready when it comes to datin', lad!
[The interior of the Krabs' Anchor is shown.]
SpongeBob: [While he is holding a list, and Mr. Krabs, who is wearing fancy clothes, walk down stairs] Breath spray?
Mr. Krabs: [sprays mouth with breath spray] Check.
SpongeBob: Lucky hanky?
Mr. Krabs: [He takes out his hanky.] Check.
SpongeBob: Giant rusty anchor?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, anchor. Anchor? I can't find me giant rusty anchor!
[SpongeBob throws the list away and laughs]
SpongeBob: Relax, Mr. Krabs. [While opening the door.] Just a little joke. [While making a circle in the air with his hands.] Good luck with you know who.
[SpongeBob moves his eyebrows up and down.]
Mr. Krabs: Who's that?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah. Well, wish me luck, lad!
[The bubble transition goes to the exterior of Fancy!]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen] Oh, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff are shown at a table inside.] This dinner has been so wonderful. The coral was cooked to perfection. [giggles] I don't think I could eat another bite.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I doubt that, my little shrimp boat.
[Mrs. Puff giggles.]
Mrs. Puff: You're spoiling me, Mr. Krabs. I mean, [The scene shows a squid rubbing Mrs. Puff's feet.] foot rubs between courses. [While pulling out a caricature of herself.] Caricatures. Imported music. [The scene swift pans to a live-action scuba diver plays the piano on the other side of the room. The scene shows Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing's too good for you, my prickly peach.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, what I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Krabs, is...
Waiter: Uh, sir, your fancy pantsy limousine is here.
Mr. Krabs: Wonderful! Pufflily-poo, your chariot awaits!
Mrs. Puff: Well...
[Mr. Krabs whistles and two men join the waiter in carrying a screaming Mrs. Puff away.]
Mr. Krabs: You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib.
[He sighs as the waiter approaches him again.]
Waiter: Your bill, sir.
[Mr. Krabs takes the bill.]
Mr. Krabs:  What? [it shows the bill] $100?! Well, this can't possibly be correct!
Waiter: Oh, my mistake, sir. Thank you for pointing that out. [he hands Mr. Krabs a different bill] This is your bill.
[Mr. Krabs takes the bill. Looks down and his eyes enlarge, oddly. The exterior of the restaurant is shown and the cork flies off. The scream shatters the glass bottle, which causes the sign to go flying and the valet fall over. The bubble transitions shows the Krabs' anchor at night. It then cuts to the interior and Mr. Krabs, who is back in his normal clothes, crying on the floor. SpongeBob is also there.]
SpongeBob: I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night?
[Mr. Krabs gets up.]
Mr. Krabs: [Still crying] Oh, SpongeBob! I couldn't help but spend every cent I had on her! I couldn't control myself!
SpongeBob: What are you gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know, boy! I've got another date tomorrow! I'm caught in the middle of me two great loves! Sweet Mrs. Puff, and the rest of me money!
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs is crying] I wish there was some way I could help.
[Mr. Krabs stops crying.]
Mr. Krabs: Perhaps there is, boy! [hands SpongeBob his wallet] I'm puttin' you in charge of me money.
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You come with me on the date and don't let me spend any money. [The bubble transition shows Mrs. Puff's house. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk up to it.] Now remember, we keep it cheap by going to the park. And no matter how much I ask you, you don't give me any of me money. Now give me a dollar.
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Good boy! You'll do fine.
[Mr. Krabs knocks on the door.]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen; singingly] Who is it?
Mr. Krabs: It's me, [Mr. Krabs' pupils turn into hearts.] my beautiful bell buoy!
[Mrs. Puff is heard giggling.]
Mrs. Puff: Just a minute!
[Mr. Krabs pupils turn back to normal.]
Mr. Krabs: Flowers! Flowers, boy! Go get flowers!
SpongeBob: But you said...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't call on a classy lady like Mrs. Puff empty-handed. We ain't talking about this... [He makes a square in the air.] ...or this... [He makes a triangle in the air.] ...we're talking about this!
[Mr. Krabs makes the circle in the air.]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen] Almost ready.
Mr. Krabs: Hurry, boy! Get the flowers!
[SpongeBob runs off as Mrs. Puff opens her door.]
Mr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff. You're as beautiful as ever.
[Mrs. Puff sighs.]
Mrs. Puff: That's funny. I thought I heard SpongeBob's voice.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, e-excuse me. I have to call my insurance agent.
[Mrs. Puff hurries back inside]
Mr. Krabs: Of course, my beautiful Puff.
[Mr. Krabs sighs and his pupils turn to hearts again.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen; making the heart pupils go away] Mr. Krabs, [While walking to give Mr. Krabs the flowers.] I got the flowers you wanted me to buy.
Mr. Krabs: [While turning around.] What's that?
SpongeBob: I got the flowers for Mrs. Puff.
Mr. Krabs: We had an agreement, boy. You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!
SpongeBob: But you said...
Mrs. Puff: [As Mr. Krabs' pupils turn to hearts again] Here I come!
Mr. Krabs: [while Mrs. Puff opens the door and he grabs the flowers] For you, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, [as she is grabbing the flowers] flowers. Oh, how thoughtful!
Mr. Krabs: [While he holds out an empty claw] And here's a box of chocolates. [He turns back to SpongeBob.] SpongeBob, where's the chocolates?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't go to Mrs. Puff's house without chocolates. Hurry! Hurry!
[SpongeBob runs off. SpongeBob comes back with the heart-shaped box of chocolates]
SpongeBob: [As Mr. Krabs' pupil return to normal] I bought the biggest box they had!
Mr. Krabs: Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!
Mrs. Puff: [As Mr. Krabs' pupils turn back into hearts] Oh, Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: [As he offer Mrs. Puff the box of chocolates] Here's those chocolates I bought for you. What are we doing today, Mrs. Puff? Dinner? Dancing? A trip to the moon?
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs' eyes turn back to normal] Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?
Mrs. Puff: Actually, a walk in the park sounds perfect. It's a beautiful day. I'll just need to get a sun hat and...
Mr. Krabs: [While his pupils turn back into hearts] Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, I think she...
Mr. Krabs: The sun is beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head.
SpongeBob: As your financial advisor, I suggest...
Mr. Krabs: [his eyes are back to normal] There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!
[SpongeBob starts to leave, but comes back.]
SpongeBob: But...
Mr. Krabs: Today! [SpongeBob runs off and Mrs. Puff puts her fins over her mouth.] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll [He takes out a barrel.] shade ya! [He places the barrel on Mrs. Puff's head.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, hurry!
SpongeBob: [as he comes back from the store with a large straw hat] One shady hat.
Mr. Krabs: Good job, lad. 
[Mr. Krabs puts the hat on Mrs. Puff.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, well, thank you, but you didn't need to buy one. I have a hat in the closet.
Mr. Krabs: Didn't need to buy one? [He turns his head around like an owl to face SpongeBob, still grinning] You hear that, boy? [in high pitch] We didn't need to buy a hat. [angrily] Aren't you supposed to be saving me money?!
SpongeBob: I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!
Narrator: A few moments later...
Mr. Krabs: [happily as hearts float in the background] SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat! [After SpongeBob buys one, Krabs is mad and flaming dollars float in the background]
Mr. Krabs: You're spending all me money! [happily] Puffy needs a new pair of shoes! [SpongeBob gets the shoes]
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] You're breaking me, boy! [happily] She needs fine jewelry! [SpongeBob gets the jewelry] Not that fine! [SpongeBob runs back and forth, speeding up, carrying various items as Mr. Krabs keeps yelling his name. He eventually becomes too tired to move] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a pink umbrella] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a bicycle] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a purple surfboard] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a grandfather clock] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with an anchor barbell] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a TV] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back and forth with lots of presents] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
[his voice echoes, and SpongeBob is seen sitting on the ground, his arms stretched, and he is panting]
Mr. Krabs: [runs up, his eyes are shaped like hearts] SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff...
SpongeBob: Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say, [stretches out his eyeballs, imitating Mr. Krabs] "Arrgh, SpongeBob! Yer spending all me money!" And then I'll say, "But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!" Then you'll say, "We're not talking about this..." [Makes the triangle] ..."Or this"... [Makes the square] ..."we're talking about this!" [He squiggles all over the screen. The screen fades out for a moment. Fades back in to see SpongeBob panting with Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: But, lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this! [Cut to Mrs. Puff who has many unneeded, expensive items surrounding her]
Mrs. Puff: Are we going to the park soon?
Mr. Krabs: Please, lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her! [Starts to cry]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Okay, I, I'm going to get it, see? [Walks off-screen, and comes back with a washing machine] Cheer up, Mr. Krabs, Here's that washing machine you wanted.
Mr. Krabs: Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!
SpongeBob: See?! You just did it again!
Mr. Krabs: Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money. [SpongeBob gets a blank expression on his face] Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think? [screams] Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet! [During SpongeBob's rage, Mrs. Puff looks up these words in the dictionary that Mr. Krabs bought her, and gasps and blushes. SpongeBob angrily walks past Mrs. Puff while muttering, and Mr. Krabs' mouth is agape]
Mrs. Puff: I didn't know SpongeBob had such a colorful vocabulary. Actually, there's something I'd like to say, too, Mr. Krabs. [Takes off her fur coat, shoes and hat] I'm afraid I just don't feel comfortable accepting all these gifts. I'd rather go Dutch, if you don't mind. [Hands him some money from her purse]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, okay.
Mrs. Puff: You're a very sweet man, Mr. Krabs. [Mrs. Puff kisses him and his eyes bend into the shape of a heart]
Mr. Krabs: [as his eyes make a heart] Aawww...


Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. [class groans]
SpongeBob: [leans towards Nat] Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
Mrs. Puff: Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight. [class groans again]
SpongeBob: [Again leaning towards Nat] Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
Mrs. Puff: In no less than 800 words. [squeals and class groans again]
Nat: [acting like SpongeBob] Did you hear that? 800 words!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I know! [Nat frowns]
Mrs. Puff: Due tomorrow. And remember class: work hard and no goofing off.
[back at SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is [holds up a pencil] the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm... funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. [kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it] Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. [looks at window, it's colorful outside] Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! [SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and has still only written 8 words] Gee, this is harder than I thought... [SpongeBob looks outside where everyone is having fun]
Patrick: [applies lotion on Sandy] Come on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob goes back to his desk]
SpongeBob: It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! [a live-action drag race is shown. a car hits a wall, tumbles and gets back up] Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only 6 o'clock. Okay, okay here we go, here we go. [struggles to write] I know, I just need to get blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? [SpongeBob does calisthenics. While doing it, he recites "Hup Hoo" several times, his nose and eyelashes do it too.]
SpongeBob:  I can feel those juices pumpin' now! [moves his chair closer to the table. he does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs] Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! [pushes his chair in] Come on, pencil, make words.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How’s my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What do you mean you're not hungry?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary. [Grabs Gary by his shell and pours some food he takes up a ladder and fills it to ceiling-level] I've got to make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite. [Gary quickly eats it] Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? [steps on Gary's food] Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. [cleans it up using himself as a mop] Hmmm... I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. [cut to SpongeBob, who has already finished] Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long... and it's only... 10 o'clock?! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written! [Begins active writing] I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah... yeah... yeah! And some of these, and some of these... Almost there and... [finishes writing. The pencil is steaming due to the excess force] done. Now lets see how it looks so far. "The-" [shows he has only written "the" in fancy lettering] Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go... thinks SpongeBob think! [looks at the telephone. Cut to Patrick in bed, snoring. The phone rings and he wakes up]
Patrick: Who is that? [picks up phone] Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to?
Patrick: Sleeping.
SpongeBob: That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss? I remember on the...
Patrick: SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.
SpongeBob: [gasps] That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!
Patrick: Well, I'm listening.
SpongeBob: Uh... Marco!
Patrick: Polo! [hangs up]
SpongeBob: Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write? [hangs up phone] Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? [back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! [swats the shavings away but they float above the paper] Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long, pesky particles! [the shavings float back to SpongeBob. As he struggles to remove the shavings, he swallows one in the process] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What do you mean 'overly dramatic', Gary? [rubs his tummy] All that choking sure made me hungry.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary. I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see... White or rye bread... or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese [doorbell rings] A visitor? For me!? [SpongeBob opens the door to meet Norton the Mailfish] Hello! 
Norton: Package for Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Great thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?
Norton: It puts bread on the table.
SpongeBob: Rye or pumpernickel? [laughs]
Norton: Oh, brother..
SpongeBob: So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...
Norton: Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away]
SpongeBob: [Gulps and zooms in on his face] How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? [blipping his eyes and slides back into his house]
Johnny Elaine: In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off. [head sticks out TV] When will he learn?
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [karate chops the TV causing a zap and glass breaking. lights a candle]
Chair: Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat, put your feet up and relax.
SpongeBob: [gasps and a bell rings and drops the candle that went out and the clock lights up] Oh no! Midnight! [runs through the hallway of clocks and the alarms ring on the walls] Must... get... back to desk! [runs to the table, but it has enlarged. he jumps up on the chair] Whew, that was a close call. [his pants are missing] Ah! My pants!
Pants: Yoo hoo! Down here!
SpongeBob: You get up here! I've got to get back to work!
Pants: [runs out of SpongeBob's Pineapple to the door] Freedom!
SpongeBob: [runs out the door] Stop Pants, you get back here this instant! Paaants... [door closes, SpongeBob yelps, then tries to get back in, but it is locked. looks in the window. The candle is still lighting. The clock spins, breaks, and comes to life]
Clock: [ghostly voice] Time's up, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [gasps as the candle comes to life]
Fire Wick: Only 799 words to go! [laughs sinisterly as he burns the essay]
SpongeBob: No! [the fire wick burns his entire pineapple. He screams] What have I done?! [SpongeBob runs around his house, yelling] Help! Help! My house is on fire! [continues running around his burning house until it comes to life]
House: SpongeBob, why? Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob? Why didn't you just write your essay? Stop wasting time!
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Where's my essay! Oh, there you are! [laughs] I must have dozed off. [grabs his paper from his head] Lets see where are we? [holding his paper with a word "The" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk] Do I dare look at the clock... [slowly looks at the clock and gasps] It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes? How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight! [Writing] And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... [cut to SpongeBob running to the boating school] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is! [goes inside, but nobody is there] Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?
Mrs. Puff: Oh, there you are SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em.
Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you... I have to go to a teacher's convention!
SpongeBob: But what about my essay?
Mrs. Puff: I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!
[SpongeBob rips his essay. He then rips himself]


[The title card has men singing part of the song "Sailing Over the Dogger Bank"] ♪Watcha twigger she's a proper jubby-jewel... On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby!♪ [then we see the Krusty Krab at night]
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's the worst time of the day once again. [cringes as he changes the "Open" sign to "Closed"] Closing time!
SpongeBob: Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, SpongeBob! [pulls SpongeBob back] Take that pile of filth out with you. [Squidward holds up a trash bag with flies flying around it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!
Squidward: He means this filth, you loon! [He drops the bag on the floor]
[SpongeBob goes to the dumpster while bringing the trash bag]
SpongeBob: [singing] Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash.
[SpongeBob throws the trash in the dumpster and then looks at some writings on the dumpster.]
SpongeBob: Hmm... dumpster writing! The voice of the people! "Up with bubbles, down with air!" [laughs] "Nematodes are people too!" [laughs] Ha, those nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells. [writes the word "good" after "smells"] Good. [laughs] Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a [dolphin chirp].
Garbage man: [Clearly disgusted] Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
[picks up multiple garbage bags and leaves]
SpongeBob: Well, sometimes, but not... Recently.
Patrick: [off-screen] Hi, garbage man. [appears on-screen] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?
Patrick: "Krabs..." Uh, isn't that the red, sweaty guy you work for?
SpongeBob: [pointing to "Krabs," then the unseen word as they are said] Nah-uh, not that word, that word.
Patrick: Hmm... [dolphin chirp]! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.
SpongeBob: Sentence enhancers?
Patrick: You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-O! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it! Let me try. [clears his throat] Hello, Patrick. Lovely [dolphin chirp] day we're having, isn't it?
Patrick: Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This [dolphin chirp] day is particularly [dolphin chirp] lovely!
SpongeBob: How [dolphin chirp] right you are, Patrick!
[The two continue to say the word a few more times]
SpongeBob: Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation.
Patrick: Oh, mine, too!
[both laugh]
SpongeBob: It tingles when I laugh!
[SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab the next day]
SpongeBob: Hello, customers, nice [dolphin chirp] day we're having, uh? [The customers stop eating and stare in shock]
Harold: [gasps] Did he just say?!
Pirate fish: Aye, he did.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?
Patrick: [sitting at table at the Krusty Krab] Pretty [dolphin chirp] good, SpongeBob.
Old Man Jenkins: I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.
SpongeBob: [taps on the microphone and speaks into it] Attention, customers, today's special is a [dolphin chirp] Krabby Patty served in a greasy [dolphin chirp] sauce and grilled to [dolphin chirp] perfection. [a mother octopus covers her laughing children's ears and puts soda on one since she doesn't have enough hands] And don't forget to ask us to [dolphin chirp] the [dolphin chirp] fries. It will be our [dolphin chirp] pleasure. [Squidward hears the intercom and a giant human ear pops out of his head; he pushes it back in] Hi, Squidward, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?
Patrick: Nice [dolphin chirp] day, isn't it, Squidward?
Tom: I don't understand. That guy's talented, he doesn't have to work blue.
Evelyn: Let's go somewhere more family oriented. [Everyone leaves the Krusty Krab, grumbling in frustration]
Female fish: [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] I'm never eating here again.
Male fish: [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] Those foul-mouth bottom feeders.
[The Krusty Krab customer meter is running down; sirens wail and a red light flashes]
Mr. Krabs: [in the bathroom, hears the sirens] Huh? [looks through the periscope, sees that the Krusty Krab is empty and gasps] The Krusty Krab, she's empty! [runs to dining room with toilet paper stuck to one of his legs] All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?
Squidward: Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what was it? What'd he say?
Squidward: Er...he said...um, well he said...
[Squidward whispers]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Squidward whispers it again; Mr. Krabs gasps] SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.
Patrick: Yeah, it's fancy talk.
Mr. Krabs: There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
SpongeBob: You mean [dolphin chirp]?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, that one! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand up] Now quit saying that! [SpongeBob and Patrick frown] It's a bad word!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bad word?! [both start wiping their tongues while moaning]
Mr. Krabs: Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.
Squidward: Don't you mean there are only 7?
Mr. Krabs: Not if you're a sailor. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wow, 13.
Patrick: That's a lot of [dolphin chirp] bad words.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We promise.
[later at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing Eels and Escalators]
SpongeBob: Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!
Patrick: Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.
SpongeBob: Yeah, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators.
Patrick: Oh, boy, my favorite! [Flops arms up and down like a seal]
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! [rolls the dice]
Patrick: Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel.
SpongeBob: Darn. [moves game piece to eel]
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Hooray! Escalators! Yay! [screams] Up, up, up!
SpongeBob: Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators! [rolls dice] [sighs] Eels again.
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Escalators!
SpongeBob: Escalators, Escalators, Escalators! [throws dice] Eels?
Patrick: [rolls dice] Es-skee-lators! [moves to escalators] Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!
SpongeBob: [gets frustrated while rolling the dice] Escalators, escalators, escalators! [dice is thrown and lands on escalators] Ha! Escalators! [dice turn over to eels]
Patrick: Eels...
SpongeBob: Ah, [dolphin chirp]! [covers his mouth when he realizes his mistake]
Patrick: Ooooh...! You said number 11!
SpongeBob: [babbles for Patrick to understand] I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob, I understand. [pause] Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [starts running to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [starts running after him] No, wait, Patrick! [after SpongeBob catches up to Patrick] Patrick, no, please don't tell!
Patrick: But, you said "[dolphin chirp]"! [Covers his mouth as he realizes his mistake]
SpongeBob: Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!
Patrick: Not if I tell first!
SpongeBob: I can run faster than you! [laughs]
Patrick: [riding on the back of an ice cream truck] See ya at the Krusty Krab! Hahaha! [the truck turns at the wrong corner] Oh, nooooo!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What, what, what?
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes, yes?
SpongeBob: He said, he said, he said!
Mr. Krabs: Out with it, boy!
SpongeBob: [talking fast] Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things.
Mr. Krabs: [eyes SpongeBob] What kind of things?
SpongeBob: Well, he said...
Mr. Krabs: Yes?!
SpongeBob: Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?
Patrick: [walks in door of the Krusty Krab and eats an ice cream cone, but throws away the cone] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs sighs]
SpongeBob and Patrick: He said that word that you said we shouldn't say...!
SpongeBob: ...number thirteen...
[They babble on about the word, as Mr. Krabs stares on disapprovingly, until the two are just pointing at each other and yelling, "Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!"; Mr. Krabs eventually grabs their lips to quiet them.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mmm-mmm...!
Mr. Krabs: Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mmm-hmm... [Mr. Krabs lets go of their lips, which initially deflate, then reinflate; they both point at each other again] He said "[dolphin chirp]"!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash. [picks SpongeBob and Patrick up by their pants and carries them outside the Krusty Krab] You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. [walks back in Krusty Krab]
Patrick: What's going to happen to us?
SpongeBob: We'll probably get 40 lashes!
Patrick: Oh, no! [stupidly imagines himself blinking with 40 thick eyelashes]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.
Patrick: I'm sorry, too, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Agreed!
Mr. Krabs: All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for fouling the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom. [jams his foot on a rock then hops on one leg] Ow, Ooh! Ow! My [dolphin chirps] foot! What [dolphin chirps] genius put a [dolphin chirps] rock in a [dolphin chirps] path?! Can't you see I got a [boat horn no. 1] foot here?! Oh! [seal bark. Continues saying a bunch of swear words, censored out by seagulls, foghorns, ship bells, etc.; at this moment, SpongeBob and Patrick count the swear words he uses]
SpongeBob: Five, six, seven...
Mr. Krabs: ...a whole lotta [old-style foghorn] and with a side of [dolphin chirp], a heapin' helpin' of [ship's bell] and a boatload of [boat horn no. 4] ...
Patrick: Nine...
Mr. Krabs:  Ooh [seal bark, seagull squak]crabbin’ [a new-style foghorn] Ooh-hoo-uh! [cries in pain]
SpongeBob: [cuts to SpongeBob with thirteen fingers] That's all thirteen, Patrick! [gasps] We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [worried] No, please, not me mommy! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as they run to Mama Krabs' house, Mr. Krabs runs after them] Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!
[They go to the house]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [repeatedly banging on the door] Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!
Mama Krabs: Why, hello there!
[SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs all explain the situation at the same time, swearing numerous times as they do so]
SpongeBob: Mama Krabs, he said [dolphin chirp] and then he said [dolphin chirps] again and said [dolphin chirps] and then he screamed at the top of his voice [foghorn blows]!
Patrick: It was terrible.
SpongeBob: And he-- [horn honks]--Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of [seagull caws, foghorn, ship's bell] I have never heard in my days!
Mama Krabs: [shocked] Oh, dear! My poor old heart. [faints]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you? [takes a coin out of her pocket] You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!
Mama Krabs: [wakes up] You should all be ashamed. And if you're going to talk like sailors, then you're going to work like sailors.
[Then the three are painting her house; Patrick is painting the sand]
Mama Krabs: I guess you scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade. [laughs, then stubs her foot on a rock] Yeeeoww! My [Klaxon horn] foot!
[SpongeBob and Patrick gasp in shock] 
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] Mother!
Mama Krabs: What? It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy.
Old Man Jenkins: [driving by] Howdy, Mrs. K! [honks the horn]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Mama Krabs: [all laugh together]


Squidward: Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image. [wife's head turns into Squidward's and the husband notices] I'll go down in history. Someday, there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!
Janitor: Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.
Squidward: Uncultured trash urchin. 9 A.M. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer! [opens door] Welcome to art class!!
Nat: Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry... [everyone leaves except SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?
Squidward: SpongeBob!? In art class? WAIT! THIS IS COOKING! COME BACK! You gotta be kidding!
SpongeBob: [laughs] This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?
Squidward: You're looking at him.
SpongeBob: You... are the teacher? To my pupil?! This isn't art class, it's Heaven.
Squidward: Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.
Squidward: So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, please.
Squidward: Well, art is not all fun and games. [as he picks up a big stack of books] It's a lot of hard... [he drops the stack, which makes SpongeBob's desk hop in the air] ...work. Okay. First, repeat after me: "I have no talent."
SpongeBob: I have no talent.
Squidward: "Mr. Tentacles has all the talent."
SpongeBob: Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
Squidward: "If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacle's talent may rub off on me."
SpongeBob: If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art. [smiles. The scene cuts to Squidward with a sad look on his face, the camera cuts back to SpongeBob and he is still smiling, the camera again cuts back to Squidward]
Squidward: Whatever. Okay. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say [draws a crooked circle] circle one. [laughs] Am I going too fast for you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: How's this, Squidward?
Squidward: What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.
SpongeBob: Well, first I draw this head. [draws an amazing head] Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.
Squidward: Gimme that. [crumples paper] Forget the circles.
SpongeBob: Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try. [laughs] Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog! That's you on the bottom.
Squidward: Gimme that. [rips up paper] There is nothing artistic about leapfrog! [SpongeBob puts pieces together] What are you doing, now?
SpongeBob: I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped up paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time... [blows paper]
Squidward: Do you want to learn art, or not?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.
Squidward: Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. Then, gently... [hits marble with chisel; and it breaks into a pile of rubble]
SpongeBob: [hits marble with chisel and it becomes a perfect sculpture of Michelangelo's David] How's this Squidward?
Squidward: [starry-eyed] It's beautiful. [a tear falls from his eyes] I mean... this isn't a sculpture. [SpongeBob's lip starts quivering] A good sculpture takes... more time! You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules. [SpongeBob wipes away a tear] Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong. [Squidward puts a nose like his on the sculpture] There, now it's art.
SpongeBob: Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons. [falls down and starts crying] I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence. [crawls over to the front door and looks back at Squidward] I don't even deserve to use your doors! [the doors open, hitting SpongeBob out the window into the garbage dumpster head-first]
Monty: Hello, there!
SpongeBob: But I did deserve that. [the dumpster closes on top of him] I deserved that, too. [garbage man takes SpongeBob to dump] And I deserve this!
Monty: Good day, sir!
Squidward: Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.
Monty: Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags.
Squidward: The world famous art collector?
Monty: The one and only.
Squidward: Well, what are you doing here?
Monty: I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.
Squidward: Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: "Squidward en repose".
Monty: I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection.
Squidward: Why not?
Monty: Because. It's an art collection! [laughs]
Squidward: How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.
Monty: More like: Belongs in the Trash! [laughs]
Janitor: Sorry. I must've missed that one. [grabs the painting and throws it in the trash]
Monty: Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?!
Squidward: Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...
Monty: Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship! This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw. [removes the nose Squidward added on and it lands on Squidward's head] Ahh, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame...
Squidward: Fame! [Squidward imagines himself as popular]
Monty: ...fortune...
Squidward: Fortune! [Squidward imagines himself in a tub full of money]
Monty: ...anything his heart desires!
Squidward: Anything?!?! [Squidward imagines himself with hair] It's me! It's me! I'm responsible!
Monty: I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal! Now, uh, help me get this in the car.
Squidward: I could use a little help. [sculptures head falls off and turns into dust] My fame! My fortune! My hair!
Monty: Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one.
Squidward: Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.
Monty: Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks. [laughs]
Squidward: Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. [closes the door as Monty walks out] I gotta find SpongeBob! [at dump] SpongeBob...SpongeBob?! SpongeBob!?
SpongeBob: Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.
Squidward: Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.
SpongeBob: Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame. [he slides out of the cereal box] These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy! I can't look at them. [SpongeBob's hands pop off and run into a soup can]
Squidward: Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really!
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really!
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really.
SpongeBob: Wow... [pause] Really?
Squidward: Let's go.
SpongeBob: [notices a painting in the dump] Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!
Squidward: Gimme that. [back at classroom] Okay, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before.
SpongeBob: I... can't!
Squidward: Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again!
SpongeBob: I did it, Squidward. [draws a crooked circle]
Squidward: Huh!? But-but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the...?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book.
Squidward: Uhh... [crumples paper] How about this, huh? Remember?
SpongeBob: That's not in the book, either.
Squidward: FORGET ABOUT THE BOOK!!! [grips the book and rips it] Ha! Look at all this mess, SpongeBob! [he grabs a chair, puts it in front of SpongeBob's desk, and jumps up and down while holding it] What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do!?
SpongeBob: Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it! [puts book back together] There we go! Yeah!! Ta-da! [Squidward's nose melts off his face]
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.
SpongeBob: First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.
Squidward: Now you've got it.
SpongeBob: I've gotta embrace the marble!
Squidward: Right.
SpongeBob: I've gotta sniff the marble!
Squidward: Well, uh, okay.
SpongeBob: I've gotta lick the marble!
Squidward: Uhh...
SpongeBob: [washes the marble in a washing machine] I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble! [expands himself so that he's the same size as the marble] I'VE GOTTA BE THE MARBLE! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
Squidward: Here you go, buddy. [hands him sculpting tools]
SpongeBob: With this tool, I shall give birth... to art!
Squidward: Oh, boy... [SpongeBob taps marble with the chisel; it shatters into a pile of rubble]
SpongeBob: But, one more thing. [puts a stone nose shaped like Squidward's on it] There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in. [Squidward shrieks with frustration and goes crazy, runs through the marble and kicks two marbles, eating a part of the marble, he takes paint, squeezes it, kicks a picture, destroys the marble into 4 pieces and destroys the other marbles] It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump. [runs through the wall and down the road singing in the tune of the William Tell Overture] ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump.♪
Monty: I'm here for the... what the? Who is responsible for this?!
Squidward: As of now, it's his responsibility. [puts hat on janitor's head] Good day to you, sir! [this is a reference to "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory", where Mr. Wonka tells Charlie and Grandpa Joe that they lost the contest by saying: "You get NOTHING!!! You lose! GOOD DAY, SIR!"]
[It is revealed that when Squidward smashed all of the marble together, he created an even better sculpture than the first one and left without even seeing it]
Monty: [to janitor] You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!


[A jellyfish flies in the sky.]
French Narrator: Ahh, another beautiful day in Bikini Bottom's own Jellyfish Fields. An untamed world of natural order where the little jellyfish jellies roam free across the salty seascape. And where there is jellyfish, there is the Jellyfish Hunter.
SpongeBob: La la la la, la la la la la! [SpongeBob catches it] You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you "Twelvey." [tickles it with a feather] Coochie coochie coo! [it sneezes out some jelly] Bye, Twelvey! [Twelvey stings him as it says goodbye and flies away. He sees a blue jellyfish] Oh! It's you! [He mimics the jellyfish's style of floating, then tries to catch the blue jellyfish, but fails] Well, it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name.
No Name: [buzzes] [caption reads: "Bring it on!"]
SpongeBob:  [yells battle cries and tries to catch it. He runs. He steps on a soda can. He then runs so fast he flies like a rocket] Gotcha! [he is unsuccessful at catching it] ...Barnacles, how'd he do that? Someday, I'll catch old No Name.
[cut to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You've got 5 minutes!
SpongeBob: Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch! [he imitates a rocket launching and lifts his bag into the air] [a jar of jelly and a Krabby Patty fall out of the bag. He puts the jelly on the Krabby Patty and starts eating it.] Yum! [makes sounds, moans]
Fred: [Looks behind and stares at SpongeBob in confusion.] Hey, buddy! What the heck is that?
SpongeBob: Why, this is a hole, good sir. You see, I am a sponge, And we typically...
Fred: Not that! [points to SpongeBob's jelly patty] That!
SpongeBob: It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly.
Fred: Could I try some?
SpongeBob: Sure! [gives Fred some jellyfish jelly into his Krabby Patty]
Fred: [Eats the Krabby Patty with jellyfish jelly] Amazing... I've got to tell someone about this! ♪Hey all you people! Hey all you people! Hey all you people, won't you listen to meeeeeee... I just had a sandwich, no ordinary sandwich, a sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly! Hey, man, you've got to try this sandwich, it's no ordinary sandwich, it's the tastiest sandwich in the sea. Ah de ba da ba doo ba da ba de ba da da. Yeahhhhh... [The other Krusty Krab customers applaud him.] Thank you!♪
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?
SpongeBob: No one, Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers. [Showing some fish eating jelly patties happily. Shows love hearts and extremely satisfied customers.] Here you go, Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey.
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs the patty suspiciously] Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!
Fred: Sir, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten! I'm going to come back here for lunch everyday for the rest of my life! [A bill with Fred appears in it] Hey, buddy, you alright?
Mr. Krabs: [speechless, mutters incoherently]
SpongeBob: You okay, Mr. K?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!
Mr. Krabs: Well, keep dreaming. [Mr. Krabs gives him a jellyfish net] This'll be on your time.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Krabs: Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it [SpongeBob holds up a jellyfish in a jar] ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish.
SpongeBob: But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers. [Mr Krabs starts dramatizing depressing emotions] Oh, no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!
SpongeBob:  [gasps] No! Never!
Mr. Krabs: [optimistically] Then go out there and get me some more jellies!
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs:  [sinisterly, to himself] Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet! [chuckles]
SpongeBob: [jellyfishing with many nets. He then shows up with three jars] Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [painting a sign saying "Home of the Jelly Patty"] I'm gonna need more than that, boy.
SpongeBob: [cuts a rope. Many jellyfish are inside it. He shows up with five jars] More jellies, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [painting jellyfish on the walls of the Krusty Krab with the words "I Love Jellyfish" on his shirt] Oh, that'll never do. More!
[SpongeBob has a mustache on. A sign next to a jellyfish hive reading "FOR RENT" is shown. Jellyfish come in. They are trapped in a large net]
Mr. Krabs: [customers are lined up] More, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob is driving a large replica of himself. Its hand shows up at the Krusty Krab with a jar full of jellyfish]
Mr. Krabs: What don't you understand about... more?!
[Many SpongeBobs catch jellyfish]
Mr. Krabs: More! [SpongeBob catches two jellyfish with a net] More! [SpongeBob catches a jellyfish with a jar] More! [SpongeBob catches some jellyfish with a net while jumping leftwards to the screen] More! [SpongeBob tries to catch some jellyfish with a net by jumping rightwards to the screen] More... [SpongeBob manages to catch some more jellyfish with a net by jumping leftwards to the screen. Mr. Krabs now appears as a hideous caricature, popularly known as "Moar Krabs."] MOAR. [SpongeBob's catching goes wildly fast. Mr. Krabs now appears normal, but continually appearing] MOAR, MOAR, MOAR, MOAR. MOAR, MOAR. MOAR! [Cut to night. A sign reading "Jellyfish Fields. Pop. 0" is seen. "4 Million" is crossed out]
SpongeBob: Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!
[No Name secretly follows him]
SpongeBob: It feels like somebody... WANTS TO SELL ME SOMETHING! [Turns around and sees nobody]
Businessman: [hiding behind rock with another businessman] I told you he was on to us.
SpongeBob: [running away] I'm not interested in anything you're selling! [opens the door to his house and gets in as he looks out the window] I sure felt like... [laughs] I must be working too hard. [telephone rings] I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?
No Name: [breathing]
SpongeBob: [laughing nervously] Wrong number. [No Name has pliers and cuts the living room fuse and the lights go out. SpongeBob laughs nervously] I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill! [door opens and a small, black figure comes in] Gary, is that you? Gary? [the figure goes inside the kitchen] Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen. [light shines on a Krabby Patty with blue jellyfish jelly] Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly. [gasps] Blue jelly?! [No Name shows up] Hey, old No Name? What's happening?
No Name: [buzzing, shows a net and jar]
SpongeBob: [inside the jar] No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business? [No Name shows a factory] Hey, I don't remember that factory! [No Name shows him the inside] Huh? [Jellyfish are inside tubes. They are being sucked of their jelly. The dried out ones are put in trash cans. SpongeBob gasps] What is this horrible place? [a robot is tickling a jellyfish]
Robot: Coochie coochie coo. [jellyfish sneezes the jelly out and dries up]
SpongeBob: What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?
[Mr. Krabs is riding on an exercycle. It turns out that he's the monster who's responsible for this when SpongeBob caught the jellyfish of the fields]
Mr. Krabs: That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do?
[Mr. Krabs is shown wearing headphones and listening to an upbeat pop tune] 
Singer in the recording: ♪Give it all you got! Dance, dance, dance, get on it! Take it to the top...♪
SpongeBob: [breaks in, riding on No Name] Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!
Mr. Krabs: Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! A tea party! [No Name taps him] You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!
Mr. Krabs: Easy, boy, what are you doing with that?
SpongeBob: [holding an alligator wrench]  Something that should've been done a LONG TIME AGO!
Mr. Krabs: NOO!
SpongeBob: The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!
Mr. Krabs: [relieved] Whew!
SpongeBob: And now, I'm gonna set these jellyfish free! [tries to open it, but is unsuccessful]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say "open"! [Mr. Krabs realizes what he just said, and he covers his mouth, but it's too late. The sign on the door lights the words "OPEN" and the jellyfish escape.]
SpongeBob: Freedom! FREEDOM!!!
Mr. Krabs: YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME!!!! [He tries to pedal away as he laughs madly, then he looks down.] What?!
[Mr. Krabs sees that pedaling away didn't work, meaning that the excercycle never left the floor, and it remained intact on the floor, namely that an exercycle is meant for working out on it. The scene cuts to the jellyfish just right behind him, hovering over Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Blasted exercise craze...
[The jellyfish sting Mr. Krabs and he screams in pain. The jellyfish escape out the doors, possibly back to Jellyfish Fields.]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, friends!
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the factory and is incredibly burned] I'm taking jelly off the menu. [leaves]
SpongeBob: He really got burned on that deal! [laughs] All is as it should be. [brings out his jellyfish net] I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever! [No Name floats in SpongeBob's net. He gasps] Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... "Friend." [reaches his arm out. No Name does, but accidentally stings SpongeBob. He nervously smiles]


[Scene begins outside of the Fast Food Coliseum.]
Johnny: Welcome, sports fans, to the 21st annual Bikini Bottom Fry Cook Games.
[Horns are played as Harold the blue spotted fish runs into the stadium, holding a small torch. He runs up the stairs to a huge hamburger.]
Harold: I declare these Fry Cook Games... open!
[A gust of wind blows by and puts out the flame on the torch. The scene cuts to the "Please Stand By" screen. The screen cuts back to the stadium as the horns blow again and Harold runs back into the stadium, but this time, he is shielding the torch with his hand and panting. He runs back up the stairs to the huge hamburger.]
Harold: I declare these Fry Cook Games... open! [He lights the huge hamburger, then a second later, he starts being on fire]
Johnny: So begin the 21st Fry Cook Games. I'm a realistic Fish Head, and it's a beautiful day here at Bikini Bottom's Fast Food Coliseum.
[A clip plays showing a woman tossing a large straw into a large plastic cup]
Johnny: They come from everywhere microwaves hum.
[A clip of a man throwing an uncooked patty onto a grill]
Johnny: Patties sizzle.
[A clip of a fish bouncing on top of a large cube of gelatin and landing on a mat is shown]
Johnny: And heat lamps keep the fast food spirit warm... and soggy. But the real story is the bitter rivalry between former competitors Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab and Plankton of the Chum Bucket.
[Pictures of both Mr. Krabs and Plankton appear. A clip of Mr. Krabs lifting up two barrels of pickles is shown]
Johnny: Who could forget the year Mr. Krabs won gold for this five hundred pickle clean-and-jerk?
[Mr. Krabs is shown on a podium on the number one step, while Plankton is below him on the second]
Johnny: Not Plankton.
[Plankton sprays Mr. Krabs with a hose. A clip of Plankton flipping around while hanging onto two onion rings is shown]
Johnny: Or when Plankton won the hearts of millions by performing this perfect onion ring routine... with a broken antenna?
[A cast is around Plankton's left antenna. Plankton is shown in the number one spot on the podium this time, with Mr. Krabs below him]
Johnny: Krabs wasn't moved.
[Mr. Krabs blows Plankton off the podium]
Johnny: And now, late word is that this year, the Krusty Krab will be represented by a new competitor, on what is perhaps the greatest day of his young life. [A picture of a shadowy figure of a body with a question mark over it appears. The figure turns around and is revealed to be SpongeBob, wearing a sweatband and sports uniform. SpongeBob is standing next to Mr. Krabs, who is sitting on a bench staring at a stopwatch]
SpongeBob: This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr. Krabs.
[SpongeBob starts jogging in place]
SpongeBob: I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games.
[A spotlight shines down on him and he puts his hand on his heart]
SpongeBob: To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: And all that free publicity will bring in customers! So don't lose!
[Mr. Krabs walks away]
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
[SpongeBob starts doing pushups]
SpongeBob: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
[Patrick walks up]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob stops]
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick.
[SpongeBob continues doing pushups]
SpongeBob: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
[SpongeBob starts groaning]
Patrick: Are you trying to move the ground? You'll never move it like that. You gotta get under... [Patrick rips the piece of grass out from under SpongeBob, flipping him over] …neath it!
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games.
Patrick: Games? Can I play?
SpongeBob: Ah, sorry, Patrick.
[SpongeBob starts jumping rope]
SpongeBob: You have to be a fry cook.
Patrick: Be a fry cook? Is that all I gotta do? That'll be easy!
[SpongeBob tosses his jump rope behind him]
SpongeBob: What do you mean easy?
[Patrick laughs]
Patrick: How hard can it be?
SpongeBob: They don't let just anybody be a fry cook. We're an elite corp!
Patrick: Oh, come on. You're just flippin' patties.
SpongeBob: Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!
[Patrick flips a rock over with his foot]
Patrick: Tssss...
SpongeBob: Why don't you go home, Patrick? You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games!
[Patrick gasps]
Patrick: Well, at least I don't polish my fingernails.
[SpongeBob gasps and points at Patrick]
SpongeBob: You take that back!
[SpongeBob's index finger gleams. Patrick dances around]
Patrick: Fingernails! Fingernails! Fingernails!
SpongeBob: You don't even have fingernails.
Patrick: I cannot believe what I am hearing!
SpongeBob: [shouts] How can you hear it?! You don't have ears either!
[Patrick stutters]
Patrick: Holes! Holes!
SpongeBob: Cone head!
Patrick: Yellow!
SpongeBob: Pink!
[Patrick screams and holds his head]
Patrick: I'm gonna get a job as a fry cook and it'll be easy!
[Patrick walks off. SpongeBob growls and starts doing pushups again, but this time, he does it faster]
SpongeBob: Fine! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
[Mr. Krabs sniffs the air]
Mr. Krabs: What's that smell in the air? I smell Plankton!
[Camera zooms over to Plankton, who is standing in the entranceway of the stadium. Plankton pulls out a human nose from behind him]
Plankton: Oh yeah?! Well, I smell...[Plankton sniffs himself] Pew! He's right.
[Mr. Krabs runs over, his feet twinkling. Plankton does the same. Mr. Krabs makes a Broadway pose as corresponding music plays. Plankton makes a similar pose, holding a cane and a top hat. Mr. Krabs plays a piano, while Plankton blows into a tuba, messing up the rhythm]
Plankton: I love messing things up.
[Plankton meets up with Mr. Krabs by getting on a small platform and pulling a lever, which goes up to Mr. Krabs' height]
Plankton: Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Always ready, Plankton. Always ready.
Plankton: Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick... [Plankton raises his arm and accidentally whacks the lever, causing him to lower again. He raises it back up] ...your carapace!
Mr. Krabs: That's what you think, but I got me a champion-- SpongeBob! Show him! [SpongeBob does a karate routine, using two spatulas as nunchucks, then laughs innocently when he finishes] Look at him. In his prime. You ain't got no chance!
Plankton: That's where you're wrong, Krabs, for I too have a champion. [Plankton lowers a microphone] Ladies and gentlemen, turn your attention to the southwest corridor! [The crowd turns to the southeast corridor] Other way! [under his breath] Imbeciles. [The crowd turns to the southwest corridor] And... stop! Perfect. [In the entranceway, an extremely large shadow approaches, making loud stomps on the way] Representing the Chum Bucket, a creature so fearsome, so terrible, so mind-bendingly large, that those of you with weak constitutions may want to leave the stadium. [Two parents cover up their child's eyes, and he covers theirs. Mr. Krabs' eyes and nose sink into his shell. A muscular fish sits, trembling in the audience. He quickly gets up to leave]
Muscular Fish: I gotta get outta here!
Plankton: Too late! Ready or not, here he comes. Quake with fear, you mortal fools. Bow down before the awesome might of... [The wall of the stadium explodes. Fish fly everywhere. When the dust clears up, a huge, purple muscular fish is seen] ...this huge guy who is carrying the real contestant... [The huge fish turns around, revealing Patrick to be strapped to his back] ...Patrick Star!
[Patrick waves happily. SpongeBob stares in shock. He walks up as Patrick gets down from the huge fish's back]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing here? You're not a fry cook.
Patrick: Oh, yes I am, Mr. SpongeBob SuperiorPants.
[Patrick lifts up his shirt]
Patrick: Check it out!
[A name tag is stuck to his chest that says, "The Chum Bucket, Patrick."]
Patrick: I've been working for the Chum Bucket for almost five minutes.
SpongeBob: Well, it doesn't matter anyway, 'cause you're gonna eat my dust.
Patrick: Nuh-uh. I'm eating my own dust!
SpongeBob: Not if I eat it first!
Patrick: Yellow!
SpongeBob: Pink!
[The two walk away]
SpongeBob: I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. I thought Patrick was my friend.
Mr. Krabs: Friend? Not in here, he ain't.
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Plankton: He's not really your friend.
Patrick: He's not?
Plankton: He's plotting your downfall right now!
SpongeBob: He is?
Mr. Krabs: He's gonna stab you in the back.
Patrick: He wouldn't!
Plankton: Of course he would. Just look at him. Square: the shape of evil!
Mr. Krabs: He's making a mockery of your profession. Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: No!
Plankton: Then get mean!
Patrick: I'm mean!
Mr. Krabs: Get angry!
SpongeBob: I'm angry!
Plankton: Now get out there!
Mr. Krabs: And win...
Plankton: That...
Mr. Krabs: Medal!
Patrick: [screams]
SpongeBob: [screams]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both scream]
Huge Fish: [weak scream] Ahhh.
[Scene cuts to the first event]
Johnny: Our first event, the deep fry pole vault. [A deep fryer labeled "Fry King" sits in front of two high poles. SpongeBob stands in front of Mr. Krabs, holding a long pole]
Mr. Krabs: Win this one for the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: For the Krusty Krab! [SpongeBob flips over the poles and the deep fry and splats down on the circle drawn in the ground. The crowd gasps. SpongeBob forms a number one sign and the crowd cheers]
Plankton: Win this one because I told you to.
Patrick: Because you told me to! [Patrick flips over the poles, but lands on the handle of the deep fryer, flinging it at the crowd and turning them into fish sticks. A vendor walks up and turns on a heat lamp]
Lou: Fish sticks! Get your fish sticks here!
[Scene cuts to the second event. SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in front of a tall ladder that leads to a diving board, perched above a bowl of chocolate syrup]
Johnny: The next event: the chocolate high dive.
SpongeBob: Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick.
[SpongeBob climbs up the ladder]
Johnny: For his dive, SpongeBob will be attempting a full banana fudge pop with two sticks.
[SpongeBob holds up two popsicle sticks and sticks them into the top of his head]
Johnny: And now, absolute silence.
[The crowd stops chattering. SpongeBob jumps off the diving board]
SpongeBob: I scream for ice cream! [SpongeBob flips around a couple times, then leaps toward the bowl. He lands in the chocolate syrup, getting coated in it, then hops out of it and into a sandbox full of toasted almonds]
Johnny: Perfect entry! And toasted almonds? That's unexpected.
[SpongeBob lands in the circle]
Johnny: He stuck it!
[SpongeBob turns around toward the camera and grins]
Johnny: And just look at that even coating.
[SpongeBob walks upside-down past Patrick, using the popsicle sticks for legs]
SpongeBob: Top that, Pinky.
[Plankton walks up]
Plankton: Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!
[Patrick groans]
Plankton: Better than you!
[Patrick groans louder]
Plankton: Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!
[Patrick screams, then hops up onto the diving board with the lower half of his body inside an ice cream cone]
Johnny: Patrick will be resurrecting an old favorite. The single scoop strawberry cone with a chocolate dip.
[Patrick slowly leans off the edge until he falls off the diving board]
Johnny: Just look at that concentration.
[Patrick splashes into the bowl, with chocolate syrup flying everywhere]
Johnny: Ooh, a little shaky on that entry.
[A live action strawberry cone with a chocolate dip is shown]
Johnny: But just look at that form!
[Patrick hops up to SpongeBob grinning while SpongeBob is very angry about losing]
Patrick: Take that, yellow boy!
SpongeBob: Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet.
Patrick: That's what you think, but it's not over yet.
[A clip of highlights from the games is shown, beginning with SpongeBob tossing a patty. Patrick skates on a large grill with butter on his feet. Patrick tosses a large bottle of ketchup up in the air. SpongeBob and Patrick race on a track carrying trays full of food; the two fly up in the air on two large spatulas. They both do a dance wearing colorful outfits and fruit hats, Patrick's being 12 and SpongeBob's being 27. The clip ends. A large arena on top of a hamburger is on screen. The realistic Fish Head is still reporting]
Johnny: It's not over yet! With the score tied, we go to our final event! Bun wrestling. Who will take home the gold? Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: [rubbing SpongeBob's shoulders] Don't forget, he called ye yellow.
[SpongeBob picks up a metal chain, bites off and chews up the middle of it. He bares his teeth, revealing the metal chain to now be attached to them like braces]
Johnny: Or Plankton of the Chum Bucket?
Plankton: Don't forget, he called you pink!
[Plankton hops away. Patrick growls as he picks up a lemon, rips it in half, puts both halves into each of his eyes and screams]
[Heavy metal music plays. The bell rings. SpongeBob tears off his blue robe, showing off his extremely large, muscular body. Patrick rips off his own green robe, underneath which he is wearing a business suit. He tears off the business suit, also revealing an extremely large, muscular body. The two dive at each other, screaming, until they collide. They wrestle and continue to wind up in twisted positions. They spin around and wind up wrestling with themselves. They realize this, and dive back at each other. Patrick sits on top of SpongeBob, holding his foot]
Patrick: Forget the Chum Bucket. This is personal.
[Patrick takes off SpongeBob's shoe and licks his foot slowly. SpongeBob screams in agony. The two wrestle again. SpongeBob sits on Patrick's chest and lifts up a pencil with the eraser side pointing toward Patrick. He slowly brings it down to his name tag and erases the "Pat" in "Patrick", leaving "rick"]
Patrick: [screams] No! My name's... not... Rick!
[Patrick tackles SpongeBob in a puff of smoke and the two wrestle once more before they stop]
SpongeBob: I don't like you!
Patrick: I don't like you more!
SpongeBob: I never liked you!
Patrick: I a thousand times never liked you!
SpongeBob: Pink!
Patrick: Yellow!
[They struggle to push each other until both of their pants rip and fall down. Patrick's underwear is yellow. SpongeBob's underwear is pink]
SpongeBob: Yellow?
Patrick: Pink?
[Their eyes start to water]
SpongeBob and Patrick: You do care!
[They both start crying and hug each other]
SpongeBob: Let's promise never to fight again, buddy.
Patrick: Yeah, pal. Let's go home.
[The two friends walk off whistling and holding hands. The crowd boos. Mr. Krabs runs up]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Where ya going?
[Plankton runs up next to Mr. Krabs]
Plankton: Get back here and kill each other!
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the stadium, with arms on each other's backs]
Patrick: You're my best friend ever.
SpongeBob: You too, Patrick.
Patrick: You know, these were white when I bought 'em.


[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office with an adding machine, singing.]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profit will make me wallet fat!♪
[His eyes bug out at the ticker tape]
Mr. Krabs: What?! Profits down three dollars from last month! I got to start running a tighter ship around here!
[Meanwhile, Squidward is helping Martha in his ordering boat at the dining area of the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab. Here's your change.
[Gives Martha a dollar, and she walks off. Mr. Krabs approaches him.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: What's with all this "change" nonsense?
[SpongeBob walks over, knotting his tie.]
SpongeBob: Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up! [Squidward becomes exasperated, and sighs deeply] Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe.
Squidward: You hardly pay us at all.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you.
[He hands his employees envelopes.]
Squidward: Ah, yes! Our meager restitution. [He takes the envelope and smells it] Ah, the sweet smell of payday. [He opens it and finds a pair of underwear] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning. [Trades envelopes with him] Here's your check.
[He gives SpongeBob an envelope as well.]
Mr. Krabs: And here's yours, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs. [Holds up his spatula] Grilling is my passion.
[Mr. Krabs greedily takes the envelope back]
Squidward: What is this!?! [He sees that there is a bill instead of a check. It charges Squidward for breathing, talking, standing, existing, lollygagging, and chewing] You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?
Mr. Krabs: There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it.
[SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, preparing money for him]
SpongeBob: 18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe. [Mr. Krabs is drooling over SpongeBob's cash, and Squidward pulls SpongeBob towards him]
Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob: I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him.
Squidward: Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same.
SpongeBob: Why?
Squidward: We've got to unite as workers and demand the respect we deserve from the boss! In fact, you and I should go on strike!
SpongeBob: Wow! You and me go on strike?
Squidward: Sure! After all, you like your job, right?
SpongeBob: Right!
Squidward: And you want to keep working here, right?
SpongeBob: Right!
Squidward: And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?
SpongeBob: Right!
Squidward: Then let's go on strike!
SpongeBob: Yay! A strike! [He starts to sing excitedly] ♪Goin' on a strike! We’re goin' on a strike!♪ I still don't know what a strike means. ♪But we're goin' on a strike!♪ [He inadvertently kicks Mr. Krabs in the butt as Krabs sweeps the floor] Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!
Mr. Krabs: A strike?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: You mean you're going to make picket signs?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And you're going to make protest speeches?
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah!
Mr. Krabs: And you're going to demand me respect?
SpongeBob: Yeah! [Cut to SpongeBob sobbing outside of the Krusty Krab] Noo... [Squidward is with him] No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was gonna get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I... [He cries more] Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm gonna be sick.
Squidward: SpongeBob! [He grabs SpongeBob and pulls him off the door, but his arms and legs stick] News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too! [SpongeBob is suctioned to the door. Squidward pulls him off again, and this time his face remains pressed against the door] This is exactly why we need to go on strike. [SpongeBob flies back to the door. Squidward pulls him off once more, and this time SpongeBob's front sticks to the door, and we can see his skeleton and internal organs on his other side] He can't treat us like this anymore! [SpongeBob goes back to the door and Squidward's eyes become bloodshot] He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap. [SpongeBob and Squidward look through the door to see Mr. Krabs blowing dust off his old "Help Wanted" sign] Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united! [SpongeBob holds Squidward's hand] Ahem.
SpongeBob: [withdraws his hand] Sorry.
Squidward: Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time, you'll have your job back and more.
SpongeBob: And more?
[He imagines himself in his Krusty Krew uniform hat, except his hat is much bigger]
Squidward: Alright, SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms, [He takes off his hat] they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so. [Squidward throws it into the ground and stomps on it] Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob hesitantly takes his hat off] That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground.
[SpongeBob attempts to do so, but the hat sticks to his hand like gum.]
SpongeBob: [wails] I can't do it, Squidward! This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me.
Squidward: SpongeBob, you're pathetic! Look, I threw my hat to the ground.
[A police fish walks up to Squidward with a ticket]
Officer John: Aha! A confession! Next time, think before you litter.
[He sticks the ticket to Squidward's forehead and leaves. Later, Squidward and SpongeBob are painting signs]
Squidward: Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking.
[SpongeBob holds up a picket fence on a stick]
SpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?
Squidward: Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!
[SpongeBob holds up a sign that has a finger picking his nose]
SpongeBob: How's this?
Squidward: ...No. [Picks up his] This is a picket sign: Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point. [SpongeBob holds up his similar one that reads "Krusty Krab Funfair"]
SpongeBob: How about this, Squidward?
Squidward: SpongeBob, it's "unfair," not "funfair"!
[A fish walks by]
Sandals: A funfair? Where? I could go for some fun.
SpongeBob: At the Krusty Krab.
Sandals: Hey, everybody! Let's go to the fun fair! [A crowd of fish trample Squidward to get the restaurant. Later, SpongeBob is holding a sign that says "No Fair!" on it]
SpongeBob: Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!
[A teenager fish with a cap and braces walks up]
Teenage Fry Cook: What the heck does that mean?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.
Teenage Fry Cook: Then you must be SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob: Yep!
Teenage Fry Cook: Dude, you are like a fry cook legend! Will you sign my spatula?
[He pulls out a pen]
SpongeBob: Anything for an aspiring fry cook. [SpongeBob signs the spatula] So, did you come down to help out the cause?
Teenage Fry Cook: No, I came to take your job.
[SpongeBob is shocked. The fish grabs his spatula and pen and runs into the Krusty Krab to apply for a job]
Teenage Fry Cook: Hey, thanks, dude!
[Squidward walks up and bellows at SpongeBob through the megaphone so loudly that his facial features fall off, and he flies away.]
Squidward: Attention, SpongeBob! You are a terrible striker! [SpongeBob inserts his eyes into their sockets] You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward. [He holds up a sign reading, "I Heart the Krusty Krab"] How about I try the signs again?
Squidward: [into megaphone] Forget the signs! I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.
[SpongeBob stands next to a telephone pole.]
SpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?
Squidward: Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect. [We see that SpongeBob is now hidden behind the telephone pole. As Squidward begins to speaks, a crowd gathers] Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!
Miss Shell: I knew it!
[She slaps Dennis]
Squidward: The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr. Krabs!
[The crowd cheers]
Archie: Hey, what's that guy talking about?
Francis: I don't know, but he's got a megaphone.
Squidward: We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity!
[The crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: [From behind pole] Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing.
Squidward: With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!
[He speaks into Fred's face, and his eyes shoot into the back of his head. Then, they return to their sockets. Everyone cheers.]
Billy (lime fish): Wow, all this supporting is making me hungry.
Sandals: Hey, everybody! Let's go get a Krabby Patty.
[Everyone cheers and run into the Krusty Krab, once again trampling Squidward.]
Squidward: Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification.
[SpongeBob walks up to him.]
SpongeBob: That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands.
Mr. Krabs: But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!
SpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... um... Squidward, what was that other part?
Squidward: Dismantle your oppressive establishment?
SpongeBob: Yeah, that, too!
[Mr. Krabs pretends to yawn and leaves]
SpongeBob: And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!
[Squidward's eyes become bloodshot. SpongeBob's voice echoes "forever" in Squidward's mind as he opens the door to his house, takes a bath, looks in the mirror, and sits in bed, wide-eyed. He seems to have a case of insomnia as the word haunts him.]
Squidward: On strike with SpongeBob... forever?! [He imagines himself as an old man with a white beard holding a sign reading, "Krusty Still Unfair." Cobwebs branch from him to the ground. An old SpongeBob approaches him, supported by a cane]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day. [tugs Squidward's beard] Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward? [bonks Squidward on the head with his cane] Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward? [floats around Squidward] Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?
[Back to reality as Squidward lies in bed screaming.]
Squidward: I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!
[He runs to the door and opens it, and Krabs is there in his nightclothes, about to knock on it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy. [He grovels at Squidward's feet] The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone! [The teenagers appear right outside the door]
Teenagers: Alright, Mr. Krabs! [They give him the thumbs up]
Mr. Krabs: See what I mean? [sobbing] Squidward, please! You gotta come back!
Squidward: You'll give us anything we want?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms?
Mr. Krabs: I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.
[Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's pineapple house, where he sits on his bed listening to a country record]
SpongeBob: Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action! [He kicks open his front door, hammer and saw in hand. He runs to the Krusty Krab and into the dining room] I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board! [He pulls up a loose floorboard. He then saws a table in half] I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business! [He takes a bite out of a wooden column. Mouth full] Squidward will be so proud!
[Cut to Squidward and Krabs, now fully dressed, walking to the Krusty Krab at dawn.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations.
Squidward: I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!
[Squidward sees a disassembled Krusty Krab and screams. Krabs seems not to notice and hums as he puts his key where the door used to be, unlocking nothing. SpongeBob peeks out from the mangled sign pole. He runs out, trying to hold in his laughter.]
Squidward: S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?
SpongeBob: I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure.
[Krabs walks through the rubble of the Krusty Krab, oblivious, and sits in his chair. Only then, does he see the debris. Only the floor and base of the walls remain, so when he looks straight ahead from his chair, he can see Squidward and SpongeBob at the dilapidated door frame. Krabs' arms pop off followed by his eyes. His head slides off his torso and onto the floor where his nose falls out of it. Then his pelvis and legs fall out of his chair.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob is excited, but Squidward is nervous.]
Both: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: Here it comes!
Mr. Krabs: In order to pay off these damages, you two are gonna work for me forever!
SpongeBob: Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever!
["Forever" once again echoes inside Squidward's mind, and the camera zooms in on his bloodshot eyes.]
Narrator: One eternity later...
[The Krusty Krab is shown to have full of dust, but without any customers. Cobwebs are everywhere. A skeleton Squidward brushes off the floor, and a skeleton SpongeBob waits in the ordering boat.]
